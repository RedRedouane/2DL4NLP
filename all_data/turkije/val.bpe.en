"When I was 11 , I remember w@@ ak@@ ing up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"My father was list@@ en@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big sm@@ ile on his face which was unu@@ su@@ al then , because the news mos@@ tly de@@ pres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I d@@ res@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no longer allo@@ wed to be outside al@@ one , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be edu@@ cated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would su@@ spe@@ ct where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our book@@ s in gro@@ cer@@ y ba@@ gs so it would see@@ m we were just out sh@@ opp@@ ing .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in su@@ m@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the te@@ ac@@ her , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be can@@ ce@@ led for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ lo@@ wed ?
D@@ o they know where we live ?
"We were s@@ car@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
My gran@@ d@@ father was an extra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ v@@ ince of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , he in@@ si@@ s@@ ted that his da@@ u@@ ghter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my edu@@ cated mother became a te@@ ac@@ her .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for gir@@ ls and women in our neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to rece@@ ive an education .
"There was no question that his children would rece@@ ive an education , inclu@@ ding his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , de@@ sp@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ at@@ er risk in not edu@@ c@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted by our life and always being s@@ car@@ ed and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my da@@ u@@ ghter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to se@@ ll our blo@@ od to pay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ i@@ sed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by deca@@ des of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ yon@@ d high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I stand here a p@@ rou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ bur@@ y C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , my gran@@ d@@ father , the one ex@@ i@@ led from his home for dar@@ ing to edu@@ c@@ ate his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters , was a@@ mon@@ g the first to con@@ gra@@ tu@@ late me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ ul ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ a@@ ms even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n to edu@@ c@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for gir@@ ls in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ k@@ y for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
The ex@@ c@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at opport@@ unity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ posi@@ tion ."
"L@@ ik@@ e A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his da@@ u@@ ghter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their vil@@ la@@ ge , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kil@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side bo@@ m@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his da@@ u@@ ghter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my da@@ u@@ ghter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to real@@ ize about Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ es the value in his da@@ u@@ ghter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t key in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters , but in the con@@ text of a society like in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , we must have the supp@@ ort of men ."
"U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , gir@@ ls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundre@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million gir@@ ls are in school in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
( Applause ) Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the fra@@ gili@@ ty in changes .
I fe@@ ar that these changes will not last much be@@ yon@@ d the U.@@ S@@ . tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pro@@ mis@@ ing future and la@@ sting change ."
"T@@ o me , Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bili@@ ties , and every single day the gir@@ ls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ ik@@ e me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the yol@@ k and the wh@@ ite have se@@ para@@ ted .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more comple@@ x things appe@@ ar .
That &apos;s tw@@ ice as long as humans have been on this planet .
"And de@@ ep ben@@ e@@ ath those oce@@ ans , at cra@@ cks in the Earth &apos;s cru@@ st , you &apos;ve got he@@ at se@@ ep@@ ing up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ versity of ele@@ ments ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ o@@ tic chemi@@ stry ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings start pu@@ tting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person dan@@ ger@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ tra@@ ctive ?
A@@ re they a pot@@ ential mate ? A@@ re they a pot@@ ential net@@ working opport@@ unity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ tion when we me@@ et people to make a mental re@@ su@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Wh@@ ere are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more person@@ al with it .
Ha@@ ve you ever had any dise@@ ases ?
Ha@@ ve you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
Do@@ es your bre@@ ath s@@ me@@ ll bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ tion right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to s@@ le@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are neur@@ ologi@@ cally har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to se@@ ek out people like ourselves .
We start for@@ ming cli@@ qu@@ es as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce fe@@ els like .
"We bon@@ d together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , ra@@ ce , gen@@ der , the blo@@ ck that we gre@@ w up on ."
We se@@ ek out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ for@@ ce our person@@ al cho@@ ices .
"S@@ ome@@ times , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s open@@ ing a tin@@ y little bo@@ x and as@@ king you to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze yourself inside of it ."
"Because the ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies , I &apos;ve found , are too lim@@ iting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too n@@ ar@@ row .
And this can get really dan@@ ger@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a dis@@ cla@@ im@@ er about me , though , before we get too de@@ ep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was ra@@ i@@ sed in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn Man@@ ha@@ tt@@ an in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two blo@@ cks from the e@@ pic@@ en@@ ter of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of big@@ ot@@ ry and the social re@@ stri@@ ctions of a reli@@ gi@@ ous@@ ly@@ -@@ based up@@ br@@ in@@ ging .
"Wh@@ ere I come from , if you wer@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ e@@ en or a radi@@ cal thin@@ k@@ er or a performan@@ ce arti@@ st of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x up@@ br@@ in@@ ging , but as a k@@ id on the stre@@ ets of New York , you learn how to tru@@ st your own in@@ st@@ in@@ cts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids w@@ ouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all with them .
They said they w@@ ouldn &apos;t let gir@@ ls play .
"So I went home , and I s@@ ha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a gir@@ l , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ pt up the ch@@ ara@@ de for e@@ ight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was pla@@ ying a k@@ id na@@ med W@@ al@@ ter in a movi@@ e called &quot; &quot; Ju@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et t@@ ough that fol@@ lo@@ wed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ ger@@ ed him .
"S@@ e@@ e , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which d@@ ou@@ b@@ led up the la@@ yer@@ s of the performan@@ ce of my iden@@ ti@@ ty , because no one knew that I was actually a gir@@ l really pla@@ ying a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a gir@@ l — not my teach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the dire@@ c@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in cla@@ ss and gra@@ b me by the th@@ ro@@ at to che@@ ck for an A@@ dam &apos;s app@@ le or gra@@ b my c@@ r@@ ot@@ ch to che@@ ck what I was working with .
"When I would go to the ba@@ th@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the st@@ al@@ ls so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing standing up ."
A@@ t s@@ le@@ e@@ po@@ ver@@ s I would have pan@@ ic at@@ tac@@ ks trying to bre@@ ak it to gir@@ ls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th men@@ tion@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t ha@@ te my body or my gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was perfor@@ ming this e@@ labor@@ ate act .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fied as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have dia@@ gn@@ os@@ ed me as something like gen@@ der dy@@ s@@ mor@@ p@@ hi@@ c and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just w@@ ok@@ e up one day when I was 1@@ 4 , and I decided that I wanted to be a gir@@ l again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a gir@@ l me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a k@@ id beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sho@@ c@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to def@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fal@@ len in love , it was the last thing on e@@ ither of our min@@ ds to dis@@ cu@@ ss what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a gir@@ l ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I f@@ ell in love with a man , ne@@ ither of my parents bat@@ ted an e@@ ye@@ la@@ sh e@@ ither ."
"S@@ e@@ e , it &apos;s one of the great b@@ le@@ s@@ sin@@ gs of my very un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to def@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allo@@ wed to be me , gro@@ wing and chan@@ ging in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ posi@@ tion 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of du@@ st around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ri@@ ed wasn &apos;t really something I sp@@ ent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was stru@@ ck by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ n@@ ish@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts recor@@ d , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es so bla@@ tan@@ tly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion on tele@@ vision and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ para@@ tion of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was essen@@ ti@@ ally dra@@ wing ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies throu@@ gh@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion was dra@@ wing ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies around me ."
"If this was a war with two dis@@ par@@ ate si@@ des , I , by de@@ fa@@ ult , f@@ ell on team g@@ ay , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent stra@@ ight ."
"A@@ t the time I was just beginning to emer@@ ge from this e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year person@@ al iden@@ ti@@ ty cri@@ sis z@@ ig@@ za@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this aw@@ k@@ ward gir@@ l that looked like a bo@@ y in gir@@ l &apos;s c@@ lo@@ the@@ s to the op@@ pos@@ ite extre@@ me of this su@@ per sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ comp@@ en@@ sa@@ ting , boy@@ -@@ ch@@ as@@ ing gir@@ ly@@ -@@ gir@@ l to finally just a he@@ si@@ t@@ ant exp@@ lor@@ ation of what I actually was , a to@@ m@@ boy@@ ish gir@@ l who lik@@ ed both boy@@ s and gir@@ ls de@@ pen@@ ding on the person ."
"I had sp@@ ent a year photo@@ graph@@ ing this new gener@@ ation of gir@@ ls , much like myself , who f@@ ell kind of be@@ twe@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ es — gir@@ ls who s@@ ka@@ te@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in la@@ cy under@@ we@@ ar , gir@@ ls who had boy@@ s &apos; ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts but wor@@ e gir@@ ly na@@ il poli@@ sh , gir@@ ls who had e@@ ye@@ s@@ ha@@ do@@ w to mat@@ ch their s@@ c@@ rap@@ ed k@@ ne@@ es , gir@@ ls who lik@@ ed gir@@ ls and boy@@ s who all lik@@ ed boy@@ s and gir@@ ls who all ha@@ ted being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their fre@@ e@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our u@@ top@@ ian bu@@ b@@ ble exp@@ lo@@ ded into these ra@@ ging de@@ ba@@ tes where p@@ un@@ di@@ ts started lik@@ en@@ ing our love to be@@ sti@@ ality on national tele@@ vision ."
"And this powerful a@@ war@@ en@@ ess rol@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my charac@@ ter ."
I was le@@ g@@ ally and indi@@ sp@@ ut@@ ably a secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en .
I was not an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st .
I wa@@ ve no fla@@ gs in my own life .
But I was pla@@ gu@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ote to stri@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the v@@ ast vari@@ ety of people that I knew based on one ele@@ ment of their charac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not de@@ ser@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even con@@ sci@@ ously met a v@@ ic@@ tim of their dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were cas@@ ting into secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them pa@@ use .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I fi@@ gu@@ red out a way where I could in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce them to each other photo@@ grap@@ hi@@ cally without any arti@@ fi@@ ce , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photo@@ grap@@ h you can ex@@ am@@ ine a lion &apos;s wh@@ is@@ k@@ ers without the fe@@ ar of him ri@@ pp@@ ing your face off .
"For me , photo@@ graph@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing film , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vie@@ wer to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t gone before , but most imp@@ or@@ tan@@ tly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe ma@@ gaz@@ ine in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced gener@@ ations of people to di@@ st@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew ex@@ is@@ ted through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a ser@@ ies of very simple p@@ ort@@ ra@@ its , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photo@@ grap@@ h any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent stra@@ ight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a lim@@ it@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I ran out in the fre@@ ez@@ ing c@@ old , and I photo@@ graph@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photo@@ graph@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fun@@ ded two we@@ eks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Mu@@ sic ) Video : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ let@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an arti@@ st born and ra@@ i@@ sed in New York C@@ ity . ( Mu@@ sic )"
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c recor@@ d of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .

My go@@ al is to show the human@@ ity that ex@@ ists in every one of us through the simp@@ li@@ city of a face .

The fi@@ ght for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts is not just about g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age .
"T@@ o@@ day in 2@@ 9 sta@@ tes , more than half of this country , you can le@@ g@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundre@@ ds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve sho@@ t 3@@ 00 fac@@ es in New York C@@ ity .

I want to take the project across the country .
"I want to vi@@ sit 25 American cities , and I want to sh@@ oo@@ t 4@@ ,000 or 5@@ ,000 people ."
This is my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts fi@@ ght of my gener@@ ation .

"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing us from all over the country , as@@ king us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted .
"So I changed my im@@ medi@@ ate go@@ al to 1@@ 0,000 fac@@ es ."
"That video was made in the sp@@ r@@ ing of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have tra@@ ve@@ led to almost 20 cities and photo@@ graph@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minu@@ te of just qui@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thou@@ s@@ and words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y ."
"So after tra@@ v@@ eling and talking to people in places like O@@ kla@@ ho@@ ma or s@@ mal@@ l-@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found ev@@ iden@@ ce that the in@@ iti@@ al pre@@ mi@@ se was de@@ ad on ."
V@@ i@@ si@@ bility really is key .
F@@ a@@ mili@@ ar@@ ity really is the ga@@ te@@ way dru@@ g to emp@@ a@@ thy .
"On@@ ce an issu@@ e pop@@ s up in your own bac@@ k@@ yar@@ d or a@@ mon@@ g@@ st your own family , you &apos;re far more lik@@ ely to exp@@ l@@ ore sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thy for it or exp@@ l@@ ore a new per@@ spe@@ ctive on it ."
"O@@ f course , in my tra@@ v@@ els I met people who le@@ g@@ ally di@@ v@@ or@@ ced their children for being other than stra@@ ight , but I also met people who were S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts who s@@ wit@@ ched ch@@ ur@@ ches because their child was a le@@ s@@ bi@@ an ."
S@@ par@@ king emp@@ a@@ thy had become the bac@@ k@@ b@@ one of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was star@@ ting to learn that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differ@@ ences between us .
"In fact , on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it high@@ li@@ ghts them ."
"It presen@@ ts , not just the comple@@ x@@ i@@ ties found in a pro@@ ce@@ s@@ sion of different human be@@ ings , but the comple@@ x@@ i@@ ties found within each individu@@ al person ."
"It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"A@@ t some point I realized that my mis@@ sion to photo@@ grap@@ h &quot; &quot; g@@ ays &quot; &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently fla@@ wed , because there were a million different s@@ ha@@ des of g@@ ay ."
"H@@ ere I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pet@@ u@@ ated the very thing I had sp@@ ent my life trying to av@@ o@@ id — yet another bo@@ x ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the re@@ le@@ ase form that asked people to qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent g@@ ay .
And I wat@@ ched so many ex@@ ist@@ ential cri@@ ses un@@ f@@ old in front of me .
( Laughter ) P@@ eople didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presen@@ ted with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y your open@@ ness ?
"On@@ ce they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 70 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mark@@ s ."
"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ por@@ tion of people iden@@ ti@@ fied as something that was much more n@@ u@@ an@@ ced ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of what I have come to re@@ fer to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be cle@@ ar though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ ss the issu@@ e of cho@@ ice ver@@ su@@ s bi@@ ological im@@ per@@ a@@ tive , because if any of you happen to be of the beli@@ ef that se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ en@@ tation is a cho@@ ice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge system is this : If you have g@@ ay people over here and you have stra@@ ight people over here , and while we reco@@ gn@@ ize that most people iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y as some@@ where clos@@ er to one bin@@ ary or another , there is this v@@ ast spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of people that ex@@ ist in between ."
And the reality that this presen@@ ts is a compli@@ cated one .
"Because , for example , if you pas@@ s a la@@ w that allo@@ ws a b@@ os@@ s to fir@@ e an emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e for ho@@ mos@@ ex@@ ual behavi@@ or , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two h@@ et@@ er@@ os@@ ex@@ ual experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two ho@@ mos@@ ex@@ ual experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
Wh@@ ere exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my tra@@ v@@ els is just what a po@@ or bin@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ en@@ tation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ v@@ eling so much and me@@ et@@ ing so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and De@@ mo@@ cra@@ ts and Re@@ publi@@ can@@ s and jo@@ cks and qu@@ e@@ en@@ s and every other pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation you can possi@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human ra@@ ce ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one le@@ g@@ al hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the sh@@ ared n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and stru@@ g@@ gle , just being other than stra@@ ight doesn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the en@@ d@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly appe@@ ars across more and more pla@@ t@@ for@@ ms , bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ters , bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book pa@@ ges , scre@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , perhaps in wat@@ ching this pro@@ ce@@ s@@ sion of human@@ ity , something interesting and u@@ se@@ ful will be@@ gin to happen ."
"H@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly these ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies , these bin@@ ar@@ ies , these over@@ -@@ simp@@ li@@ fied bo@@ x@@ es will be@@ gin to become u@@ se@@ less and they &apos;ll be@@ gin to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they des@@ cri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their multi@@ p@@ li@@ city .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me particu@@ lar@@ ly that you would cho@@ ose to den@@ y the right to h@@ ous@@ ing , the right to ad@@ op@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the fre@@ e@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to di@@ so@@ wn as your child or your bro@@ ther or your si@@ ster or your mother or your father , your neigh@@ b@@ or , your cou@@ sin , your un@@ cle , the pre@@ si@@ dent , your poli@@ ce woman or the fi@@ re@@ man ?"
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So ple@@ ase don &apos;t gre@@ et us as st@@ ran@@ gers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , peri@@ od ."
Thank you .

"A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing people I met there , I met a supp@@ or@@ ter of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , an N@@ G@@ O de@@ di@@ cated to er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ating modern day sla@@ very ."
"We started talking about sla@@ very , and really , I started learning about sla@@ very , for I had cer@@ tain@@ ly known it ex@@ is@@ ted in the world , but not to such a de@@ gre@@ e ."
"A@@ f@@ ter we fin@@ ish@@ ed talking , I felt so hor@@ ri@@ ble and hon@@ est@@ ly as@@ ha@@ med at my own la@@ ck of knowle@@ dge of this at@@ ro@@ city in my own li@@ fe@@ time , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?"

Th@@ us began my jour@@ ney into modern day sla@@ very .
"O@@ d@@ dly , I had been to many of these places before ."
S@@ ome I even consi@@ der@@ ed like my second home .
"But this time , I would see the s@@ ke@@ let@@ ons hi@@ d@@ den in the clos@@ et ."
A con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive es@@ ti@@ mate tel@@ ls us there are more than 2@@ 7 million people en@@ sla@@ ved in the world today .
That &apos;s d@@ ou@@ ble the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic sla@@ ve tra@@ de .
"A hun@@ d@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , an ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral sla@@ ve cost about three times the an@@ n@@ ual s@@ alar@@ y of an American work@@ er ."
"That equ@@ a@@ tes to about $ 5@@ 0,000 in today &apos;s money ."
"Y@@ et today , entire famili@@ es can be en@@ sla@@ ved for gener@@ ations over a de@@ b@@ t as small as $ 18 ."
"A@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly , sla@@ very gener@@ a@@ tes prof@@ its of more than $ 1@@ 3 billion wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de each year ."
"M@@ any have been tri@@ c@@ ked by fal@@ se pro@@ mi@@ ses of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re for@@ ced to work without pay under the thre@@ at of viol@@ ence , and they cannot walk away ."
"T@@ o@@ day &apos;s sla@@ very is about com@@ mer@@ ce , so the go@@ o@@ ds that en@@ sla@@ ved people produ@@ ce have value , but the people produ@@ cing them are di@@ sp@@ os@@ able ."
"S@@ la@@ very ex@@ ists every@@ where , ne@@ ar@@ ly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ le@@ g@@ al every@@ where in the world ."
"In India and Ne@@ p@@ al , I was in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns ."
This st@@ range and a@@ we@@ some si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into an@@ ci@@ ent E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or D@@ an@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"E@@ n@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed in temp@@ er@@ atu@@ res of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire famili@@ es in fact , were c@@ lo@@ ak@@ ed in a he@@ av@@ y b@@ lan@@ ket of du@@ st , while me@@ chan@@ ically st@@ ac@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and car@@ r@@ ying them from the s@@ cor@@ ching kil@@ ns to tru@@ cks hundre@@ ds of yar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ e@@ a@@ den@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion , they work s@@ ilen@@ tly , doing this tas@@ k over and over for 1@@ 6 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no bre@@ ak@@ s for food , no water bre@@ ak@@ s , and the sev@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ ential ."
So per@@ v@@ as@@ ive was the he@@ at and the du@@ st that my ca@@ mera became too ho@@ t to even tou@@ ch and ce@@ as@@ ed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cru@@ is@@ er to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air con@@ di@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my ca@@ mera is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ac@@ k in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to c@@ ry , but the ab@@ oli@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gra@@ b@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that . Ju@@ st don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very c@@ lear@@ ly expla@@ ined to me that emo@@ tional dis@@ pla@@ ys are very dan@@ ger@@ ous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them ."
I couldn &apos;t off@@ er them any dire@@ ct help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se si@@ tu@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to re@@ ly on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tru@@ s@@ ted that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my he@@ art@@ bre@@ ak ."
"In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , I found children car@@ r@@ ying st@@ one for mi@@ les down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tru@@ cks wa@@ iting at ro@@ ads be@@ low ."
"The big sh@@ e@@ ets of s@@ late were he@@ a@@ vi@@ er than the children car@@ r@@ ying them , and the kids ho@@ is@@ ted them from their he@@ ads using these han@@ d@@ made har@@ nes@@ ses of sti@@ cks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ ot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"H@@ ow can we af@@ fect something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ v@@ as@@ ive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ sla@@ ved , people working 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these vil@@ la@@ gers cla@@ i@@ med their fre@@ e@@ dom , the sla@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their h@@ ou@@ ses ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pet@@ ri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cen@@ ter r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ sev@@ ere , and ab@@ oli@@ tion@@ ists on the ground help@@ ed them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry le@@ ase of their own , so that now they do the same bac@@ k@@ -@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing work , but they do it for themselves , and they get pa@@ id for it , and they do it in fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word sla@@ very , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ fe@@ ly within this particular indu@@ stry ."
"In K@@ a@@ th@@ man@@ du , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x sla@@ ves themselves ."
"They u@@ sh@@ er@@ ed me down a n@@ ar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this dir@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent li@@ t bas@@ e@@ ment ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
"C@@ a@@ bin re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ u@@ es for for@@ ced pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , pri@@ v@@ ate ro@@ o@@ ms , where the sla@@ ves , women , along with young gir@@ ls and boy@@ s , some as young as seven years old , are for@@ ced to en@@ ter@@ tain the cli@@ ents , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ bi@@ cle is dar@@ k and din@@ gy , iden@@ ti@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and parti@@ tion@@ ed by p@@ ly@@ wo@@ od and a cur@@ tain ."
The work@@ ers here often en@@ du@@ re tra@@ gi@@ c se@@ x@@ ual ab@@ use at the hands of their cu@@ sto@@ mers .
"S@@ tan@@ ding in the ne@@ ar d@@ ark@@ ness , I remember fe@@ eling this quic@@ k , ho@@ t fe@@ ar , and in that in@@ st@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ app@@ ed in that h@@ ell ."
I had only one way out : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to cli@@ m@@ b through .
"These people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ je@@ ct , it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that sla@@ very , inclu@@ ding se@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own bac@@ k@@ yar@@ d as well ."
"T@@ en@@ s of hundre@@ ds of people are en@@ sla@@ ved in ag@@ ri@@ culture , in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , in do@@ me@@ stic serv@@ it@@ u@@ de , and the li@@ st can go on ."
"@@ Re@@ cen@@ tly , the New York T@@ i@@ mes re@@ por@@ ted that between 10@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are s@@ old into se@@ x sla@@ very every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The te@@ x@@ ti@@ le indu@@ stry is another one we often think of when we hear about sla@@ ve la@@ b@@ or .
I vi@@ si@@ ted vil@@ la@@ ges in India where entire famili@@ es were en@@ sla@@ ved in the s@@ ilk tra@@ de .
This is a family p@@ ort@@ ra@@ it .
"The dy@@ ed black hands are the father , while the b@@ lue and red hands are his son@@ s ."
"They mi@@ x d@@ ye in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the s@@ ilk into the li@@ qu@@ id up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ ye is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"&quot; &quot; We have no fre@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get pa@@ id for our d@@ ye@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s es@@ ti@@ ma@@ ted that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ sla@@ ved on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta , the lar@@ gest man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ ri@@ ved , I went to have a quic@@ k look ."
"I saw what see@@ med to be a family f@@ ish@@ ing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ sla@@ ved .
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their famili@@ es and tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked and van@@ ish@@ ed , and they &apos;re for@@ ced to work en@@ d@@ less hours on these bo@@ at@@ s on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to s@@ w@@ im ."
This young child is e@@ ight years old .
"He was tre@@ mb@@ ling when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tin@@ y can@@ o@@ e ."
He was pet@@ ri@@ fied he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .
"The s@@ ke@@ let@@ al tre@@ e li@@ mb@@ s sub@@ mer@@ ged in L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta often cat@@ ch the f@@ ish@@ ing ne@@ ts , and we@@ ary , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed children are th@@ ro@@ wn into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lin@@ es ."
M@@ any of them dro@@ wn .
"For as long as he can re@@ call , he &apos;s been for@@ ced to work on the la@@ ke ."
"T@@ er@@ ri@@ fied of his ma@@ ster , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been tre@@ ated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger sla@@ ves that he man@@ a@@ ges ."
"I met these boy@@ s at five in the mor@@ ning , when they were ha@@ ul@@ ing in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ in the c@@ old , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that these ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh more than a thou@@ s@@ and p@@ ounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a f@@ ish@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ge .
I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves re@@ ha@@ bili@@ ta@@ tes v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of sla@@ very .
"H@@ ere he &apos;s seen taking a bat@@ h at the well , p@@ our@@ ing big bu@@ c@@ ket@@ s of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are si@@ tting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ uni@@ ted with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given to@@ ols to make a living and to keep their children sa@@ fe ."
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possi@@ bility .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
"D@@ ri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad in G@@ h@@ ana with part@@ ners of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , a fel@@ low ab@@ oli@@ tion@@ ist on a m@@ op@@ ed su@@ d@@ den@@ ly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ is@@ er and t@@ app@@ ed on the win@@ do@@ w ."
He told us to fol@@ low him down a dir@@ t ro@@ ad into the j@@ un@@ gle .
"A@@ t the end of the ro@@ ad , he ur@@ ged us out of the car , and told the dri@@ ver to quickly leave ."
"Th@@ en he poin@@ ted to@@ ward this bar@@ ely vi@@ sible fo@@ ot@@ pat@@ h , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the pat@@ h , this is the pat@@ h . G@@ o . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we started down the pat@@ h , we pu@@ shed as@@ ide the v@@ ines blo@@ c@@ king the way , and after about an h@@ our of wal@@ king in , found that the tra@@ il had become flo@@ o@@ ded by re@@ cent ra@@ ins , so I ho@@ is@@ ted the ph@@ ot@@ o ge@@ ar ab@@ o@@ ve my head as we des@@ cen@@ ded into these wat@@ ers up to my ch@@ est ."
"A@@ f@@ ter another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ rup@@ tly en@@ ded at a c@@ lear@@ ing , and before us was a mas@@ s of hol@@ es that could f@@ it into the size of a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all field , and all of them were full of en@@ sla@@ ved people labor@@ ing ."
"M@@ any women had children str@@ app@@ ed to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for g@@ old , w@@ ad@@ ing in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cur@@ y ."
M@@ er@@ cur@@ y is used in the extra@@ ction process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ sla@@ ved in a mine s@@ haf@@ t in another part of G@@ h@@ ana .
"When they came out of the s@@ haf@@ t , they were so@@ ak@@ ing w@@ et from their own s@@ we@@ at ."
"I remember looking into their ti@@ red , blo@@ od@@ sho@@ t eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 7@@ 2 hours ."
"The s@@ haf@@ ts are up to 3@@ 00 feet de@@ ep , and they car@@ ry out he@@ av@@ y ba@@ gs of st@@ one that later will be tran@@ sp@@ or@@ ted to another area , where the st@@ one will be p@@ oun@@ ded so that they can extra@@ ct the g@@ old ."
"A@@ t first g@@ lan@@ ce , the p@@ oun@@ ding site see@@ ms full of powerful men , but when we look clos@@ er , we see some less for@@ tun@@ ate working on the f@@ r@@ in@@ ges , and children too ."
"A@@ ll of them are v@@ ic@@ tim to in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , il@@ l@@ ness and viol@@ ence ."
"In fact , it &apos;s very lik@@ ely that this mus@@ cu@@ lar person will end up like this one here , ra@@ c@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is and mer@@ cur@@ y po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years ."
"This is Man@@ ur@@ u . Wh@@ en his father died , his un@@ cle tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es ."
"When his un@@ cle died , Man@@ ur@@ u in@@ her@@ i@@ ted his un@@ cle &apos;s de@@ b@@ t , which f@@ ur@@ ther for@@ ced him into being en@@ sla@@ ved in the min@@ es ."
"When I met him , he had been working in the min@@ es for 1@@ 4 years , and the le@@ g in@@ j@@ ur@@ y that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing ac@@ ci@@ dent , one so sev@@ ere do@@ c@@ tors say his le@@ g should be amp@@ u@@ ta@@ ted ."
"O@@ n top of that , Man@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is , yet he &apos;s still for@@ ced to work day in and day out in that mine s@@ haf@@ t ."
"E@@ ven still , he has a dre@@ am that he will become free and become edu@@ cated with the help of local ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , and it &apos;s this sort of de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , in the face of un@@ ima@@ gin@@ able od@@ ds , that fil@@ ls me with comple@@ te a@@ we ."
I want to sh@@ ine a light on sla@@ very .
"When I was working in the field , I b@@ rought lots of can@@ d@@ les with me , and with the help of my inter@@ pre@@ ter , I im@@ par@@ ted to the people I was photo@@ graph@@ ing that I wanted to il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate their stories and their p@@ light , so when it was sa@@ fe for them , and sa@@ fe for me , I made these ima@@ ges ."
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
"I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ aring wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do w@@ hatever we can to help make a difference in their lives ."
"I tru@@ ly believe , if we can see one another as fel@@ low human be@@ ings , then it be@@ comes very difficult to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate at@@ ro@@ cities like sla@@ very ."
"These ima@@ ges are not of issu@@ es . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all de@@ ser@@ ving of the same ri@@ ghts , di@@ gn@@ ity and re@@ spe@@ ct in their lives ."
"There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mi@@ stre@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous hon@@ or of me@@ et@@ ing ."
"I hope that these ima@@ ges aw@@ ak@@ en a for@@ ce in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that for@@ ce will i@@ gn@@ ite a fir@@ e , and that fir@@ e will sh@@ ine a light on sla@@ very , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ da@@ ge can contin@@ ue to live in the s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws ."

The de@@ cor@@ a@@ tive use of w@@ ire in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Africa da@@ tes back hundre@@ ds of years .
"But moder@@ n@@ iz@@ ation actually b@@ rought communi@@ cation and a whole new materi@@ al , in the form of tele@@ phone w@@ ire ."
R@@ ural to ur@@ b@@ an mi@@ gra@@ tion me@@ ant that ne@@ w@@ found indu@@ stri@@ al materi@@ als started to re@@ place har@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ co@@ me@@ -@@ by natural gr@@ as@@ ses .
"So , here you can see the change from use — star@@ ting to use con@@ temp@@ or@@ ary materi@@ als ."
These pi@@ e@@ ces da@@ te back from the &apos; 4@@ 0s to the late &apos; 5@@ 0s .
"In the &apos; 9@@ 0s , my inter@@ est and pas@@ sion for tran@@ si@@ tional art for@@ ms led me to a new form , which came from a squ@@ at@@ ter ca@@ mp outside D@@ ur@@ b@@ an ."
"And I got the opport@@ unity to start working with this community at that point , and started develop@@ ing , really , and men@@ tor@@ ing them in terms of scale , in terms of the design ."
And the project so@@ on gre@@ w from five to 50 we@@ a@@ ver@@ s in about a year .
"S@@ o@@ on we had out@@ gro@@ wn the s@@ cra@@ p yar@@ ds , what they could provi@@ de , so we co@@ er@@ ced a w@@ ire man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ er to help us , and not only to supp@@ ly the materi@@ als on bo@@ b@@ bin@@ s , but to produ@@ ce to our col@@ or speci@@ fi@@ ca@@ tions ."
"A@@ t the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possi@@ bility here to produ@@ ce con@@ temp@@ or@@ ary produ@@ cts , away from the e@@ th@@ ni@@ c , a little bit more con@@ temp@@ or@@ ary ."
So I develop@@ ed a whole range around — mas@@ s@@ -@@ produ@@ ced range — that obvi@@ ously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er@@ -@@ end de@@ c@@ or market that could be exp@@ or@@ ted and also ser@@ vice our local market .
"We started experim@@ en@@ ting , as you can see , in terms of shap@@ es , for@@ ms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pe@@ t project . It &apos;s suc@@ cess@@ ful , it &apos;s been run@@ ning for 12 years . And we supp@@ ly the Con@@ ran sh@@ op@@ s , and D@@ on@@ na K@@ ar@@ an , and so it &apos;s kind of great ."
"This is our group , our ma@@ in group of we@@ a@@ ver@@ s ."
They come on a we@@ ek@@ ly bas@@ is to D@@ ur@@ b@@ an .
They all have b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all mo@@ ved back to the ru@@ ral area where they came from .
It &apos;s a we@@ ek@@ ly tur@@ n@@ around of produ@@ ction .

And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .

"In an age of global stri@@ fe and cli@@ mate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is se@@ x so da@@ m@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ac@@ k in uni@@ versity , we had a quic@@ k project to design some sol@@ ar-@@ power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s my c@@ lo@@ ck .
"It uses something called the d@@ war@@ f sun@@ flo@@ wer , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ches in he@@ ight ."
"Now , as you know , sun@@ flo@@ w@@ ers tra@@ ck the sun during the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which dire@@ ction the sun@@ flo@@ wer is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the b@@ lan@@ k area in the bas@@ e ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed posi@@ tion of the sun@@ flo@@ wer , and in the ev@@ en@@ ing again , and that &apos;s your c@@ lo@@ ck ."
"Now , I know my c@@ lo@@ ck doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a flo@@ wer ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed , sub@@ je@@ ctive op@@ in@@ i@@ on , it &apos;s br@@ il@@ li@@ ant ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck ."
It &apos;s five ma@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gla@@ s@@ ses with a sho@@ t gla@@ ss under each one .
In each sho@@ t gla@@ ss is a different s@@ cen@@ ted oil .
"In the mor@@ ning , the sun@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first ma@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gla@@ ss , focu@@ sing a be@@ am of light on the sho@@ t gla@@ ss under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the s@@ cen@@ ted oil inside , and a particular s@@ me@@ ll will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different s@@ me@@ l@@ ls are dis@@ per@@ sed throu@@ gh@@ out that environment ."
An@@ y@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the s@@ me@@ ll .
You can see why I ha@@ te Ch@@ r@@ is .
One thing you have to know about me is I ha@@ te to l@@ ose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ g@@ ging me for well over a deca@@ de .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the so@@ lar power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks project , a young la@@ dy I knew sug@@ ge@@ s@@ ted maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ ences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"T@@ o do this , I de@@ vi@@ sed something called the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have a scale from zer@@ o to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"An@@ y@@ time I had a me@@ mor@@ able experience in my life , I would recor@@ d it on this grap@@ h like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a quic@@ k video to show you how it works .
"B@@ ik@@ e desig@@ ner : This is &#91; un@@ cle@@ ar &#93; , cu@@ st@@ om bi@@ ke desig@@ ner ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ c@@ yle re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; S@@ me@@ ll &#93; &#91; T@@ as@@ te &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h works .
So here are some other res@@ ul@@ ts .
The first is for in@@ st@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , tas@@ te and s@@ me@@ ll are quite high , but no@@ ti@@ ce sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , clu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do han@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mo@@ king ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers told me the sen@@ sa@@ tion of hol@@ ding a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te and br@@ in@@ ging it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mo@@ king experience , which sho@@ ws , it &apos;s kind of s@@ car@@ y to think how well ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the per@@ fect experience look like on the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ?"
"It would , of course , be a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as in@@ ten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the per@@ fect one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . Gre@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ es@@ p@@ on@@ dents said that great se@@ x h@@ its all of the five sen@@ ses at an extre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help expla@@ in why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly reme@@ mb@@ er@@ ed the sol@@ ar-@@ power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks project from my y@@ outh ."
And I realized this the@@ ory also expla@@ ins why Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck is so much better than mine .
"You see , my c@@ lo@@ ck only focu@@ ses on si@@ ght , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck .
It &apos;s the first c@@ lo@@ ck ever that uses s@@ me@@ ll to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck is a re@@ v@@ olution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory ta@@ u@@ ght me about my field .
"You see , up ti@@ ll now , us desig@@ ners , we &apos;ve ma@@ in@@ ly focu@@ sed on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ nor@@ ed the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck sho@@ ws us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant produ@@ ct .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three quic@@ k ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ fu@@ ma@@ tor . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I b@@ ru@@ sh my te@@ et@@ h tw@@ ice a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh that tas@@ tes like can@@ dy , and when the tas@@ te of can@@ dy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a f@@ lu@@ te or a c@@ lar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pre@@ ss down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the f@@ lu@@ te or the c@@ lar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ stru@@ ment I do play : the tele@@ vision re@@ m@@ ote control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll no@@ ti@@ ce that the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produ@@ cts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I real@@ ize the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emo@@ tions and that el@@ u@@ sive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
M@@ ay@@ be that could be the top@@ ic of my next talk .
"U@@ n@@ til then , ple@@ ase have f@@ un using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
All right .

"When I was six years old , I rece@@ i@@ ved my gi@@ f@@ ts ."
She wanted us to experience rece@@ i@@ ving gi@@ f@@ ts but also learning the vir@@ tu@@ e of compli@@ men@@ ting each other .
"So she had all of us come to the front of the cla@@ ss@@ room , and she b@@ ou@@ ght all of us gi@@ f@@ ts and st@@ ac@@ ked them in the cor@@ ner ."
"If you hear your name called , go and pic@@ k up your gi@@ ft and sit down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?"
What could go wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Well , there were 40 of us to start with , and every time I heard someone &apos;s name called , I would give out the he@@ arti@@ est che@@ er ."
"And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ..."
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the compli@@ ments st@@ opp@@ ed .
"Well , at that moment , I was c@@ r@@ ying ."
And the te@@ ac@@ her was fre@@ ak@@ ing out .
"S@@ he was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , would any@@ one say anything ni@@ ce about these people ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No one ? OK , why don &apos;t you go get your gi@@ ft and sit down ."
"So be@@ have next year — someone might say something ni@@ ce about you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , as I &apos;m des@@ cri@@ b@@ ing this you , you probably know I remember this really well . ( Laughter )"
But I don &apos;t know who felt wor@@ se that day .
W@@ as it me or the te@@ ac@@ her ?
She must have realized that she turned a te@@ am@@ -@@ building ev@@ ent into a public ro@@ ast for three si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds .
And without the h@@ um@@ or .
"You know , when you see people get ro@@ as@@ ted on T@@ V , it was fun@@ ny ."
There was nothing fun@@ ny about that day .
"So that was one ver@@ sion of me , and I would die to av@@ o@@ id being in that si@@ tu@@ ation again — to get re@@ je@@ cted in public again ."
That &apos;s one ver@@ sion .
Th@@ en fas@@ t-@@ for@@ ward e@@ ight years .
"B@@ ill G@@ a@@ tes came to my ho@@ me@@ to@@ wn — Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , China — to spe@@ ak , and I saw his messa@@ ge ."
I f@@ ell in love with that guy .
"I thought , w@@ ow , I know what I want to do now ."
"And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did wr@@ ite that let@@ ter ."
"And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad han@@ d@@ wr@@ iting , but I did high@@ light some key words ."
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another ver@@ sion of me : one who will con@@ qu@@ er the world .
"Well , then two years later , I was presen@@ ted with the opport@@ unity to come to the United States ."
"I ju@@ mp@@ ed on it , because that was where B@@ ill G@@ a@@ tes li@@ ved , right ?"
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur jour@@ ney .
"Th@@ en , fas@@ t-@@ for@@ ward another 1@@ 4 years ."
I was 30 .
"N@@ op@@ e , I didn &apos;t build that company ."
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a mark@@ et@@ ing man@@ a@@ ger for a F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 500 company .
And I felt I was stu@@ ck ; I was sta@@ gn@@ ant .
Why is that ?
Wh@@ ere is that 1@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old who wr@@ ote that let@@ ter ?
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
One wanted to con@@ qu@@ er the world — make a difference — another was af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ je@@ ction .
And every time that si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old won .
And this fe@@ ar even per@@ si@@ s@@ ted after I started my own company .
"I mean , I started my own company when I was 30 — if you want to be B@@ ill G@@ a@@ tes , you &apos;ve got to start so@@ on@@ er or later , right ?"
"When I was an en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur , I was presen@@ ted with an inve@@ st@@ ment opport@@ unity , and then I was turned down ."
And that re@@ je@@ ction h@@ ur@@ t me .
It h@@ ur@@ t me so bad that I wanted to qu@@ it right there .
"But then I thought , he@@ y , would B@@ ill G@@ a@@ tes qu@@ it after a simple inve@@ st@@ ment re@@ je@@ ction ?"
W@@ ould any suc@@ cess@@ ful en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur qu@@ it like that ?
No way .
And this is where it cli@@ c@@ ked for me .
"O@@ K , I can build a better company ."
"I can build a better team or better produ@@ ct , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better le@@ ad@@ er ."
I &apos;ve got to be a better person .
I cannot let that si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old keep di@@ c@@ t@@ ating my life any@@ more .
I have to put him back in his place .
So this is where I went on@@ line and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
"( Laughter ) I sear@@ ched , &quot; &quot; How do I over@@ come the fe@@ ar of re@@ je@@ ction ? &quot; &quot; I came up with a bun@@ ch of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ology ar@@ tic@@ les about where the fe@@ ar and pa@@ in are coming from ."
"Th@@ en I came up with a bun@@ ch of &quot; &quot; ra@@ h@@ -@@ ra@@ h &quot; &quot; in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tional ar@@ tic@@ les about &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t take it person@@ ally , just over@@ come it . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t know that ?"
( Laughter ) But why was I still so s@@ car@@ ed ?
Th@@ en I found this we@@ b@@ site by lu@@ ck .
It &apos;s called re@@ je@@ c@@ tion@@ ther@@ ap@@ y@@ .@@ com@@ .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Re@@ je@@ ction Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y &quot; &quot; was this game inven@@ ted by this C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur .
H@@ is name is J@@ as@@ on C@@ ome@@ ly .
"And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for re@@ je@@ ction , and every day get re@@ je@@ cted at something , and then by the end , you de@@ sen@@ si@@ ti@@ ze yourself from the pa@@ in ."
And I lo@@ ved that idea .
"( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this ."
"And I &apos;ll feel myself getting re@@ je@@ cted 100 days . &quot; &quot; And I came up with my own re@@ je@@ ction ideas , and I made a video blo@@ g out of it ."
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the blo@@ g looked like .
D@@ ay One ...
( Laughter ) B@@ or@@ row 100 dollars from a st@@ ran@@ ger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
He looked like a se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ard .
So I just appro@@ ach@@ ed him .
"And I was just wal@@ king and that was the lon@@ gest walk of my life — ha@@ ir on the back of my ne@@ ck standing up , I was s@@ we@@ ating and my heart was p@@ oun@@ ding ."
"And I got there and said , &quot; H@@ ey , si@@ r , can I bor@@ row 100 dollars from you ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;"
"And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I turned around , and I just ran ."
( Laughter ) I felt so e@@ mb@@ ar@@ ras@@ sed .
"But because I fil@@ med myself — so that night I was wat@@ ching myself getting re@@ je@@ cted , I just saw how s@@ car@@ ed I was ."
I looked like this k@@ id in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se . &quot; &quot; I saw de@@ ad people .
( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
"You know , he wasn &apos;t that men@@ ac@@ ing ."
"He was a ch@@ u@@ b@@ by , lo@@ ve@@ able guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he in@@ vi@@ ted me to expla@@ in myself ."
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
"I could &apos;ve expla@@ ined , I could &apos;ve ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated ."
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
All I did was run .
"I felt , w@@ ow , this is like a mi@@ cro@@ cos@@ m of my life ."
"E@@ very time I felt the sli@@ gh@@ test re@@ je@@ ction , I would just run as f@@ ast as I could ."
And you know what ?
"The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run ."
I &apos;ll st@@ ay en@@ ga@@ ged .
"D@@ ay T@@ w@@ o : Re@@ qu@@ est a &quot; &quot; bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s when I went to a bur@@ ger jo@@ int , I fin@@ ish@@ ed l@@ un@@ ch , and I went to the cas@@ hi@@ er and said , &quot; H@@ i , can I get a bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; ( Laughter )"
"He was all con@@ fu@@ sed , like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like a dr@@ ink re@@ f@@ ill but with a bur@@ ger . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , we don &apos;t do bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill , man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So this is where re@@ je@@ ction happened and I could have run , but I st@@ ay@@ ed ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I love your bur@@ gers , I love your jo@@ int , and if you guys do a bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill , I will love you guys more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , I &apos;ll tell my man@@ a@@ ger about it , and maybe we &apos;ll do it , but sor@@ ry , we can &apos;t do this today . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I left ."
"And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ."
( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
"But the life and death fe@@ eling I was fe@@ eling the first time was no longer there , just because I st@@ ay@@ ed en@@ ga@@ ged — because I didn &apos;t run ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , great , I &apos;m already learning things ."
Gre@@ at . &quot; &quot; And then D@@ ay Th@@ ree : G@@ et@@ ting O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic D@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ u@@ ts .
This is where my life was turned up@@ side down .
I went to a K@@ ri@@ sp@@ y K@@ re@@ me .
It &apos;s a d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut sho@@ p in ma@@ in@@ ly the S@@ ou@@ the@@ as@@ ter@@ n part of the United States .
"I &apos;m sure they have some here , too ."
"And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you make me d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ u@@ ts that look like O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic sy@@ mb@@ ols ?"
"B@@ as@@ ically , you inter@@ lin@@ k five d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ u@@ ts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say y@@ es , right ?"
The d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut mak@@ er took me so ser@@ i@@ ously .
"( Laughter ) So she put out p@@ aper , started j@@ ot@@ ting down the col@@ ors and the r@@ ings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a bo@@ x that looked like O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic r@@ ings ."
And I was so tou@@ ched .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million vie@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be .
The world couldn &apos;t believe that e@@ ither .
"( Laughter ) You know , because of that I was in ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , in talk sho@@ ws , in everything ."
And I became fa@@ mous .
"A lot of people started wr@@ iting e@@ ma@@ il@@ s to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is a@@ we@@ some . &quot; &quot; But you know , fa@@ me and not@@ ori@@ ety did not do anything to me ."
"What I really wanted to do was learn , and to change myself ."
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of re@@ je@@ ction into this pla@@ y@@ ground — into this research project .
I wanted to see what I could learn .
And then I learned a lot of things .
I disco@@ vered so many se@@ cre@@ ts .
"For example , I found if I just don &apos;t run , if I got re@@ je@@ cted , I could actually turn a &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; into a &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and the ma@@ gi@@ c word is , &quot; &quot; why . &quot; &quot; So one day I went to a st@@ ran@@ ger &apos;s house , I had this flo@@ wer in my hand , kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or and said , &quot; H@@ ey , can I plan@@ t this flo@@ wer in your bac@@ k@@ yar@@ d ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; H@@ ey , can I know why ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this do@@ g that would di@@ g up anything I put in the bac@@ k@@ yar@@ d ."
I don &apos;t want to was@@ te your flo@@ wer .
And she was so happy to see me .
"( Laughter ) And then half an h@@ our later , there was this flo@@ wer in Con@@ ni@@ e &apos;s bac@@ k@@ yar@@ d ."
I &apos;m sure it looks better now .
"( Laughter ) But had I left after the in@@ iti@@ al re@@ je@@ ction , I would &apos;ve thought , well , it &apos;s because the guy didn &apos;t tru@@ st me , it &apos;s because I was cra@@ z@@ y , because I didn &apos;t dre@@ ss up well , I didn &apos;t look good ."
It was because what I off@@ er@@ ed did not f@@ it what he wanted .
"And he tru@@ s@@ ted me enough to off@@ er me a re@@ fer@@ ral , using a sal@@ es ter@@ m ."
I conver@@ ted a re@@ fer@@ ral .
"So for example , one day I went to a S@@ tar@@ bu@@ cks , and asked the man@@ a@@ ger , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , can I be a S@@ tar@@ bu@@ cks gre@@ et@@ er ? &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a S@@ tar@@ bu@@ cks gre@@ et@@ er ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o you know those W@@ al@@ mar@@ t gre@@ et@@ ers ?"
"You know , those people who say &apos; hi &apos; to you before you walk in the stor@@ e , and make sure you don &apos;t ste@@ al stuff , basically ?"
"I want to give a W@@ al@@ mar@@ t experience to S@@ tar@@ bu@@ cks cu@@ sto@@ mers . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a good thing , actually — A@@ c@@ tually , I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s a bad thing ."
"And he was like , &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; — ye@@ ah , this is how he looked , his name is E@@ ri@@ c — and he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; This is how he was he@@ aring me . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot sure . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I ask him , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s really we@@ ird , man . &quot; &quot; But as so@@ on as he said that , his whole de@@ me@@ an@@ or changed ."
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s pu@@ tting all the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t on the flo@@ or .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , you can do this , just don &apos;t get too we@@ ird . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So for the next h@@ our I was the S@@ tar@@ bu@@ cks gre@@ et@@ er ."
"I said &quot; &quot; hi &quot; &quot; to every cu@@ sto@@ mer that wal@@ ked in , and gave them ho@@ li@@ day che@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the way , I don &apos;t know what your car@@ e@@ er tra@@ je@@ c@@ tor@@ y is , don &apos;t be a gre@@ et@@ er ."
( Laughter ) It was really bor@@ ing .
"But then I found I could do this because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; I men@@ tion@@ ed the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that he was having ."
"And because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t we@@ ird ."
"That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a we@@ ird thing ."
"And again , and again , I learned that if I men@@ tion some d@@ ou@@ b@@ t people might have before I ask the question , I ga@@ ined their tru@@ st ."
And then I learned I could ful@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am ...
by as@@ king .
"You know , I came from four gener@@ ations of teach@@ ers , and my gran@@ d@@ ma has always told me , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey J@@ ia , you can do anything you want , but it &apos;d be great if you became a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But I wanted to be an en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur , so I didn &apos;t ."
But it has always been my dre@@ am to actually te@@ ach something .
But because I didn &apos;t run — I ke@@ pt doing it — and on the third try the profes@@ s@@ or was very im@@ pres@@ sed .
"He was like , &quot; &quot; No one has done this before . &quot; &quot; And I came in pre@@ par@@ ed with power@@ poin@@ ts and my le@@ s@@ son ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I can use this ."
Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll f@@ it you in my cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was teach@@ ing a cla@@ ss .
"This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture ."
"You know , sometimes you get re@@ je@@ cted by li@@ gh@@ ting , you know ?"
"( Laughter ) But w@@ ow — when I fin@@ ish@@ ed teach@@ ing that cla@@ ss , I wal@@ ked out c@@ r@@ ying , because I thought I could ful@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am just by simply as@@ king ."
"I used to think I have to ac@@ compli@@ sh all these things — have to be a great en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur , or get a P@@ h@@ D to te@@ ach — but no , I just asked , and I could te@@ ach ."
"And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quot@@ ed Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with in@@ iti@@ al and often viol@@ ent re@@ je@@ ctions ."
"P@@ eople like Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , like Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ an@@ d@@ hi , N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la , or even J@@ e@@ su@@ s Ch@@ ri@@ st ."
These people did not let re@@ je@@ ction def@@ ine them .

And they e@@ mb@@ ra@@ ced re@@ je@@ ction .
"And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about re@@ je@@ ction , and in my case , re@@ je@@ ction was my cur@@ se , was my bo@@ o@@ ge@@ y@@ man ."
It has bo@@ ther@@ ed me my whole life because I was run@@ ning away from it .
Th@@ en I started e@@ mb@@ ra@@ cing it .
I turned that into the big@@ gest gi@@ ft in my life .
I started teach@@ ing people how to turn re@@ je@@ ctions into opport@@ uni@@ ties .

"When you get re@@ je@@ cted in life , when you are fac@@ ing the next ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le or next fa@@ il@@ ure , consi@@ der the possi@@ bili@@ ties ."

"( Ara@@ bi@@ c ) I se@@ ek re@@ fu@@ ge in Al@@ la@@ h from cur@@ sed S@@ at@@ an . In the Na@@ me of Al@@ la@@ h , the most G@@ ra@@ ci@@ ous , the most M@@ er@@ ci@@ ful ."
( En@@ gli@@ sh ) I was born in a middle cla@@ ss family .
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a bo@@ y or a gir@@ l : they were going to go to school .
So I gu@@ ess I was the lu@@ ck@@ y one .
My mother had 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ ci@@ es .
"F@@ rom 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ ci@@ es , five of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
"D@@ ay to day , I wat@@ ched women being car@@ ri@@ ed to a gra@@ ve@@ yar@@ d , or wat@@ ched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ yar@@ d ."
"A@@ t that time , when I fin@@ ish@@ ed my high school , I really wanted to be a do@@ ctor ."
I wanted to be a do@@ ctor to help women and children .
"So I comple@@ ted my education , but I wanted to go to uni@@ versity ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a d@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ ory for gir@@ ls , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in medi@@ cal school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a res@@ ult , my father s@@ ent me to America ."
I came to America .
I comple@@ ted my education .
"Wh@@ ile I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was in@@ va@@ ded by R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
"And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country ."
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ mp .
"So as so@@ on as I comple@@ ted my education , I b@@ rought my family to America ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
"D@@ ay after day , when I list@@ en@@ ed to the news , when I fol@@ lo@@ wed what was going on with my country , my heart was bre@@ ak@@ ing up ."
"I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me ."
I had a good job .
I was a profes@@ s@@ or at a uni@@ versity .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ mp .
"And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ mp in P@@ ak@@ istan , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"A@@ b@@ out 9@@ 0 percent of them were women and children . M@@ ost of the men have been kil@@ led or they were in war . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ mp ,"
"@@ when I went day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ ve@@ y , I found things you never could imagine ."
I saw a wi@@ do@@ w with five to e@@ ight children si@@ tting there and we@@ ep@@ ing and not kno@@ wing what to do .
"I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live ."
So it was a very dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating si@@ tu@@ ation .
"My heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do ."
"A@@ t that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
"But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life ."
It trans@@ for@@ med me . It gave me st@@ at@@ us .
It gave me con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce . It gave me a car@@ e@@ er .
"And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after ."
But do you think it was easy ?
"N@@ o , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls , completely ."
"And also , by R@@ us@@ si@@ a inv@@ ad@@ ing Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , people were not tru@@ sting any@@ one ."
"It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I ?"
S@@ ome@@ body who comes from the United States .
S@@ ome@@ body who got edu@@ cated here .
D@@ id they tru@@ st me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really needed to build the tru@@ st in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed and looked and looked .
I asked .
"F@@ in@@ ally , I found one man ."
He was 80 years old .
He was a m@@ ul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his t@@ ent in the ca@@ mp , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot;"
"And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ raz@@ y woman , cra@@ z@@ y woman , how do you think I can be a te@@ ac@@ her ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot; &quot; F@@ in@@ ally , he ac@@ cep@@ ted my off@@ er , and once I started a cla@@ ss in his comp@@ ound , the word sp@@ read all over ."
"In a matter of one year , we had 25 sch@@ o@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing ."
"@@ one day I was in the of@@ fi@@ ce in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"A@@ ll of a su@@ d@@ den , I saw my st@@ af@@ f run@@ ning to ro@@ o@@ ms and lo@@ c@@ king the do@@ ors and telling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ un away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a le@@ ad@@ er , what do you do ?"
You &apos;re s@@ car@@ ed . You know it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
"But as a le@@ ad@@ er , you have to h@@ old it together ."
You have to h@@ old it together and show st@@ ren@@ g@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were p@@ our@@ ing into my of@@ fi@@ ce ."
So I in@@ vi@@ ted them to the of@@ fi@@ ce .
"They came , and there were n@@ ine of them — n@@ ine T@@ ali@@ b@@ an ."
They were the u@@ gli@@ est looking men you can ever see .
"( Laughter ) V@@ er@@ y me@@ an@@ -@@ looking people , black c@@ lo@@ the@@ s , black tur@@ b@@ an , and they p@@ our into my of@@ fi@@ ce ."
And I in@@ vi@@ ted them to have a se@@ at and have te@@ a .
They said no . They are not going to dr@@ ink te@@ a .
"And of course , with the t@@ one of vo@@ ice they were using , it was very s@@ car@@ y , but I was really s@@ ha@@ king up ."
"But also I was str@@ ong , hol@@ ding myself up ."
"And , of course , by that time , you know how I dre@@ ss — I dre@@ ss from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ j@@ a@@ b ."
"The only thing you could see , my eyes ."
"They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?"
D@@ on &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls ?
"What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Wh@@ ere is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teach@@ ing gir@@ ls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody ."
"We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ or@@ an , H@@ ol@@ y B@@ o@@ ok ."
"And you know , K@@ or@@ an says that if you learn the H@@ ol@@ y B@@ o@@ ok , the woman , they can be a good wi@@ fe , and they can o@@ be@@ y their h@@ us@@ b@@ and . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started spe@@ ak@@ ing P@@ as@@ h@@ to ."
"They tal@@ ked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her al@@ one , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I off@@ er@@ ed them te@@ a again , and they took a si@@ p and they left ."
"B@@ y that time , my st@@ af@@ f p@@ ou@@ red into my of@@ fi@@ ce ."
They were s@@ car@@ ed to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t k@@ ill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
"@@ V@@ er@@ y happy , and I was happy to be ali@@ ve , of course ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ f course , I was happy to be ali@@ ve ."
"But also , as we contin@@ u@@ ously gave tra@@ ining during the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an — of course during the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an there is another story ."
"We went under@@ ground and we provi@@ ded education for 80 sch@@ o@@ ol@@ gir@@ ls , 3@@ ,000 students under@@ ground , and contin@@ u@@ ously we tra@@ ined ."
"W@@ ith the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , we went into the country , and we open@@ ed school after school ."
We open@@ ed women &apos;s learning cen@@ ter .
We contin@@ u@@ ously open@@ ed c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s .
We worked with mo@@ thers and children .
We had re@@ produ@@ ctive health tra@@ ining .
We had all kinds of tra@@ ining that you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up nor@@ th of K@@ ab@@ ul , and all of a su@@ d@@ den , again , I was st@@ opp@@ ed in the middle of the ro@@ ad by 1@@ 9 young men ."
"R@@ if@@ les on their sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , they blo@@ c@@ ked the ro@@ ad ."
"And I told my dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the dri@@ ver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you ."
"What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing . &quot; &quot; They called my name ."
"And by that time , the women are y@@ el@@ ling and scre@@ am@@ ing inside the car ."
"I am very s@@ ha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it ."
"This time , we all are going to be kil@@ led ."
There is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my mind .
"But still , the moment comes , and you take st@@ ren@@ g@@ th from w@@ hatever you believe and w@@ hatever you do ."
It &apos;s in your heart .
"You believe in your wor@@ th , and you can walk on it ."
So I just h@@ old myself on the side of the car .
"My le@@ g was s@@ ha@@ king , and I got outside ."
"And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?"
"They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are ."
We know where you are going .
E@@ very day you go up nor@@ th here and there .
"You tra@@ in women , you te@@ ach them and also you give them an opport@@ unity to have a job ."
"You build their s@@ kil@@ ls . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?"
"What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK ."
"The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just h@@ old the g@@ un and k@@ ill ."
"It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course ."
"So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I wal@@ ked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; T@@ ur@@ n around and go back to the of@@ fi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; A@@ t that time , we only were supp@@ ort@@ ing gir@@ ls ."
"We only had money for women to tra@@ in them , to sen@@ d them to school , and nothing else ."
"B@@ y the time I came to the of@@ fi@@ ce , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were gone ."
They ran away home . No@@ body st@@ ay@@ ed there .
"My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was completely gone ."
"I was s@@ ha@@ ken up , and I s@@ at on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to sol@@ ve this problem ?"
Because we had tra@@ ining going on up nor@@ th already .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of women were there coming to get tra@@ ining .
"So I was si@@ tting there , all of a su@@ d@@ den , at this moment , talking about mo@@ men@@ tum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful don@@ ors called me about a re@@ p@@ ort ."
"And she asked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ ak@@ en@@ a ? &quot; &quot; And I ans@@ wer@@ ed her ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing . &quot; &quot; I tried to co@@ ver ."
"N@@ o matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again ."
"&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
I told her the whole story .
"A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them ."
"You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same rou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back f@@ ur@@ ther , the same young men , standing up there and hol@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and poin@@ ting to us to stop the car ."
So we st@@ opp@@ ed the car .
"I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n one con@@ di@@ tion , that w@@ hatever I say , you ac@@ cept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , y@@ es , they do ."
"So I took them to the mos@@ que , and to make a long story sh@@ ort , I told them I &apos;d give them teach@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers ."
"They learn En@@ gli@@ sh , they learn how to be teach@@ ers , they learn compu@@ ters , and they are my gu@@ ide@@ s ."
"E@@ very area that is un@@ known to us in the m@@ oun@@ tain are@@ as , they go with me . They are a@@ head , and we go ."
And they prote@@ ct us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That tel@@ ls you that education trans@@ for@@ ms people .
"When you edu@@ c@@ ate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gen@@ der equ@@ ality ."
"We cannot only tra@@ in women but for@@ get about the men , because the men are the real people who are gi@@ ving women the har@@ de@@ st time ."
"So we are contin@@ u@@ ously gi@@ ving tra@@ ining to men , and I really believe st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly ."
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
"It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country ."
We were going every@@ where .
"W@@ o@@ men were getting education : la@@ w@@ yer , engine@@ er , te@@ ac@@ her , and we were going from house to house ."
We never lo@@ c@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But you know what happened to my country .
"T@@ o@@ day , people cannot walk out of their do@@ or without se@@ cur@@ ity issu@@ es ."
But we want the same Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
"T@@ o@@ day , the women of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan are working very , very hard ."
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ ining to be la@@ w@@ yer@@ s .
"So it is so wonderful to see people like that re@@ ach their comple@@ te pot@@ ential , and all of this is going to happen ."
"I want to share this with you , because of love , because of comp@@ as@@ sion , and because of tru@@ st and hon@@ est@@ y ."
"If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ compli@@ sh ."
"We have one po@@ et , Ma@@ w@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī ."
"He said that by having comp@@ as@@ sion and having love , you can con@@ qu@@ er the world ."
"And I tell you , we could ."
"And if we could do it in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world ."
"Th@@ ank you very , very much ."
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
"This is where I live . I live in Ken@@ ya , at the s@@ outh parts of the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my da@@ d &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k ."
"N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k is not f@@ en@@ ced in the s@@ outh w@@ ide@@ ly , which means wil@@ d animals like ze@@ bra@@ s mi@@ gra@@ te out of the par@@ k fre@@ ely ."
"So pre@@ da@@ tors like lions fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ ve@@ sto@@ ck .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was kil@@ led at night , and I just w@@ ok@@ e up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had ."
"My community , the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ i , we believe that we came from he@@ av@@ en with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up ha@@ ting lions so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prote@@ ct our community and the li@@ ve@@ sto@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were kil@@ led in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi .
And I think this is why the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k lions are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ sible for his da@@ d &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fir@@ e , because I thought lions were s@@ car@@ ed of fir@@ e ."
"But I came to real@@ ize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even help@@ ing the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a s@@ car@@ e@@ cro@@ w .
I was trying to tri@@ ck the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing ne@@ ar the co@@ w@@ shed .
"But lions are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the s@@ car@@ e@@ cro@@ w , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he ju@@ mp@@ s in and kil@@ ls the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that lions are af@@ ra@@ id of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ ince I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new radi@@ o , and that day she almost kil@@ led me , but I learned a lot about elec@@ tron@@ ic@@ s . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ ter@@ y , an indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x . It &apos;s a small de@@ vice found in a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps mot@@ or@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . It b@@ lin@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a bro@@ ken fla@@ sh@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the so@@ lar pan@@ el char@@ ges the bat@@ ter@@ y , and the bat@@ ter@@ y supp@@ li@@ es the power to the small indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x . I call it a trans@@ for@@ mer ."
And the indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x makes the li@@ ghts fla@@ sh .
"As you can see , the bul@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts fla@@ sh and tri@@ ck the lions into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ en@@ ced any problem with lions ."
And my neigh@@ bor@@ ing ho@@ mes heard about this idea .
One of them was this gran@@ d@@ mother .
"S@@ he had a lot of her animals being kil@@ led by lions , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the lion li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ ince now , I &apos;ve set up seven ho@@ mes around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over Ken@@ ya for s@@ car@@ ing other pre@@ da@@ tors like h@@ yen@@ as , le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to s@@ care ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inven@@ tion , I was lu@@ ck@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best sch@@ o@@ ols in Ken@@ ya , B@@ ro@@ ok@@ house In@@ ter@@ national S@@ ch@@ ool , and I &apos;m really ex@@ ci@@ ted about this ."
My new school now is coming in and help@@ ing by fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re in@@ st@@ al@@ ling the li@@ ghts to the ho@@ mes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sa@@ van@@ na gr@@ as@@ s@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es f@@ lying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an air@@ c@@ raf@@ t engine@@ er and p@@ il@@ ot when I grow up .
"I used to ha@@ te lions , but now because my inven@@ tion is sa@@ ving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the lions , we are able to st@@ ay with the lions without any con@@ fli@@ ct ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , th@@ ank you very much ."
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : You have no idea how ex@@ c@@ iting it is to hear a story like y@@ ours .

"It was my love for technology that s@@ par@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous D@@ ish@@ es . &quot; &quot; There was a vir@@ us on my computer , and I was trying to get ri@@ d of it , and all of a su@@ d@@ den , I just thought , what if vir@@ uses have their own little world inside the computer ?"
M@@ ay@@ be a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant where they me@@ et up and do vir@@ us@@ y things ?
"And th@@ us , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous D@@ ish@@ es &quot; &quot; was born ."
"A@@ t four years old , my da@@ d sho@@ wed me how to take ap@@ art a computer and put it back together again ."
That started my love for technology .
"I built my first we@@ b@@ site myself in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m learning J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt and P@@ y@@ th@@ on ."
I &apos;m also working on an anima@@ ted ser@@ ies called &quot; &quot; The P@@ ol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about be@@ es and other pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
"If plan@@ ts ar@@ en &apos;t pol@@ lin@@ ated by the pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors , then all cre@@ atu@@ res , inclu@@ ding ourselves , that de@@ p@@ end on these plan@@ ts , would star@@ ve ."
So I decided to take these co@@ ol cre@@ atu@@ res and make a su@@ per@@ her@@ o team .
( Applause ) ( F@@ oo@@ t sto@@ mp ) ( Mu@@ sic ) ( Ro@@ ar ) P@@ ol@@ lin@@ at@@ or : De@@ for@@ est@@ sa@@ ur@@ us ! I should have known !
I need to call on the rest of the P@@ ol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors !
"( Mu@@ sic ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my anima@@ tions start with ideas , but what are ideas ?"
I@@ de@@ as can s@@ par@@ k a mo@@ vement .
I@@ de@@ as are opport@@ uni@@ ties and inno@@ v@@ ation .
I@@ de@@ as tru@@ ly are what make the world go r@@ ound .
"If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we w@@ ouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medi@@ cine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives ."
"A@@ t e@@ ight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called M@@ aya &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my non@@ prof@@ it , M@@ aya &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ lan@@ et ."
( Laughter ) And I make e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly c@@ lo@@ thing and ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sor@@ ies .
"I &apos;m 1@@ 3 now , and al@@ though I started my business in 200@@ 8 , my arti@@ stic jour@@ ney started way before then ."
"I was gre@@ at@@ ly inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by art , and I wanted to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate it in everything I did , even my business ."
"I would find different f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cs around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a s@@ car@@ f or a h@@ at , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for desig@@ ns ."
"I no@@ tic@@ ed when I wor@@ e my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really cu@@ te . Wh@@ ere can I get one ? &quot;"
"And I thought , I can start my own business ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any business plan@@ s at only e@@ ight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were sa@@ fe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
"My mo@@ m ta@@ u@@ ght me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would sit and make little he@@ ad@@ ban@@ ds out of ri@@ b@@ bon , and I would wr@@ ite down the na@@ mes and the pri@@ ce of each ite@@ m ."
"I started making more ite@@ ms like ha@@ ts , s@@ car@@ ves and ba@@ gs ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my ite@@ ms began sel@@ ling all over the world , and I had cu@@ sto@@ mers in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , I@@ tal@@ y , Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , C@@ an@@ ada and more ."
"Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like b@@ ran@@ ding and mark@@ et@@ ing , st@@ ay@@ ing en@@ ga@@ ged with my cu@@ sto@@ mers , and seeing what s@@ old the most and the least ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my business really started to take off ."
"Th@@ en one day , F@@ or@@ be@@ s ma@@ gaz@@ ine con@@ tac@@ ted me when I was 10 years old ."
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ ature me and my company in their ar@@ tic@@ le .
"Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly ?"
I &apos;ve had a pas@@ sion for prote@@ cting the environment and its cre@@ atu@@ res since I was little .
My parents ta@@ u@@ ght me at an early age about gi@@ ving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
"I heard about how the dy@@ es in some c@@ lo@@ thing or the process of even making the ite@@ ms was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I disco@@ vered that even after d@@ ye@@ ing has being comple@@ ted , there is a was@@ te issu@@ e that gi@@ ves a ne@@ ga@@ tive imp@@ act on the environment ."
"For example , the gr@@ in@@ ding of materi@@ als , or the du@@ mp@@ ing of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der materi@@ als ."
"These ac@@ tions can pol@@ lu@@ te the air , making it to@@ x@@ ic to any@@ one or anything that in@@ hal@@ es it ."
"So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my ite@@ ms had to be e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly , and 10 to 20 percent of the prof@@ its I made went to local and global char@@ i@@ ties and environ@@ mental organiz@@ ations ."
"( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wa@@ ve of en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ s that not only se@@ eks to have a suc@@ cess@@ ful business , but also a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able future ."
I feel that I can me@@ et the needs of my cu@@ sto@@ mers without com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ing the ability of future gener@@ ations to live in a gre@@ en@@ er to@@ mor@@ row .
"We live in a big , di@@ verse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more pas@@ sion@@ ate to sa@@ ve it ."
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your he@@ ads about the things that are happening in our world .
"It takes to get it through your he@@ ar@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when mo@@ ve@@ ments are s@@ par@@ ked ."
"That is when opport@@ uni@@ ties and inno@@ v@@ ation are created , and that is why ideas come to life ."
"Th@@ ank you , and pe@@ ace and b@@ le@@ s@@ sin@@ gs ."
"( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : So , you heard M@@ aya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredi@@ ble woman . Wh@@ ere are they ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , M@@ r. and M@@ r@@ s@@ . P@@ en@@ n . W@@ ould you just — A@@ h !@@ "
( Applause )
"You know , one of the in@@ ten@@ se ple@@ as@@ u@@ res of tra@@ vel and one of the deli@@ ghts of e@@ th@@ no@@ grap@@ hi@@ c research is the opport@@ unity to live a@@ mon@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the w@@ ind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in , tas@@ te it in the bit@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts ."
"@@ Ju@@ st to know that J@@ a@@ gu@@ ar s@@ ha@@ man@@ s still jour@@ ney be@@ yon@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still re@@ son@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ aya , the Bu@@ d@@ d@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the cen@@ tra@@ l re@@ ve@@ lation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absolu@@ te sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it suc@@ cess@@ ful@@ ly , many gener@@ ations ago ."
"And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves ."
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation ri@@ tes .
"We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ para@@ tion of death , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t surpri@@ se us that we all sing , we all dan@@ ce , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ que ca@@ den@@ ce of the son@@ g , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce in every culture ."
"And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut de@@ ser@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ ya , the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a c@@ ara@@ van@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the Sa@@ har@@ a — this is in@@ ci@@ den@@ t@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ ve@@ led into the de@@ ser@@ t with a mon@@ th ago — or inde@@ ed a ya@@ k her@@ der in the s@@ l@@ op@@ es of Q@@ om@@ olan@@ g@@ ma , E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss mother of the world ."
"A@@ ll of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ en@@ ting yourself in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope ."
"Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual life and cul@@ tu@@ ral life that en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the wel@@ l-@@ being of the planet as inde@@ ed is the bi@@ ological we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here ."
"And you might think of this cul@@ tu@@ ral we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , and you might def@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ a@@ ms , my@@ ths , ideas , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tions , in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions b@@ rought into being by the human ima@@ gin@@ ation since the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
The e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here is human@@ ity &apos;s great le@@ g@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive species .
"And just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been sever@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here — and , if anything , at a far gre@@ at@@ er rate ."
"N@@ o bi@@ ologi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are sug@@ gest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most ap@@ o@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic s@@ cen@@ ar@@ i@@ o in the real@@ m of bi@@ ological di@@ versity — s@@ car@@ ce@@ ly appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic s@@ cen@@ ar@@ i@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tu@@ ral di@@ versity ."
"And the great indi@@ cat@@ or of that , of course , is language los@@ s ."
"When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ a@@ ges sp@@ ok@@ en on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical ru@@ les ."
A language is a fla@@ sh of the human sp@@ iri@@ t .
It &apos;s a ve@@ hi@@ cle through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the materi@@ al world .
"E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth for@@ est of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ec@@ osy@@ ste@@ m of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual possi@@ bili@@ ties ."
"And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ a@@ ges , as we sit here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , ful@@ ly half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being ta@@ u@@ ght to ba@@ bi@@ es , which means , effe@@ cti@@ vely , un@@ less something changes , they &apos;re already de@@ ad ."
"What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to spe@@ ak your language , to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ dom of the an@@ ce@@ stor@@ s or anti@@ cip@@ ate the pro@@ mi@@ se of the children ?"
"And yet , that d@@ read@@ ful f@@ ate is inde@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two we@@ eks , because every two we@@ eks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ la@@ b@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent ton@@ gue ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be better , w@@ ouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ ok@@ e one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ ba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ an@@ ton@@ ese ."
Let &apos;s make it K@@ o@@ gi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ ak your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , a bri@@ ef jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , to try to be@@ gin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"T@@ ake , for example , this child of a B@@ aras@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ maz@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of sa@@ cre@@ d s@@ n@@ ak@@ es ."
"Now , this is a people who co@@ g@@ ni@@ ti@@ vely do not di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ ish the col@@ or b@@ lue from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ a@@ ven@@ s is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people de@@ p@@ end ."
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; &quot; lin@@ gu@@ isti@@ c ex@@ o@@ ga@@ my : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ ak@@ s a different language .
"And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ou@@ ses , where there are six or seven langu@@ a@@ ges sp@@ ok@@ en because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ing a language ."
They simply list@@ en and then be@@ gin to spe@@ ak .
"O@@ r , one of the most fas@@ cin@@ ating tri@@ be@@ s I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ as@@ ter@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing people first con@@ tac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8 ."
"In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies at@@ temp@@ ted con@@ t@@ act and made a cri@@ tical mi@@ st@@ ake ."
"They dro@@ pp@@ ed from the air 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ s@@ y photo@@ graph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ en@@ dly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never seen anything tw@@ o-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al in their lives ."
"They pic@@ ked up these photo@@ graph@@ s from the for@@ est flo@@ or , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and con@@ clu@@ ded that these were cal@@ ling car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to death ."
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ared each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ aring each other .
"We tra@@ ced gene@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back e@@ ight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stan@@ ces of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him any@@ way . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous knowle@@ dge of the for@@ est that was as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing ."
Th@@ e@@ ir hun@@ ters could s@@ me@@ ll anima@@ l ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment when I was asked by my profes@@ s@@ or at Har@@ var@@ d if I was interested in going down to Ha@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tra@@ ting the se@@ cre@@ t soci@@ e@@ ties which were the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s st@@ ren@@ g@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es ."
"In order to make sense out of sen@@ sa@@ tion , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ ith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t ."
"O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a comple@@ x met@@ ap@@ h@@ ysi@@ cal wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great reli@@ gi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?"
"@@ Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , I@@ sla@@ m , Bu@@ d@@ d@@ his@@ m , Ju@@ da@@ ism , w@@ hatever ."
"There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa had no reli@@ gi@@ ous beli@@ ef@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ sti@@ l@@ lation of these very pro@@ found reli@@ gi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gi@@ c Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very er@@ a ."
"But , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad ."
"So , the living give bir@@ th to the sp@@ ir@@ its ."
"The sp@@ ir@@ its can be inv@@ ok@@ ed from ben@@ e@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ at@@ er , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce to mo@@ men@@ tar@@ ily dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d ."
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; &quot; You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ ak about God .
"We dan@@ ce in the te@@ mple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ ses@@ sed , you are taken by the sp@@ iri@@ t — how can you be har@@ med ?"
"So you see these as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tran@@ ce han@@ d@@ ling bur@@ ning e@@ mb@@ ers with imp@@ unity , a rather as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to af@@ fect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the state of extre@@ me ex@@ c@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ o@@ gi of the S@@ i@@ er@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ada de San@@ ta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ olo@@ m@@ bi@@ a ."
"D@@ es@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent T@@ air@@ ona ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion which once car@@ pe@@ ted the Car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in of C@@ olo@@ m@@ bi@@ a , in the w@@ ake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ola@@ ted v@@ ol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars ab@@ o@@ ve the Car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in ."
"In a blo@@ od@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"T@@ o this day , they re@@ ma@@ in ru@@ led by a rit@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od is rather extra@@ ordin@@ ary ."
"The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , sequ@@ e@@ ster@@ ed in a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of d@@ ark@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the bas@@ e of gla@@ ci@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ o@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to mi@@ mic the n@@ ine months of ge@@ st@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wo@@ m@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wo@@ m@@ b of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tu@@ ra@@ ted into the val@@ u@@ es of their society , val@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ posi@@ tion that their pra@@ yer@@ s and their pra@@ yer@@ s al@@ one ma@@ in@@ tain the cos@@ mic — or we might say the ec@@ ological — b@@ alan@@ ce ."
"And at the end of this amazing in@@ iti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ d@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ ri@@ se . And in that c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un begin@@ s to ba@@ the the s@@ l@@ op@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beautiful lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ stra@@ ct is a@@ ff@@ ir@@ med in st@@ un@@ ning g@@ l@@ ory . And the pri@@ est ste@@ ps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you ."
"It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prote@@ ct . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ sible for de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying the world ."
"Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion be@@ comes very important ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e , we e@@ ither inv@@ ok@@ e R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ va@@ ge , &quot; &quot; which is an idea ra@@ ci@@ st in its simp@@ li@@ city , or al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ vely , we inv@@ ok@@ e Th@@ or@@ e@@ a@@ u and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ ither sen@@ ti@@ mental n@@ or we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for e@@ ither in the malar@@ i@@ al s@@ wa@@ mp@@ s of the A@@ s@@ ma@@ t or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ be@@ t , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , through time and rit@@ ual , for@@ ged a tradi@@ tional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ sci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ a@@ the@@ d into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ i@@ sed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ tain is an Ap@@ u sp@@ iri@@ t that will dire@@ ct his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a prof@@ oun@@ dly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that resour@@ ce or that place than a young k@@ id from M@@ on@@ tan@@ a ra@@ i@@ sed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ tain is a p@@ ile of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ iri@@ t or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was ra@@ i@@ sed in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh C@@ olu@@ m@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ est@@ s ex@@ is@@ ted to be cut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends a@@ mon@@ g@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ est@@ s were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ ok@@ ed Be@@ ak of He@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the nor@@ th end of the world , sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to en@@ ga@@ ge during their H@@ ama@@ t@@ sa in@@ iti@@ ation ."
"Now , if you be@@ gin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different re@@ ali@@ ties , you could be@@ gin to understand some of their extra@@ ordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . T@@ ake this plan@@ t here ."
It &apos;s a photo@@ grap@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ maz@@ on just last Ap@@ ri@@ l .
"This is ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ para@@ tion of the s@@ ha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
"What makes ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca fas@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er p@@ har@@ ma@@ c@@ ological pot@@ ential of this pre@@ para@@ tion , but the e@@ labor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sour@@ ces : on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a ser@@ ies of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic — to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is rather to have sort of b@@ lue haz@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness — but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ di@@ s ."
"This plan@@ t had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine ."
"If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ o@@ ma@@ mi blo@@ wing that s@@ n@@ u@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine ."
T@@ o have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pain@@ tin@@ gs and lan@@ ding on a se@@ a of electri@@ city .

"In fact , I used to ar@@ gue with my profes@@ s@@ or , Ri@@ ch@@ ard E@@ van S@@ h@@ ul@@ tes — who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ede@@ li@@ c er@@ a with his disco@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ o@@ ms in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — I used to ar@@ gue that you couldn &apos;t cla@@ s@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es as hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effe@@ cts there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ id@@ ase ."
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with some other chemi@@ cal that den@@ atu@@ res the M@@ A@@ O .
"Now , the fas@@ cin@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tors of the pre@@ ci@@ se sort ne@@ cess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine . So you ask yourself a question ."
"H@@ ow , in a f@@ lor@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar plan@@ ts , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ rela@@ ted plan@@ ts that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bi@@ o@@ chemi@@ cal ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ at@@ er than the su@@ m of the parts ?"
"Well , we use that great e@@ up@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less ."
"But you ask the In@@ di@@ ans , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plan@@ ts talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?"
"This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties of ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , all of which they di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ ish a great di@@ stance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our eye as one species ."
"And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ on@@ omy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plan@@ ts ."
"I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it sin@@ gs to you in a different key ."
"Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at Har@@ var@@ d , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting sta@@ men@@ s .

All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ stan@@ tly been en@@ ga@@ ged in a dan@@ ce with new possi@@ bili@@ ties of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x In@@ di@@ ans did not stop being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American st@@ opp@@ ed being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ gy .

And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the ground level .

"One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ mb@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gre@@ s@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard la@@ b@@ or ."
"The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive sp@@ iri@@ t of the people is something to beh@@ old ."

"Now , you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the c@@ old ; they took ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge of it ."

I realized that this was a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause )
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less cir@@ cu@@ lation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ c@@ les ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The prin@@ cip@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a han@@ dra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ si@@ s@@ ted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sti@@ c@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can cat@@ ch the children fal@@ ling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government off@@ ici@@ al said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a han@@ dra@@ il . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es pop@@ p@@ ing through .
And we were allo@@ wed to call this ro@@ pe as a han@@ dra@@ il .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a tre@@ e .
"The bo@@ y on the b@@ ran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the tre@@ e so he is e@@ ating the tre@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they sit on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so ni@@ ce from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g was@@ h@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ ap@@ s .
"You see with the fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ be@@ s , you want to sp@@ ra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite normal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not was@@ h@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this archi@@ te@@ cture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ o@@ ms .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ stic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ cip@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ en@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tion in cla@@ ss ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not su@@ p@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In su@@ m@@ mer you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never me@@ l@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are su@@ p@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they di@@ vi@@ de cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ o@@ ms .
They are su@@ p@@ posed to help teach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cla@@ ss@@ room .
And a was@@ h@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cla@@ ss@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cla@@ ss@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where San@@ ta C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s .
"This is the anne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ f@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a da@@ u@@ ghter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is s@@ kul@@ l is quite str@@ ong .
He is resi@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to ju@@ mp off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ f@@ fic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of dan@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opport@@ unity we are los@@ ing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the mo@@ vement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 18@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on a@@ verage ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic a@@ bili@@ ties a@@ mon@@ g many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ cip@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
Ju@@ st like sh@@ e@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prote@@ ct them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the at@@ temp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

Here are some ima@@ ges of clu@@ ster@@ s of g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge colle@@ ctions of g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tual gra@@ v@@ ity ."
"So most of the poin@@ ts that you see on the scre@@ en are not individu@@ al st@@ ars , but colle@@ ctions of st@@ ars , or g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies ."
"Now , by sho@@ wing you some of these ima@@ ges , I hope that you will quickly see that g@@ ala@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster@@ s are these beautiful obje@@ cts , but more than that , I think g@@ ala@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster@@ s are my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous , they are surpri@@ sing , and they &apos;re u@@ se@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most mas@@ sive labor@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
"And as labor@@ at@@ or@@ ies , to des@@ cri@@ be g@@ ala@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster@@ s is to des@@ cri@@ be the experim@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular g@@ ala@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster ."
"And , in fact , if you look very car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this clu@@ ster ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ g@@ ling how mas@@ sive these systems can get .
"They are essen@@ ti@@ ally is@@ ola@@ ted systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scal@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
This is in fal@@ se col@@ or .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ ra@@ y light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of these systems is ac@@ ce@@ ler@@ ating par@@ tic@@ les of g@@ as to great spe@@ eds , and great spe@@ eds means great temp@@ er@@ atu@@ res ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but science is a rou@@ gh d@@ raf@@ t ."
"There are many bas@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties about this pla@@ s@@ ma that still con@@ f@@ use us , still p@@ uz@@ z@@ le us , and still p@@ us@@ h our under@@ standing of the physi@@ cs of the very ho@@ t ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expla@@ in this , I need to tell you a very di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
M@@ ost of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of at@@ o@@ ms .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ ost of it is made up of something very , very my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"If you &apos;re a par@@ tic@@ le physi@@ ci@@ st , you want to know what happens when we s@@ mas@@ h things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"T@@ o answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when g@@ ala@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster@@ s col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ ince g@@ ala@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster@@ s are re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive sli@@ ces of the universe , scal@@ ed@@ -@@ down versi@@ ons ."
"They are mos@@ tly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this b@@ lu@@ ish pur@@ ple ."
"What &apos;s happened is a par@@ tic@@ le ac@@ ce@@ ler@@ at@@ or at a huge , huge scale ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ ny ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the physi@@ cs of the very st@@ range .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is cra@@ z@@ y .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything st@@ ran@@ ger I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I th@@ row a b@@ all into the air , I expe@@ ct it to go up ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."

"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale stru@@ cture of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly compli@@ cated ."

"T@@ en years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life ."
The call came from a v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ ian at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o .
"Now , to be cle@@ ar , Nor@@ th American z@@ oo@@ s are sta@@ ff@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans who take out@@ standing care of their anima@@ l pati@@ ents ."
"But oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally , they do re@@ ach into the human medi@@ cal community , particu@@ lar@@ ly for some speci@@ ality con@@ sul@@ tation , and I was one of the lu@@ ck@@ y physi@@ ci@@ ans who was in@@ vi@@ ted in to help ."
"I had a chan@@ ce to ru@@ le out a st@@ ro@@ ke in this chi@@ mp@@ an@@ ze@@ e and make sure that this gor@@ il@@ la didn &apos;t have a tor@@ n a@@ or@@ ta , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate this ma@@ ca@@ w for a heart m@@ ur@@ mu@@ r , make sure that this C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a se@@ a lion &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ di@@ um wasn &apos;t inf@@ la@@ med , and in this picture , I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing to the heart of a lion after a li@@ fe@@ sa@@ ving , col@@ labor@@ a@@ tive pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re with v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans and physi@@ ci@@ ans where we dra@@ ined 7@@ 00 c@@ c &apos;s of f@@ lu@@ id from the sa@@ c in which this lion &apos;s heart was con@@ ta@@ ined ."
"And this pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re , which I have done on many human pati@@ ents , was iden@@ tical , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that ta@@ il ."
"Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter with physi@@ ci@@ ans , dis@@ cu@@ ss@@ ing sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms and dia@@ gn@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for my human pati@@ ents , but some of the time , I was working at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o with v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans , dis@@ cu@@ ss@@ ing sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms and dia@@ gn@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for their anima@@ l pati@@ ents ."
"And oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on r@@ ounds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter and at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very cle@@ ar focu@@ s for me .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans were essen@@ ti@@ ally taking care of the same di@@ sor@@ ders in their anima@@ l and human pati@@ ents : con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart fa@@ il@@ ure , brain tu@@ mor@@ s , le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a , dia@@ be@@ tes , ar@@ th@@ ri@@ ti@@ s , A@@ L@@ S , bre@@ ast cancer , even p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ mes like de@@ pres@@ sion , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , comp@@ ul@@ sions , e@@ ating di@@ sor@@ ders and self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"Now , I &apos;ve got a con@@ f@@ es@@ sion to make ."
"E@@ ven though I stu@@ died comp@@ ara@@ tive physi@@ ology and ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary bi@@ ology as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even wr@@ it@@ ten my sen@@ i@@ or the@@ sis on D@@ ar@@ win@@ ian the@@ ory — learning about the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the di@@ sor@@ ders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed w@@ ak@@ e-@@ up call for me ."
"Wh@@ y had I never , n@@ or had any of my physi@@ ci@@ an friends and col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es wh@@ om I asked , ever atten@@ ded a v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary con@@ fer@@ ence ?"
"For that matter , why was any of this a surpri@@ se ?"
"I mean , look , every single physi@@ ci@@ an ac@@ cep@@ ts some bi@@ ological conne@@ ction between animals and humans ."
E@@ very medi@@ cation that we pres@@ cri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our famili@@ es has first been te@@ s@@ ted on an anima@@ l .
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that w@@ ool gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a plan@@ t ."
"Well , today &apos;s human h@@ osp@@ it@@ als , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als of technology ."
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ ep@@ er reason .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and scienti@@ sts , we ac@@ cept in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tually that our species , H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ en@@ s , is mer@@ ely one species , no more uni@@ que or speci@@ al than any other ."
"But in our he@@ ar@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing to Mo@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the Mars R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ o@@ ok .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ al@@ ism , even as I reco@@ gn@@ ize the scienti@@ f@@ ically is@@ ola@@ ting cost of seeing ourselves as a su@@ peri@@ or species , ap@@ art ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"When I see a human pati@@ ent now , I always ask , what do the anima@@ l do@@ c@@ tors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?"
"And , might I be taking better care of my human pati@@ ent if I saw them as a human anima@@ l pati@@ ent ?"
Here are a few exa@@ mp@@ les of the kind of ex@@ c@@ iting conne@@ ctions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ indu@@ ced heart fa@@ il@@ ure .
"A@@ r@@ ound the year 2@@ 000 , human car@@ di@@ ologi@@ sts &quot; &quot; disco@@ vered &quot; &quot; emo@@ tion@@ ally indu@@ ced heart fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"It was des@@ cri@@ bed in a ga@@ mb@@ ling father who had lost his life &apos;s sav@@ ings with a rol@@ l of the di@@ ce , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter ."
"@@ V@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans had been dia@@ gn@@ os@@ ing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting emo@@ tion@@ ally indu@@ ced sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms in animals ran@@ ging from mon@@ ke@@ ys to fla@@ min@@ go@@ s , from to de@@ er to ra@@ b@@ bi@@ ts , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
How many human lives might have been sa@@ ved if this v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary knowle@@ dge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . do@@ cs and car@@ di@@ ologi@@ sts ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
S@@ ome human pati@@ ents har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome p@@ lu@@ ck out pat@@ ches of ha@@ ir , others actually cut themselves ."
S@@ ome anima@@ l pati@@ ents also har@@ m themselves .
There are bir@@ ds that p@@ lu@@ ck out fe@@ a@@ thers .
There are st@@ al@@ lions that re@@ pe@@ ti@@ ti@@ vely bi@@ te their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans have very speci@@ fic and very effe@@ ctive ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y in their self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ ing animals .
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary knowle@@ dge be put into the hands of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ ists and parents and pati@@ ents stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ?
P@@ os@@ t@@ par@@ tum de@@ pres@@ sion and pos@@ t@@ par@@ tum p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is .
"S@@ ome@@ times , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , some women become de@@ pres@@ sed , and sometimes they become ser@@ i@@ ously de@@ pres@@ sed and even p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic ."
"They may ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some extre@@ me cas@@ es , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans also know that oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally , a m@@ are , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , will ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct the fo@@ al , re@@ f@@ using to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some in@@ stan@@ ces , k@@ ic@@ k the fo@@ al , even to death ."
But v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans have de@@ vi@@ sed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ je@@ ction sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me that inv@@ ol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the m@@ are .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the bon@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this lea@@ ds to ren@@ e@@ wed inter@@ est , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al ."
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family do@@ c@@ tors and pati@@ ents who are stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with pos@@ t@@ par@@ tum de@@ pres@@ sion and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is ?
"Well , de@@ sp@@ ite all of this pro@@ mi@@ se , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately the g@@ ul@@ f between our fiel@@ ds re@@ ma@@ ins large ."
"T@@ o expla@@ in it , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to have to air some dir@@ ty la@@ un@@ dr@@ y ."
S@@ ome physi@@ ci@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about do@@ c@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"I &apos;m talking about den@@ ti@@ sts and op@@ to@@ me@@ tri@@ sts and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ sts , but maybe es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally anima@@ l do@@ c@@ tors ."
"O@@ f course , most physi@@ ci@@ ans don &apos;t real@@ ize that it is har@@ der to get into vet school these days than medi@@ cal school , and that when we go to medi@@ cal school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ en@@ s , but v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in ma@@ m@@ mal@@ s , amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ p@@ ti@@ les , fish and bir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t bla@@ me the v@@ ets for fe@@ eling an@@ no@@ y@@ ed by my profes@@ sion &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion and ig@@ nor@@ ance .
"And through Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , where we bring medi@@ cal sch@@ o@@ ols together with v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary sch@@ o@@ ols for col@@ labor@@ tive dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sions of the sh@@ ared dise@@ ases and di@@ sor@@ ders of anima@@ l and human pati@@ ents ."

"A@@ f@@ ter all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physi@@ ci@@ ans to e@@ mb@@ ra@@ ce our pati@@ ents &apos; and our own anima@@ l nat@@ u@@ res and jo@@ in v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ar@@ i@@ ans in a speci@@ es@@ -@@ sp@@ an@@ ning appro@@ ach to health ."
Thank you .

C@@ an ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c information make you heal@@ thy ?
In 200@@ 1 I got h@@ it by a tra@@ in .
My tra@@ in was a heart at@@ tac@@ k .
"I found myself in a h@@ osp@@ ital in an in@@ ten@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from emer@@ gen@@ cy sur@@ ger@@ y ."
And I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly realized something : that I was completely in the dar@@ k .
"I started as@@ king my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;"
&quot; C@@ ould my do@@ ctor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
"So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the for@@ m@@ ul@@ a for life and good health ."
"G@@ ene@@ tics , li@@ fe@@ st@@ yle and environment ."
"That &apos;s going to sort of con@@ tain our ris@@ ks , and if we man@@ age those ris@@ ks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good heal@@ thy life ."
"Well , I understand the gene@@ tics and li@@ fe@@ st@@ yle part ."
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physi@@ ci@@ ans con@@ stan@@ tly ask me questions about this .
"H@@ a@@ ve you ever had to f@@ ill out those long , le@@ g@@ al@@ -@@ size for@@ ms in your do@@ ctor &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce ?"
"I mean , if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y enough you get to do it more than once , right ?"
"( Laughter ) D@@ o it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your li@@ fe@@ st@@ yle and your family history , your medi@@ cation history , your sur@@ gi@@ cal history , your al@@ ler@@ gy history ... did I for@@ get any history ?"
"But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physi@@ ci@@ ans really get this part of the equ@@ ation ."
"What does that mean , my environment ?"
"Well , it can mean a lot of things ."
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
Wh@@ ile I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you li@@ ved ?
"@@ Ju@@ st think about that , you know , wan@@ der through your life thinking about this ."
And you real@@ ize that you spend it in a vari@@ ety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
"And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an air@@ plan@@ e a good por@@ tion of your time tra@@ v@@ eling some place ."
"So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?"
"And where do you exp@@ ose y@@ ourselves to ris@@ ks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the con@@ clu@@ sion that I spend about 7@@ 5 percent of my time rela@@ ti@@ vely in a small number of places ."
"And I don &apos;t wan@@ der far from that place for a maj@@ or@@ ity of my time , even though I &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ kk@@ er ."
"Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little jour@@ ney here ."
"I started off in S@@ c@@ ran@@ ton , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia ."
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might ha@@ il from nor@@ the@@ as@@ ter@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , but this is where I sp@@ ent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little young l@@ un@@ gs ."
"You know , bre@@ a@@ thing high con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tions here of sul@@ fu@@ r di@@ o@@ x@@ ide , car@@ bon di@@ o@@ x@@ ide and me@@ th@@ an@@ e g@@ as , in un@@ equ@@ al qu@@ anti@@ ties — 1@@ 9 years of this ."
"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those pi@@ les of bur@@ ning , sm@@ ol@@ der@@ ing co@@ al was@@ te look like ."
"So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid@@ -@@ we@@ st ."
"O@@ K , so I en@@ ded up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ vil@@ le , Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ y ."
"Well , I decided to be neigh@@ bor@@ s to a place called R@@ u@@ b@@ ber@@ to@@ wn ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture pla@@ sti@@ cs . They use large qu@@ anti@@ ties ch@@ lor@@ op@@ ren@@ e and ben@@ zen@@ e .
"O@@ kay , I sp@@ ent 25 years , in my mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ age l@@ un@@ gs now , bre@@ a@@ thing vari@@ ous con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tions of that ."
"And on a cle@@ ar day it always looked like this , so you never saw it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
"Th@@ en I decided I had to get really smar@@ t , I would take this job in the W@@ est Co@@ ast ."
And I mo@@ ved to R@@ ed@@ lan@@ ds C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"@@ V@@ er@@ y ni@@ ce , and there my ol@@ der , sen@@ i@@ or l@@ un@@ gs , as I like to call them , I fil@@ led with particu@@ late matter , car@@ bon di@@ o@@ x@@ ide and very high d@@ os@@ es of o@@ z@@ one ."
O@@ kay ? Al@@ most like the high@@ est in the n@@ ation .
"A@@ l@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day ."
"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about ."
"So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?"
"Well , the picture is , there is a huge ga@@ p here ."
The one thing that never happens in my do@@ ctor &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce : They never ask me about my place history .
"N@@ o do@@ ctor , can I remember , ever as@@ king me , &quot; Wh@@ ere have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They ha@@ ven &apos;t asked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the dr@@ in@@ king water that I put in my m@@ outh or the food that I in@@ gest into my sto@@ ma@@ ch .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s mi@@ ss@@ ing .
Lo@@ ok at the kind of data that &apos;s a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend bil@@ lions of dollars inve@@ sting in this kind of research .
"Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ c@@ led the places where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart at@@ tac@@ k I &apos;d been in the right places . R@@ ight ?"
"So , how many people are in the wh@@ ite ?"
How many people in the room have sp@@ ent the maj@@ or@@ ity of their life in the wh@@ ite space ?
An@@ y@@ body ? B@@ o@@ y you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y .
How many have sp@@ ent it in the red places ?
"O@@ h , not so lu@@ ck@@ y ."
There are thousands of these kinds of m@@ ap@@ s that are dis@@ pla@@ y@@ ed in at@@ la@@ ses all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck .
But n@@ one of that &apos;s in my medi@@ cal recor@@ d .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ ours e@@ ither .
"So , here &apos;s my friend P@@ au@@ l ."
"He &apos;s a col@@ lea@@ gue . He allo@@ wed his cell phone to be tra@@ c@@ ked every two hours , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 days out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has sp@@ ent most of his time .
If you really stu@@ died that you might have some clu@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l lik@@ es to do .
An@@ y@@ body got any clu@@ es ? S@@ ki . R@@ ight .
"We can z@@ oo@@ m in here , and we su@@ d@@ den@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really sp@@ ent a maj@@ or@@ ity of his time ."
And all of those black d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic re@@ le@@ ase inven@@ tor@@ ies that are mon@@ it@@ or@@ ed by the E@@ P@@ A .
D@@ id you know that data ex@@ is@@ ted ?
"For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ al@@ ized ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our cell ph@@ ones can now build a place history ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physi@@ ci@@ an would have in front of him and her when we en@@ ter that ex@@ am room instead of just the p@@ ink sli@@ p that said I pa@@ id at the coun@@ ter . R@@ ight ?
This could be my little as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment .
"And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a B@@ ill , I sug@@ gest that maybe you not deci@@ de , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck at night ."
"I &apos;d sug@@ gest that that &apos;s a bad idea B@@ ill , because of this re@@ p@@ ort . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ kay , number one is , we must te@@ ach physi@@ ci@@ ans about the value of ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ medi@@ cine . There are about a half a do@@ z@@ en progra@@ ms in the world right now that are focu@@ sed on this .
And they &apos;re in the early sta@@ ges of develop@@ ment .
"These progra@@ ms need to be supp@@ or@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future do@@ c@@ tors of the world the imp@@ or@@ tan@@ ce of some of the information I &apos;ve sh@@ ared here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars all over the world building an elec@@ tron@@ ic health recor@@ d , we make sure we put a place history inside that medi@@ cal recor@@ d ."
It not only will be important for the physi@@ ci@@ an ; it will be important for the re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers that now will have huge sa@@ mp@@ les to dra@@ w up@@ on .
But it will also be u@@ se@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the deci@@ sion , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ z@@ one cap@@ ital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that deci@@ sion ."
O@@ r I could ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate with my emp@@ lo@@ yer to make that deci@@ sion in the best inter@@ est of myself and my company .
"W@@ ith that , I would like to just say that J@@ ac@@ k L@@ or@@ d said this almost 10 years ago ."
Ju@@ st look at that for a minu@@ te .
"That was what the con@@ clu@@ sion of the D@@ art@@ m@@ outh A@@ t@@ la@@ s of He@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can expla@@ in the ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c vari@@ ations that oc@@ cu@@ r in disease , in il@@ l@@ ness , in wel@@ l@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ a@@ tes ."
That was what he was talking about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right almost a deca@@ de ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us be@@ gin to really se@@ ize this as an opport@@ unity to get this into our medi@@ cal recor@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Ge@@ o@@ graph@@ y always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c information can make both you and me very heal@@ thy . Thank you .

But no a@@ du@@ l@@ ts lik@@ ed the idea .
No a@@ du@@ l@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was ser@@ i@@ ous .
"On@@ ly my friends supp@@ or@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ ra@@ id that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss happ@@ in@@ ess would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fa@@ ir .
So I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to find another cal@@ ling .
No@@ body around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to book@@ s .
I sa@@ tis@@ fied my hun@@ ger for par@@ en@@ tal ad@@ vice from this book by a family of wr@@ it@@ ers and mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ den@@ ce in the F@@ a@@ mily of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my r@@ ole model of an inde@@ pen@@ dent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tradi@@ tion re@@ qui@@ res o@@ be@@ di@@ ence . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ an@@ e E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ aper by the Do@@ z@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was in@@ spi@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; Co@@ mp@@ le@@ te Wor@@ ks of San@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( ak@@ a E@@ ch@@ o Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ es@@ son@@ s F@@ rom H@@ i@@ story &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.@@ S@@ . in 199@@ 5 , so which book@@ s did I read here first ?"
"B@@ o@@ ok@@ s ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The G@@ o@@ od Earth &quot; &quot; is about Ch@@ in@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent for pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da . G@@ ot it .
"The Bi@@ ble is interesting , but st@@ range ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a top@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th com@@ man@@ d@@ ment gave me an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sh@@ all hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of comp@@ ara@@ tive read@@ ing .
It off@@ ers many in@@ si@@ ghts .
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cen@@ ter of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ ri@@ es somebody &apos;s view .
Co@@ mp@@ ara@@ tive read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a stan@@ d@@ ard pra@@ cti@@ ce in the ac@@ ade@@ mic world .
Co@@ mp@@ are and con@@ tr@@ ast gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ars a more comple@@ te under@@ standing of a top@@ ic .
"So I thought , well , if comp@@ ara@@ tive read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in da@@ ily life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing book@@ s in pa@@ ir@@ s .
"For example , it &apos;s through trans@@ lation that I realized &quot; &quot; happ@@ in@@ ess &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ in@@ ese liter@@ ally means &quot; &quot; f@@ ast jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; H@@ u@@ h !@@ "
&quot; &quot; B@@ ri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ in@@ ese liter@@ ally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ ok@@ s have given me a ma@@ gi@@ c p@@ ort@@ al to conne@@ ct with people of the past and the present .
I know I sh@@ all never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
Ha@@ ving a dre@@ am s@@ hat@@ ter@@ ed really is nothing comp@@ ared to what many others have su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed .
E@@ ven a s@@ hat@@ ter@@ ed dre@@ am can do that for you .
"So because of book@@ s , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a pur@@ p@@ ose and a c@@ lar@@ ity , most of the time ."
So may book@@ s be always with you .
Thank you .
"I &apos;m an American , which means , gener@@ ally , I ig@@ nor@@ e fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all un@@ less it inv@@ ol@@ ves guys my size or B@@ run@@ o &apos;s size run@@ ning into each other at extre@@ me@@ ly high spe@@ eds ."
"That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ig@@ nor@@ e fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all for the last couple of we@@ eks ."
"I go on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , there are all these st@@ range words that I &apos;ve never heard before : F@@ I@@ F@@ A , v@@ u@@ v@@ uz@@ el@@ a , we@@ ird j@@ ok@@ es about oc@@ top@@ i ."
"But the one that &apos;s really been sort of st@@ res@@ sing me out , that I ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this ph@@ r@@ ase &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter in the last couple of we@@ eks , you &apos;ve probably seen this ."
It &apos;s been a maj@@ or tr@@ en@@ ding top@@ ic .
"Be@@ ing a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al American , I obvi@@ ously don &apos;t know what the ph@@ r@@ ase means ."
"So I went on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , and I asked some people if they could expla@@ in to me &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And for@@ tun@@ ately , my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends were more than ready to help ."
"They expla@@ ined that the G@@ al@@ va@@ o bir@@ d is a r@@ are and en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed par@@ ro@@ t that &apos;s in ter@@ ri@@ ble , ter@@ ri@@ ble dan@@ ger ."
"In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it ."
"N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : A word about G@@ al@@ va@@ o , a very r@@ are kind of bir@@ d na@@ tive to B@@ raz@@ il ."
"E@@ very year , more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 G@@ al@@ va@@ o bir@@ ds are kil@@ led during Car@@ ni@@ v@@ al para@@ des ."
"E@@ than Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ man : O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , this is a tra@@ gi@@ c si@@ tu@@ ation , and it actually gets wor@@ se ."
"It turns out that , not only is the G@@ al@@ va@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very at@@ tra@@ ctive , u@@ se@@ ful for he@@ ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses , it ev@@ iden@@ tly has certain hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties , which means that there &apos;s a ter@@ ri@@ ble problem with G@@ al@@ va@@ o ab@@ use ."
S@@ ome si@@ ck and tw@@ is@@ ted people have found themselves s@@ n@@ ort@@ ing G@@ al@@ va@@ o .
And it &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ bly en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed .
"The good news about this is that the global community — again , my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends tell me — is p@@ it@@ ching in to help out ."
"It turns out that L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed a new single — actually five or six new sin@@ g@@ les , as ne@@ ar as I can tell — ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends tell me that if I just twe@@ et the ph@@ r@@ ase &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 cen@@ ts will be given to a global ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n to sa@@ ve this r@@ are and beautiful bir@@ d ."
"Now , most of you have fi@@ gu@@ red out that this was a p@@ ran@@ k , and actually a very , very good one ."
"&quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different ."
"In P@@ or@@ tu@@ ge@@ se , it means &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ut your m@@ outh , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it speci@@ f@@ ically re@@ f@@ ers to this guy , G@@ al@@ va@@ o Bu@@ en@@ o , who &apos;s the le@@ ad so@@ c@@ cer com@@ men@@ tat@@ or for Re@@ de G@@ lob@@ o ."
And what I understand from my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends is that this guy is just a cli@@ ch@@ e machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just sp@@ ou@@ ting cli@@ ch@@ e again and again and again .
"So B@@ raz@@ ili@@ ans went to that first mat@@ ch against Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ a , put up this ban@@ ner , started a T@@ wit@@ ter ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n and tried to con@@ v@@ ince the rest of us to twe@@ et the ph@@ r@@ ase : &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so suc@@ cess@@ ful at this that it top@@ p@@ ed T@@ wit@@ ter for two we@@ eks ."
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of le@@ s@@ son@@ s that you can take from this .
"And the first le@@ s@@ son , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong as@@ king people to be ac@@ tive on@@ line , so long as ac@@ tiv@@ ism just means re@@ twe@@ et@@ ing a ph@@ r@@ ase ."
"So as long as ac@@ tiv@@ ism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of B@@ raz@@ ili@@ ans on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
"As far as national re@@ presen@@ tation , 11 percent of B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an inter@@ net us@@ ers are on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.@@ S@@ . or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ex@@ t to Jap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most re@@ presen@@ ted by population ."
"Now if you &apos;re using T@@ wit@@ ter or other social net@@ works , and you didn &apos;t real@@ ize this was a space with a lot of B@@ raz@@ ili@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happens on a social net@@ work is you inter@@ act with the people that you have ch@@ os@@ en to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ ek@@ y , wh@@ ite , American guy , you t@@ end to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ ek@@ y , wh@@ ite , American guys ."
And you don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily have the sense that T@@ wit@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ av@@ ily B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an space .
"It &apos;s also extre@@ me@@ ly surpri@@ sing to many Americ@@ ans , a he@@ av@@ ily Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American space ."
T@@ wit@@ ter re@@ cen@@ tly did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of American T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers are Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American .
That &apos;s about tw@@ ice as high as Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americ@@ ans are re@@ presen@@ ted in the population .
"And again , that was very sho@@ c@@ king to many T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers , but it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be ."
And the reason it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ ren@@ ding T@@ op@@ ic@@ s .
And you t@@ end to find top@@ ic@@ s that are almost enti@@ re@@ ly Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American conver@@ sa@@ tions .
"This was a vis@@ u@@ al@@ iz@@ ation done by F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do V@@ i@@ e@@ g@@ as and Mar@@ tin W@@ atten@@ ber@@ g , two amazing vis@@ u@@ al@@ iz@@ ation desig@@ ners , who looked at a we@@ ek@@ end &apos;s wor@@ th of T@@ wit@@ ter tra@@ f@@ fic and essen@@ ti@@ ally found that a lot of these tr@@ en@@ ding top@@ ic@@ s were basically se@@ gre@@ ga@@ ted conver@@ sa@@ tions — and in ways that you w@@ ouldn &apos;t expe@@ ct ."
"It turns out that oil sp@@ ill is a mos@@ tly wh@@ ite conver@@ sa@@ tion , that co@@ ok@@ out is a mos@@ tly black conver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And what &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were seeing on T@@ wit@@ ter , it &apos;s liter@@ ally a quic@@ k cli@@ ck away ."
"You cli@@ ck on that co@@ ok@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ re@@ ly different conver@@ sa@@ tion with different people parti@@ cip@@ ating in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spe@@ ak@@ ing , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ b@@ les , as my friend E@@ li Par@@ is@@ er cal@@ ls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are si@@ mi@@ lar to the people we already know ."
And we t@@ end not to see that wi@@ der picture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m surpri@@ sed by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the inter@@ net was su@@ p@@ posed to be ."
"If you go back into the early days of the inter@@ net , when cy@@ ber@@ -@@ u@@ top@@ i@@ ans like N@@ ic@@ k Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te were wr@@ iting big book@@ s like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing Di@@ git@@ al , &quot; &quot; the predi@@ ction was that the inter@@ net was going to be an incredi@@ bly powerful for@@ ce to s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tu@@ ral differ@@ ences , to put us all on a common field of one fas@@ hi@@ on or another ."
Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build conne@@ ctions in the world of at@@ o@@ ms .
He &apos;s at a technology con@@ fer@@ ence in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tru@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table ."
And Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te says this is cra@@ z@@ y .
This is the old economy .
"It &apos;s the economy of moving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low at@@ o@@ ms over long di@@ stan@@ ces that &apos;s very difficult to do ."
"We &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ing to the future of bi@@ ts , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s we@@ igh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s tot@@ ally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many cas@@ es at@@ o@@ ms are much more mo@@ bile than bi@@ ts .
"If I walk into a stor@@ e in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to bu@@ y water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in F@@ i@@ j@@ i , shi@@ pp@@ ed at great ex@@ pen@@ se to the United States ."
It &apos;s actually surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly hard for me to see a F@@ i@@ j@@ ian fe@@ ature film .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to list@@ en to F@@ i@@ j@@ ian music .
"It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly difficult for me to get F@@ i@@ j@@ ian news , which is st@@ range , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ mous amount going on in F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
There &apos;s a cou@@ p government . There &apos;s a mili@@ tar@@ y government .
There &apos;s cra@@ ck@@ do@@ w@@ ns on the pre@@ ss .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be pay@@ ing atten@@ tion to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we t@@ end to look a lot at the inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture of glob@@ al@@ iz@@ ation .
We look at the fra@@ me@@ work that makes it possible to live in this conne@@ cted world .
And that &apos;s a fra@@ me@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line rou@@ tes .
It inclu@@ des things like the Internet c@@ ab@@ les .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it looks like the entire world is fla@@ t because everything is a ho@@ p or two away ."
"You can get on a f@@ light in L@@ on@@ don , you can end up in B@@ an@@ g@@ al@@ ore later today ."
"T@@ w@@ o hop@@ s , you &apos;re in Su@@ v@@ a , the cap@@ it@@ ol of F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these net@@ works , you get a very different picture ."
"You start looking at how the global plan@@ e fli@@ ghts move , and you su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disco@@ ver that the world isn &apos;t even close to fla@@ t ."
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly lu@@ mp@@ y .
"There are parts of the world that are very , very well conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s basically a gi@@ ant pa@@ th@@ way in the sk@@ y between L@@ on@@ don and New York .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can wat@@ ch this for , you know , two or three minutes ."
You won &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from S@@ outh America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll disco@@ ver that there are parts of the g@@ lo@@ be that are syste@@ ma@@ tically cut off .
"When we stop looking at the inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture that makes conne@@ ction possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start real@@ iz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last deca@@ de or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more global ."
It &apos;s getting more conne@@ cted .
M@@ ore of problems are global in scale .
M@@ ore of our economi@@ cs is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
"If you wat@@ ched a tele@@ vision bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast in the United States in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , 3@@ 5 to 40 percent of it would have been inter@@ national news on a ni@@ gh@@ tly new bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ."
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very di@@ stor@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a sli@@ de that A@@ li@@ sa M@@ il@@ ler sho@@ wed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TED T@@ al@@ k .
A@@ li@@ sa &apos;s the pre@@ si@@ dent of P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o In@@ ter@@ national .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gra@@ m , which is basically a di@@ stor@@ ted ma@@ p based on what American tele@@ vision news cas@@ ts looked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you di@@ stor@@ t a ma@@ p based on atten@@ tion , the world within American tele@@ vision news is basically re@@ du@@ ced to this gi@@ ant blo@@ ated U.@@ S@@ ."
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve in@@ va@@ ded .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
"And before you con@@ clu@@ de that this is just a fun@@ ction of American T@@ V news — which is d@@ read@@ ful , and I a@@ gre@@ e that it &apos;s d@@ read@@ ful — I &apos;ve been m@@ app@@ ing eli@@ te media like the New York T@@ i@@ mes , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the New York T@@ i@@ mes , you look at other eli@@ te media , what you lar@@ ge@@ ly get are pic@@ tures of very we@@ al@@ thy na@@ tions and the na@@ tions we &apos;ve in@@ va@@ ded ."
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily help@@ ing us all that much .
Here &apos;s a ma@@ p made by Mar@@ k G@@ ra@@ ham who &apos;s down the stre@@ et at the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Internet In@@ stitu@@ te .
A this is a ma@@ p of ar@@ tic@@ les in W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia that have been ge@@ o-@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll no@@ ti@@ ce that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards Nor@@ th America and We@@ ster@@ n Euro@@ pe .
"E@@ ven within W@@ iki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own con@@ t@@ ent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards the place where a lot of the W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia au@@ th@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pic@@ k up your computer when you get out of this ses@@ sion , you could read a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper from India or from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , from C@@ an@@ ada , God for@@ bi@@ d from the U.@@ S@@ ."
You probably won &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line media consu@@ mp@@ tion — in this case , in the top 10 us@@ ers of the inter@@ net — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the news re@@ a@@ der@@ ship is on do@@ me@@ stic news si@@ tes ."
"It &apos;s one of these r@@ are cas@@ es where the U.@@ S@@ . is actually sli@@ gh@@ tly better than &#91; the U.@@ K@@ . &#93; , because we actually like read@@ ing your media , rather than vice ver@@ sa ."
So all of this star@@ ts le@@ ad@@ ing me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I re@@ fer to as ima@@ gin@@ ary cos@@ m@@ op@@ oli@@ tan@@ ism .
We look at the inter@@ net .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de view of the g@@ lo@@ be .
"We oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to a pa@@ ge in Ch@@ in@@ ese , and we deci@@ de that we do in fact have the gre@@ a@@ test technology ever built to conne@@ ct us to the rest of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re che@@ c@@ king B@@ os@@ ton R@@ ed So@@ x s@@ cor@@ es .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed So@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re dis@@ cu@@ ss@@ ing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to sol@@ ve are global in scale and s@@ cop@@ e , they re@@ qu@@ ire global conver@@ sa@@ tions to get to global solu@@ tions ."
This is a problem we have to sol@@ ve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
"For six years , I &apos;ve been han@@ ging out with these guys ."
This is a group called G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ices .
This is a team of blo@@ g@@ gers from around the world .
O@@ ur mis@@ sion was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s media .
We started in 200@@ 4 .
"You might have no@@ tic@@ ed , we ha@@ ven &apos;t done all that well so far ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to sol@@ ve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting le@@ s@@ son@@ s for how we would re@@ w@@ ire if we we wanted to use the we@@ b to have a wi@@ der world ."
The first thing you have to consi@@ der is that there are parts of the world that are dar@@ k sp@@ ots in terms of atten@@ tion .
In this case — the ma@@ p of the world at night by N@@ A@@ S@@ A — they &apos;re dar@@ k liter@@ ally because of la@@ ck of electri@@ city .
And I used to think that a dar@@ k s@@ po@@ t on this ma@@ p basically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more bas@@ ic needs .
"What I &apos;m star@@ ting to real@@ ize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an en@@ or@@ mous amount of work , and you need an en@@ or@@ mous amount of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment ."
"One of those dar@@ k sp@@ ots is M@@ ada@@ g@@ as@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works film than it is actually known for the lo@@ vely people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ ok@@ o C@@ lu@@ b in M@@ ada@@ g@@ as@@ car wer@@ en &apos;t actually con@@ cer@@ ned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much simp@@ ler .
It was a clu@@ b to learn En@@ gli@@ sh and to learn compu@@ ters and the inter@@ net .
but what happened was that M@@ ada@@ g@@ as@@ car went through a viol@@ ent cou@@ p .
M@@ ost inde@@ pen@@ dent media was sh@@ ut down .
"And the high school students who were learning to blo@@ g through F@@ ok@@ o C@@ lu@@ b su@@ d@@ den@@ ly found themselves talking to an inter@@ national audi@@ ence about the de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions , the viol@@ ence , everything that was going on within this country ."
"So a very , very small program desig@@ ned to get people in front of compu@@ ters , publi@@ sh@@ ing their own thou@@ ghts , publi@@ sh@@ ing inde@@ pen@@ dent media , en@@ ded up having a huge imp@@ act on what we know about this country ."
Now the tri@@ ck with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ es@@ sing most people here don &apos;t spe@@ ak M@@ ala@@ g@@ as@@ y .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ es@@ sing that most of you don &apos;t even spe@@ ak Ch@@ in@@ ese — which is sort of sa@@ d if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most re@@ presen@@ ted language on the inter@@ net ."
F@@ ort@@ un@@ ately people are trying to figure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using Google Ch@@ ro@@ me and you go to a Ch@@ in@@ ese language site , you no@@ ti@@ ce this really cu@@ te bo@@ x at the top , which au@@ to@@ ma@@ tically de@@ te@@ cts that the pa@@ ge is in Ch@@ in@@ ese and very quickly at a m@@ ouse cli@@ ck will give you a trans@@ lation of the pa@@ ge ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s a machine trans@@ lation of the pa@@ ge ."
"And while Google is very , very good with some langu@@ a@@ ges , it &apos;s actually pretty d@@ read@@ ful with Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
And the res@@ ul@@ ts can be pretty fun@@ ny .
"What you really want — what I really want , is ev@@ en@@ tually the ability to p@@ us@@ h a bu@@ tt@@ on and have this qu@@ e@@ u@@ ed so a human being can trans@@ late this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Ye@@ ey@@ an .
"And Ye@@ ey@@ an is a group of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting con@@ t@@ ent in the En@@ gli@@ sh language .
"They trans@@ late rou@@ gh@@ ly 100 ar@@ tic@@ les a day from maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , maj@@ or we@@ b@@ si@@ tes ."
They put it on@@ line for free .
"It &apos;s the project of a guy na@@ med Z@@ han@@ g Le@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ has@@ a ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ as@@ ed American media co@@ verage was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start trans@@ la@@ ting , so that people between these countries start under@@ standing each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Ye@@ ey@@ an can line up 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people to trans@@ late the En@@ gli@@ sh inter@@ net into Ch@@ in@@ ese , where &apos;s the En@@ gli@@ sh language Ye@@ ey@@ an ?"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s going after Ch@@ in@@ ese , which now has 4@@ 00 million inter@@ net us@@ ers out there ?"
My gu@@ ess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to trans@@ late from Ch@@ in@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we basically have two strate@@ gi@@ es ."
We use a lot of search .
And search is ter@@ ri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ endi@@ p@@ ity , if you want to st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our ma@@ in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y is to look to our social net@@ works , to look for our friends ."
What are they looking at ? M@@ ay@@ be we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that essen@@ ti@@ ally what you end up getting after a while is the w@@ is@@ dom of the flo@@ ck .
"You end up flo@@ c@@ king with a lot of people who are probably si@@ mi@@ lar to you , who have si@@ mi@@ lar interest@@ s ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flo@@ cks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interest@@ s ."
"T@@ o do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bu@@ mp you out of your flo@@ ck and into another flo@@ ck ."
You need a gu@@ ide .
So this is A@@ mi@@ ra A@@ l H@@ us@@ sa@@ ini . She is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast edi@@ tor for G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ices .
She has one of the har@@ de@@ st j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ ot only does she have to keep our I@@ s@@ ra@@ eli and P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tors from kil@@ ling each other , she has to figure out what is going to inter@@ est you about the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal or@@ bit , and to try to get you to pay atten@@ tion to a story about someone who &apos;s given up s@@ mo@@ king for the mon@@ th of R@@ ama@@ dan , she has to know something about a global audi@@ ence ."
She has to know something about what stories are a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble .
"B@@ as@@ ically , she &apos;s a de@@ e@@ j@@ ay ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a s@@ kil@@ led human cu@@ ra@@ tor who kno@@ ws what materi@@ al is a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble to her , who &apos;s able to list@@ en to the audi@@ ence , and who &apos;s able to make a se@@ le@@ ction and p@@ us@@ h people for@@ ward in one fas@@ hi@@ on or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic process .
I think what &apos;s great about the inter@@ net is that it actually makes it much eas@@ i@@ er for de@@ e@@ j@@ ays to re@@ ach a wi@@ der audi@@ ence .
I know A@@ mi@@ ra .
I can ask her what to read .
"But with the inter@@ net , she &apos;s in a posi@@ tion where she can tell a lot of people what to read ."
"And you can list@@ en to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your we@@ b wi@@ den@@ ed ."
"So once you start wi@@ den@@ ing like this , once you start li@@ gh@@ ting up vo@@ ices in the dar@@ k sp@@ ots , once you start trans@@ la@@ ting , once you start cu@@ ra@@ ting , you end up in some really we@@ ird places ."
"This is an image from pretty much my fav@@ or@@ ite blo@@ g , which is Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blo@@ g that looks at technology in an Africa con@@ text .
"And speci@@ f@@ ically , it &apos;s looking at a bla@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi , who is tur@@ ning the s@@ haf@@ t of a L@@ an@@ dro@@ ver into a c@@ old chi@@ sel ."
"And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;"
"And the tru@@ th is , this guy can probably expla@@ in this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k Her@@ s@@ man . You guys may have seen him around the con@@ fer@@ ence .
He goes by the mon@@ ik@@ er Wh@@ ite Afri@@ can .
"He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ ek , but he &apos;s also Ken@@ yan ; he was born in Su@@ dan , gre@@ w up in Ken@@ ya ."
He is a bri@@ dge figure .
"He is someone who liter@@ ally has feet in both wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afri@@ can technology community , one in the world of the American technology community ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bla@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about inno@@ v@@ ating from con@@ stra@@ int , about looking for in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion based on re@@ using materi@@ als ."
"He kno@@ ws one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate it to another world , both of which he has de@@ ep conne@@ ctions to ."
"These bri@@ dge fi@@ gu@@ res , I &apos;m pretty well con@@ v@@ in@@ ced , are the future of how we try to make the world wi@@ der through using the we@@ b ."
"But the tri@@ ck with bri@@ d@@ ges is , ulti@@ ma@@ tely , you need someone to c@@ ross them ."
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
"So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I su@@ spe@@ ct I would spend my off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my w@@ ounds , en@@ jo@@ ying my house , so on and so for@@ th — possi@@ bly recor@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m ."
"D@@ h@@ ani J@@ ones , who is the middle lin@@ e@@ bac@@ k@@ er for the C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i Ben@@ g@@ als , has a sli@@ gh@@ tly different appro@@ ach to the off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on ."
D@@ h@@ ani has a tele@@ vision show .
"It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ h@@ ani T@@ ac@@ k@@ les the G@@ lo@@ be . &quot; &quot; And every week on this tele@@ vision show , D@@ h@@ ani tra@@ v@@ els to a different n@@ ation of the world ."
He fin@@ ds a local sp@@ ort@@ ing team .
"He tra@@ ins with them for a week , and he pla@@ ys a mat@@ ch with them ."
And his reason for this is not just that he wan@@ ts to ma@@ ster Mu@@ ay T@@ ha@@ i bo@@ x@@ ing .
"It &apos;s because , for him , sp@@ ort is the language that allo@@ ws him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full wi@@ d@@ th and won@@ der of the world ."
F@@ or some of us it might be music . F@@ or some of us it might be food .
F@@ or a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or wr@@ iting .
But there are all these different tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that al@@ low you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The go@@ al of my T@@ al@@ k here is not to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the people in this room to e@@ mb@@ ra@@ ce your x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a .
"My gu@@ ess — given that you &apos;re at a con@@ fer@@ ence called TE@@ D@@ G@@ lob@@ al — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les , whether or not you use that ter@@ m ."
My challenge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the person@@ al deci@@ sion that you want a wi@@ der world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ w@@ ire the systems that we have .
We have to fi@@ x our media .
We have to fi@@ x the inter@@ net . We have to fi@@ x our education .
We have to fi@@ x our im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion poli@@ cy .
"We need to look at ways of cre@@ ating ser@@ endi@@ p@@ ity , of making trans@@ lation per@@ v@@ as@@ ive , and we need to find ways to e@@ mb@@ ra@@ ce and ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te these bri@@ dge fi@@ gu@@ res ."
And we need to figure out how to cul@@ tiv@@ ate x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
"B@@ as@@ ically , there &apos;s a maj@@ or demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c ev@@ ent going on ."
And it may be that pas@@ sing the 50 percent ur@@ b@@ an point is an economic ti@@ pp@@ ing point . So the world now is a ma@@ p of conne@@ c@@ tivity .
It used to be that Par@@ is and L@@ on@@ don and New York were the lar@@ gest cities .
What we have now is the end of the ri@@ se of the W@@ est . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate num@@ bers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , vil@@ la@@ ges of the world are emp@@ t@@ ying out ."
"The question is , why ?"
"And here &apos;s the un@@ ro@@ man@@ tic tru@@ th — and the city air makes you free , they said in R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce Ger@@ many . So some people go to places like S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ tics ru@@ le ."
And these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by po@@ ver@@ ty .
They &apos;re people getting out of po@@ ver@@ ty as f@@ ast as they can .
"They &apos;re the do@@ min@@ ant buil@@ ders and to a large ex@@ t@@ ent , the do@@ min@@ ant desig@@ ners ."
They have ho@@ me@@ -@@ bre@@ wed inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture and vi@@ br@@ ant ur@@ b@@ an life .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of the G@@ D@@ P in India is coming out of M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
"They are con@@ stan@@ tly up@@ gra@@ ding , and in a few cas@@ es , the government hel@@ ps ."
E@@ du@@ cation is the ma@@ in ev@@ ent that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the stre@@ et in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i ?
A@@ l G@@ ore kno@@ ws . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . E@@ very@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of human@@ ity is there . It &apos;s so@@ on going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first p@@ un@@ ch line : cities have de@@ fu@@ sed the population bo@@ m@@ b .
And here &apos;s the second p@@ un@@ ch line .
That &apos;s the news from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . Here it is in per@@ spe@@ ctive .
S@@ t@@ ars have sh@@ ined down on ear@@ th &apos;s life for bil@@ lions of years .
Now we &apos;re sh@@ ining right back up .
Thank you .
"The night before I was he@@ ad@@ ing for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , I was in@@ vi@@ ted to h@@ ost the fin@@ al of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s G@@ ot T@@ al@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i with the 8@@ 0,000 live audi@@ ence in the sta@@ di@@ um ."
G@@ u@@ ess who was the perfor@@ ming gu@@ est ?
S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le .
"And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to S@@ c@@ ot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She san@@ g beauti@@ ful@@ ly , and she even man@@ a@@ ged to say a few words in Ch@@ in@@ ese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hel@@ l@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you , &quot; &quot; that ordin@@ ary stuff ."
It means &quot; &quot; gre@@ en on@@ i@@ on for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
"Because it was a line from our Ch@@ in@@ ese par@@ al@@ le@@ l S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le — a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ some ye@@ ar-@@ old woman , a ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i , who lo@@ ves sin@@ ging We@@ ster@@ n oper@@ a , but she didn &apos;t understand any En@@ gli@@ sh or F@@ ren@@ ch or I@@ tal@@ ian , so she man@@ a@@ ged to f@@ ill in the ly@@ ri@@ cs with ve@@ ge@@ table na@@ mes in Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
"( Laughter ) And the last sen@@ t@@ ence of N@@ es@@ sun D@@ or@@ ma that she was sin@@ ging in the sta@@ di@@ um was &quot; &quot; gre@@ en on@@ i@@ on for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live audi@@ ence san@@ g together ."
That was h@@ il@@ ar@@ i@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess both S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le and this ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i bel@@ on@@ ged to o@@ ther@@ ness .
"They were the least expe@@ cted to be suc@@ cess@@ ful in the business called en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , yet their cou@@ ra@@ ge and tal@@ ent b@@ rought them through ."
And a show and a pla@@ t@@ form gave them the st@@ age to real@@ ize their dre@@ a@@ ms .
"Well , being different is not that difficult ."
We are all different from different per@@ spe@@ cti@@ ves .
"But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view ."
You may have the chan@@ ce to make a difference .
"My gener@@ ation has been very for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness and parti@@ cip@@ ate in the hi@@ stor@@ ic trans@@ formation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years ."
"I remember that in the year of 199@@ 0 , when I was gra@@ du@@ ating from colle@@ ge , I was app@@ lying for a job in the sal@@ es de@@ part@@ ment of the first fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , Gre@@ at W@@ all S@@ her@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ ted by this Jap@@ an@@ ese man@@ a@@ ger for a half an h@@ our , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I su@@ m@@ mon@@ ed my cou@@ ra@@ ge and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , but could you let me know , what actually do you se@@ ll ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a c@@ lue what a sal@@ es de@@ part@@ ment was about in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el ."
That was the first day I set my f@@ oo@@ t in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el .
"A@@ r@@ ound the same time , I was going through an audi@@ tion — the first ever open audi@@ tion by national tele@@ vision in China — with another thou@@ s@@ and colle@@ ge gir@@ ls ."
"The produ@@ cer told us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , inno@@ cent and beautiful f@@ res@@ h face ."
"So when it was my turn , I sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s person@@ ali@@ ties on tele@@ vision always have to be beautiful , s@@ we@@ et , inno@@ cent and , you know , supp@@ or@@ tive ?"
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own vo@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ en@@ ded them .
"But actually , they were im@@ pres@@ sed by my words ."
"And so I was in the second r@@ ound of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , and then the third and the f@@ our@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seven r@@ ounds of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , I was the last one to survi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a national tele@@ vision pri@@ me@@ -@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Ch@@ in@@ ese tele@@ vision that allo@@ wed its h@@ os@@ ts to spe@@ ak out of their own min@@ ds without read@@ ing an appro@@ ved s@@ cri@@ pt ."
( Applause ) And my we@@ ek@@ ly audi@@ ence at that time was between 200 to 3@@ 00 million people .
"Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.@@ S@@ . and C@@ olu@@ m@@ bi@@ a Uni@@ versity to pur@@ su@@ e my pos@@ t@@ gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my car@@ e@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vie@@ wed more than a thou@@ s@@ and people in the past .
"And sometimes I have young people appro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel p@@ rou@@ d of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness the trans@@ formation of the whole country .
I was in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic G@@ a@@ mes .
I was re@@ presen@@ ting the S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i E@@ x@@ p@@ o .
I saw China e@@ mb@@ ra@@ cing the world and vice ver@@ sa .
"But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young gener@@ ation up to ?"
"H@@ ow are they different , and what are the differ@@ ences they are going to make to shap@@ e the future of China , or at large , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about young people through the pla@@ t@@ form of social media .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a gir@@ l called G@@ u@@ o M@@ e@@ i@@ me@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful ."
"S@@ he sho@@ wed off her ex@@ pen@@ sive ba@@ gs , c@@ lo@@ the@@ s and car on her mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g , which is the Ch@@ in@@ ese ver@@ sion of T@@ wit@@ ter ."
And she cla@@ i@@ med to be the gener@@ al man@@ a@@ ger of R@@ ed C@@ ross at the C@@ ha@@ mber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce .
"S@@ he didn &apos;t real@@ ize that she ste@@ pp@@ ed on a sen@@ si@@ tive ner@@ ve and ar@@ ou@@ sed national ques@@ tion@@ ing , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bility of R@@ ed C@@ ross ."
"The con@@ tro@@ ver@@ s@@ y was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ ross had to open a pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence to c@@ lar@@ if@@ y it , and the inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tion is going on ."
"So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that ti@@ tle — probably because she fe@@ els p@@ rou@@ d to be as@@ soci@@ ated with char@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll those ex@@ pen@@ sive ite@@ ms were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her boy@@ friend , who used to be a bo@@ ard me@@ mber in a sub@@ di@@ vision of R@@ ed C@@ ross at C@@ ha@@ mber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very compli@@ cated to expla@@ in .
"But any@@ way , the public still doesn &apos;t bu@@ y it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It sho@@ ws us a gener@@ al mi@@ stru@@ st of government or govern@@ men@@ t-@@ bac@@ ked in@@ stitu@@ tions , which la@@ c@@ ked trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy in the past ."
And also it sho@@ wed us the power and the imp@@ act of social media as mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g .
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ blo@@ g bo@@ o@@ med in the year of 20@@ 10 , with vi@@ si@@ tors d@@ ou@@ b@@ led and time sp@@ ent on it tri@@ p@@ led ."
"S@@ in@@ a@@ .@@ co@@ m , a maj@@ or news p@@ ort@@ al , al@@ one has more than 1@@ 40 million mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g@@ gers ."
"O@@ n T@@ en@@ cent , 200 million ."
"The most popu@@ lar blo@@ g@@ ger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movi@@ e st@@ ar , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ers , or f@@ ans ."
"A@@ b@@ out 80 percent of those mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g@@ gers are young people , under 30 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the tradi@@ tional media is still he@@ av@@ ily con@@ trol@@ led by the government , social media off@@ ers an open@@ ing to let the ste@@ am out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other open@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this open@@ ing is sometimes very str@@ ong , ac@@ tive and even viol@@ ent ."
"So through mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g@@ ging , we are able to understand Ch@@ in@@ ese y@@ outh even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the on@@ e-@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"And because of se@@ le@@ cted ab@@ or@@ tion by famili@@ es who fav@@ or@@ ed boy@@ s to gir@@ ls , now we have en@@ ded up with 30 million more young men than women ."
"That could p@@ ose a pot@@ ential dan@@ ger to the society , but who kno@@ ws ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ al@@ ized world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries ."
M@@ ost of them have fa@@ ir@@ ly good education .
The il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y rate in China a@@ mon@@ g this gener@@ ation is under one percent .
"In cities , 80 percent of kids go to colle@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an a@@ ging China with a population ab@@ o@@ ve 6@@ 5 years old coming up with se@@ ven@@ -@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 ."
"And you know we have the tradi@@ tion that youn@@ ger gener@@ ations supp@@ ort the el@@ ders finan@@ ci@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re si@@ ck ."
So it means young cou@@ p@@ les will have to supp@@ ort four parents who have a life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ a@@ tes are not in sh@@ ort supp@@ ly .
"In ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as , colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ a@@ tes find the star@@ ting s@@ alar@@ y is about 4@@ 00 U.@@ S@@ . dollars a mon@@ th , while the a@@ verage r@@ ent is ab@@ o@@ ve $ 500 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to share space — squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ed in very li@@ mi@@ ted space to sa@@ ve money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of an@@ ts . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed and bu@@ y their ap@@ art@@ ment , they fi@@ gu@@ red out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to af@@ for@@ d their first ap@@ art@@ ment ."
"That ra@@ ti@@ o in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ c@@ ket@@ ing real est@@ ate pri@@ ce ."
"A@@ mon@@ g the 200 million mi@@ gr@@ ant work@@ ers , 60 percent of them are young people ."
They find themselves sort of san@@ d@@ wi@@ ched between the ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as and the ru@@ ral are@@ as .
"M@@ ost of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of bel@@ on@@ ging ."
"They work for longer hours with less in@@ come , less social wel@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to job los@@ ses , sub@@ je@@ ct to inf@@ lation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ bi , or de@@ cl@@ ine of de@@ m@@ and from Euro@@ pe or America for the produ@@ cts they produ@@ ce ."
"L@@ ast year , though , an app@@ al@@ ling in@@ ci@@ dent in a s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing comp@@ ound in China : 1@@ 3 young work@@ ers in their late te@@ en@@ s and early 20@@ s comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de , just one by one like ca@@ using a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease ."
But they died because of all different person@@ al reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ ci@@ dent ar@@ ou@@ sed a huge out@@ c@@ ry from society about the is@@ ola@@ tion , both physi@@ cal and mental , of these mi@@ gr@@ ant work@@ ers ."
"For those who do re@@ turn back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very wel@@ come lo@@ cally , because with the knowle@@ dge , s@@ kil@@ ls and net@@ works they have learned in the cities , with the as@@ si@@ stance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gra@@ de local ag@@ ri@@ culture and create new business in the less develop@@ ed market ."
"So for the past few years , the co@@ as@@ tal are@@ as , they found themselves in a sh@@ orta@@ ge of la@@ b@@ or ."
These dia@@ gra@@ ms show a more gener@@ al social bac@@ k@@ ground .
"The first one is the En@@ gel@@ s co@@ e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent , which expla@@ ins that the cost of da@@ ily ne@@ ce@@ s@@ si@@ ties has dro@@ pp@@ ed its per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge all through the past deca@@ de , in terms of family in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , indi@@ c@@ ating a ris@@ ing living cost ."
The G@@ ini co@@ e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent has already pas@@ sed the dan@@ ger@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in America — sho@@ wing us the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality .
And so you see this whole society getting f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted about los@@ ing some of its mo@@ bility .
"And also , the bit@@ ter@@ ness and even re@@ sen@@ t@@ ment to@@ wards the ri@@ ch and the powerful is quite w@@ ide@@ sp@@ read ."
So any ac@@ cu@@ sa@@ tions of cor@@ rup@@ tion or bac@@ k@@ do@@ or de@@ al@@ ings between au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties or business would ar@@ ouse a social out@@ c@@ ry or even un@@ rest .
"So through some of the h@@ ot@@ test top@@ ic@@ s on mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g@@ ging , we can see what young people care most about ."
So@@ cial ju@@ sti@@ ce and government ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility run@@ s the first in what they de@@ m@@ and .
"For the past deca@@ de or so , a mas@@ sive ur@@ ban@@ iz@@ ation and develop@@ ment have let us wit@@ ness a lot of re@@ por@@ ts on the for@@ ced demo@@ li@@ tion of pri@@ v@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has ar@@ ou@@ sed huge an@@ ger and f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion a@@ mon@@ g our young gener@@ ation .
"S@@ ome@@ times people get kil@@ led , and sometimes people set themselves on fir@@ e to prot@@ est ."
"So when these in@@ ci@@ dents are re@@ por@@ ted more and more fre@@ qu@@ ently on the Internet , people c@@ ry for the government to take ac@@ tions to stop this ."
"So the good news is that ear@@ li@@ er this year , the state coun@@ ci@@ l pas@@ sed a new re@@ gu@@ lation on house re@@ qui@@ si@@ tion and demo@@ li@@ tion and pas@@ sed the right to order for@@ ced demo@@ li@@ tion from local govern@@ ments to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , many other issu@@ es con@@ cer@@ ning public sa@@ f@@ ety is a ho@@ t top@@ ic on the Internet ."
"We heard about pol@@ lu@@ ted air , pol@@ lu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have fak@@ ed be@@ ef ."
"They have sor@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that you b@@ ru@@ sh on a piece of chi@@ c@@ ken or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ ef ."
"And then la@@ tely , people are very con@@ cer@@ ned about co@@ ok@@ ing oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; co@@ ok@@ ing oil from re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant s@@ lo@@ p ."
So all these things have ar@@ ou@@ sed a huge out@@ c@@ ry from the Internet .
"And for@@ tun@@ ately , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more ti@@ me@@ ly and also more fre@@ qu@@ ently to the public con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"Wh@@ ile young people see@@ m to be very sure about their parti@@ cip@@ ation in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their person@@ al life ."
China is so@@ on to pas@@ s the U.@@ S@@ .
as the number one market for lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y b@@ ran@@ ds — that &apos;s not inclu@@ ding the Ch@@ in@@ ese ex@@ pen@@ di@@ tures in Euro@@ pe and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , half of those consu@@ mers are ear@@ ning a s@@ alar@@ y be@@ low 2@@ ,000 U.@@ S@@ . dollars ."
They &apos;re not ri@@ ch at all .
They &apos;re taking those ba@@ gs and c@@ lo@@ the@@ s as a sense of iden@@ ti@@ ty and social st@@ at@@ us .
And this is a gir@@ l exp@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ly saying on a T@@ V da@@ ting show that she would rather c@@ ry in a B@@ M@@ W than sm@@ ile on a bi@@ cy@@ cle .
"But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ fer to sm@@ ile , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a bi@@ cy@@ cle ."
"So in the next picture , you see a very popu@@ lar ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on called &quot; &quot; n@@ ak@@ ed &quot; &quot; we@@ d@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; n@@ ak@@ ed &quot; &quot; mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"It does not mean they will we@@ ar nothing in the we@@ d@@ ding , but it sho@@ ws that these young cou@@ p@@ les are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed without a house , without a car , without a dia@@ mon@@ d r@@ ing and without a we@@ d@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their comm@@ it@@ ment to true love ."
"And also , people are doing good through social media ."
And the first picture sho@@ wed us that a tru@@ ck ca@@ ging 500 ho@@ me@@ less and ki@@ d@@ n@@ app@@ ed do@@ gs for food pro@@ cess@@ ing was sp@@ ot@@ ted and st@@ opp@@ ed on the high@@ way with the whole country wat@@ ching through mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g@@ ging .
"P@@ eople were don@@ ating money , do@@ g food and off@@ ering v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er work to stop that tru@@ ck ."
"And after hours of ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were res@@ cu@@ ed ."
And here also people are help@@ ing to find mi@@ ss@@ ing children .
A father pos@@ ted his son &apos;s picture on@@ to the Internet .
"A@@ f@@ ter thousands of re@@ sen@@ ds in rela@@ y , the child was found , and we wit@@ nes@@ sed the re@@ uni@@ on of the family through mi@@ cro@@ blo@@ g@@ ging ."
So happ@@ in@@ ess is the most popu@@ lar word we have heard through the past two years .
"H@@ app@@ in@@ ess is not only rela@@ ted to person@@ al experi@@ ences and person@@ al val@@ u@@ es , but also , it &apos;s about the environment ."
P@@ eople are thinking about the fol@@ lo@@ wing questions : A@@ re we going to sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce our environment f@@ ur@@ ther to produ@@ ce high@@ er G@@ D@@ P ?
"H@@ ow are we going to per@@ form our social and political re@@ form to keep p@@ ace with economic growth , to keep su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability and sta@@ bility ?"
"And also , how cap@@ able is the system of self-@@ cor@@ re@@ c@@ t@@ ness to keep more people con@@ t@@ ent with all sor@@ ts of fri@@ ction going on at the same time ?"
I gu@@ ess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger gener@@ ation are going to trans@@ form this country while at the same time being trans@@ for@@ med themselves .
Thank you very much .

This back here was my brain cancer .
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it ni@@ ce ?
"( Laughter ) The key ph@@ r@@ ase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; p@@ he@@ w ."
"( Applause ) Ha@@ ving brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , sho@@ c@@ king news for me ."
I knew nothing about cancer .
"In We@@ ster@@ n cul@@ tures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you dis@@ appe@@ ar in a way ."
"Y@@ our life as a comple@@ x human being is re@@ pla@@ ced by medi@@ cal data : Y@@ our ima@@ ges , your exa@@ ms , your la@@ b val@@ u@@ es , a li@@ st of medi@@ cin@@ es ."
And everyone changes as well .
You su@@ d@@ den@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start spe@@ ak@@ ing a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start poin@@ ting their fin@@ gers at your body and your ima@@ ges .
"P@@ eople start chan@@ ging as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; What did the do@@ ctor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ l@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in the me@@ an@@ while , you &apos;re left with questions to which no@@ body gi@@ ves an answer ."
These are the &quot; &quot; C@@ an I ? &quot; &quot; questions : C@@ an I work while I have cancer ?
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be crea@@ tive ?
"And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to de@@ ser@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ fe@@ st@@ yle ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?"
"A@@ re there any other op@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; And , obvi@@ ously , do@@ c@@ tors are the good guys in all these s@@ cen@@ ar@@ i@@ os , because they are very profes@@ sion@@ al and de@@ di@@ cated to cur@@ ing you ."
"But they also are very used to having to deal with pati@@ ents , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes l@@ ose the idea that this is tor@@ ture for you and that you become , liter@@ ally , a pati@@ ent — &quot; pati@@ ent &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;"
"But instead , you &apos;re for@@ ced there to wa@@ it in the hands of a ser@@ ies of very profes@@ sion@@ al st@@ ran@@ gers ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in the h@@ osp@@ ital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-@@ out picture of my cancer and I sp@@ ok@@ e with it ."
"It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common pra@@ cti@@ ce to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A c@@ ure , wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the h@@ osp@@ ital against medi@@ cal ad@@ vice ."
I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to change my relation@@ ship with the cancer and I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dr@@ as@@ tic as a sur@@ ger@@ y .
"I &apos;m an arti@@ st , I use sever@@ al for@@ ms of open@@ -@@ sour@@ ce technologi@@ es and open information in my pra@@ cti@@ ce ."
"So my best be@@ t was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sed by any@@ one ."
"So I created a we@@ b@@ site , which is called L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a , on which I put my medi@@ cal data , on@@ line ."
I actually had to ha@@ ck it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ e@@ ch .
"( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose this word , L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a — L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a in I@@ tal@@ ian means &quot; &quot; the c@@ ure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; c@@ ure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our We@@ ster@@ n cul@@ tures , it means er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ating or re@@ ver@@ sing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ si@@ a , from the M@@ edi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from La@@ tin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"O@@ f course , I was interested in the op@@ in@@ i@@ ons of do@@ c@@ tors and heal@@ th@@ care provi@@ ders , but I was also interested in the c@@ ure of the arti@@ st , of the po@@ et , of the desig@@ ner , of , who kno@@ ws , the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans ."
"I was interested in the social c@@ ure , I was interested in the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological c@@ ure , I was interested in the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual c@@ ure , I was interested in the emo@@ tional c@@ ure , I was interested in any form of c@@ ure ."
"And , it worked ."
The L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a we@@ b@@ site went vi@@ ral .
"I rece@@ i@@ ved lots of media atten@@ tion from I@@ tal@@ y and from ab@@ ro@@ ad and I quickly rece@@ i@@ ved more than 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 con@@ tac@@ ts — e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , social net@@ working — most of them were a sug@@ ge@@ s@@ tion on how to c@@ ure my cancer , but more of them were about how to c@@ ure myself as a full individu@@ al ."
"For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , ima@@ ges , pic@@ tures , art performan@@ ces were produ@@ ced for L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
"For example , here we see Fran@@ ce@@ s@@ ca F@@ ini in her performan@@ ce ."
"O@@ r , as arti@@ st P@@ at@@ ri@@ ck Li@@ ch@@ ty has done : He produ@@ ced a 3@@ D s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ m@@ or and put it on sal@@ e on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ verse ."
"Now you can have my cancer , too !@@ "
"( Laughter ) W@@ hi@@ ch is a ni@@ ce thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer ."
"And this was going on — scienti@@ sts , the tradi@@ tional medi@@ cine exper@@ ts , sever@@ al re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers , do@@ c@@ tors — all conne@@ cted with me to give ad@@ vice ."
"W@@ ith all this information and supp@@ ort , I was able to form a team of sever@@ al neur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ ons , tradi@@ tional do@@ c@@ tors , on@@ c@@ ologi@@ sts , and sever@@ al hun@@ d@@ red v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with wh@@ om I was able to dis@@ cu@@ ss the information I was rece@@ i@@ ving , which is very important ."
"And the cur@@ r@@ ent strate@@ gy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite re@@ mark@@ able for me ."
"@@ &#91; S@@ ur@@ ger@@ y &#93; The fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up M@@ R@@ I@@ s sho@@ wed , lu@@ c@@ kil@@ y , little to no growth of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
"I ch@@ ose the do@@ ctor I wanted to work with , I ch@@ ose the h@@ osp@@ ital I wanted to st@@ ay in , and in the me@@ an@@ while , I was supp@@ or@@ ted by thousands of people , n@@ one of wh@@ om felt p@@ ity for me ."
"E@@ very@@ one felt like they could take an ac@@ tive r@@ ole in help@@ ing me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m f@@ ine , as you can see , pretty f@@ ine ."
"( Applause ) I had ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent news after the sur@@ ger@@ y — I have — I had a very lo@@ w@@ -@@ gra@@ de gli@@ o@@ ma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot ."
I have completely changed my life and my li@@ fe@@ st@@ yle .
E@@ very@@ thing I did was thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful@@ ly desig@@ ned to get me en@@ ga@@ ged .
"U@@ p until the very last few minutes of the sur@@ ger@@ y , which was very in@@ ten@@ se , a ma@@ tri@@ x of elec@@ tro@@ des was im@@ plan@@ ted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of what the brain con@@ tr@@ ols ."
"And right before the oper@@ ation , we were able to dis@@ cu@@ ss the fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of my brain with the do@@ ctor , to understand which ris@@ ks I was run@@ ning into and if there were any I wanted to av@@ o@@ id ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were ."
&#91; O@@ p@@ en &#93; And this open@@ ness was really the fun@@ da@@ mental part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a .
"Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of people sh@@ ared their stories , their experi@@ ences ."
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t u@@ su@@ ally con@@ s@@ ult when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , contin@@ u@@ ous state of trans@@ lation a@@ mon@@ g many different langu@@ a@@ ges , in which science me@@ ets emo@@ tion and con@@ ven@@ tional research me@@ ets tradi@@ tional research ."
&#91; So@@ ci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really en@@ ga@@ ged and conne@@ cted society wh@@ ose wel@@ l@@ ness really de@@ pen@@ ds on the wel@@ l@@ ness of all of its comp@@ on@@ ents .
This global performan@@ ce is my open@@ -@@ sour@@ ce c@@ ure for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a c@@ ure for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
"A big challenge is , how should the i@@ P@@ ads be used , and what app@@ s should we put on the i@@ P@@ ads ?"
H@@ i everybody . So my name is Ma@@ c .
"My job is that I li@@ e to children , but they &apos;re hon@@ est li@@ es ."
"I wr@@ ite children &apos;s book@@ s , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e from P@@ ab@@ l@@ o P@@ ic@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not tru@@ th ."
Ar@@ t is a li@@ e that makes us real@@ ize tru@@ th or at least the tru@@ th that is given us to understand .
"The arti@@ st must know the man@@ ner wh@@ er@@ e@@ by to con@@ v@@ ince others of the tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ness of his li@@ es . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a k@@ id , and I lo@@ ved it , but I had no idea what it me@@ ant ."
"( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , tru@@ th and li@@ es , fic@@ tion and reality ."
So how could I un@@ tan@@ gle this k@@ not@@ ted bun@@ ch of sen@@ ten@@ ces ?
"And I said , I &apos;ve got P@@ o@@ wer@@ P@@ o@@ int . Let &apos;s do a V@@ en@@ n dia@@ gra@@ m ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ th . L@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , bo@@ om ."
"We &apos;ve got tru@@ th and li@@ es and then there &apos;s this little space , the ed@@ ge , in the middle ."
"That li@@ min@@ al space , that &apos;s art ."
All right . V@@ en@@ n dia@@ gra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very help@@ ful e@@ ither .
"The thing that made me understand that quot@@ e and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids ."
I used to be a su@@ m@@ mer ca@@ mp coun@@ sel@@ or .
"I would do it on my su@@ m@@ mers off from colle@@ ge , and I lo@@ ved it ."
It was a sp@@ or@@ ts su@@ m@@ mer ca@@ mp for f@@ our@@ - to si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds .
"I was in char@@ ge of the f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play sp@@ or@@ ts , and ne@@ ither can I@@ ."
"( Laughter ) I play sp@@ or@@ ts at a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old level , so what would happen is the kids would dri@@ b@@ ble around some con@@ es , and then got ho@@ t , and then they would go sit under@@ ne@@ ath the tre@@ e where I was already si@@ tting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life ."
"I would tell them about how , on the we@@ ek@@ ends , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of En@@ g@@ land ."
"And so@@ on , other kids who wer@@ en &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Ma@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t , right ?"
You &apos;re the guy who sp@@ ies for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of En@@ g@@ land . &quot; &quot; And I had been wa@@ iting my whole life for st@@ ran@@ gers to come up and ask me that question .
"In my fan@@ tas@@ y , they were s@@ v@@ el@@ te R@@ us@@ si@@ an women , but , you know , f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in B@@ erke@@ ley , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was famili@@ ar to me and really ex@@ c@@ iting .
"I think the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of this for me — I &apos;ll never for@@ get this — there was this little gir@@ l na@@ med R@@ ile@@ y . She was tin@@ y , and she used to always take out her l@@ un@@ ch every day and she would th@@ row out her f@@ ru@@ it ."
"S@@ he would just take her f@@ ru@@ it , her mo@@ m p@@ ac@@ ked her a me@@ l@@ on every day , and she would just th@@ row it in the i@@ v@@ y and then she would e@@ at f@@ ru@@ it s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks and pu@@ d@@ ding cu@@ ps , and I was like , &quot; &quot; R@@ ile@@ y , you can &apos;t do that , you have to e@@ at the f@@ ru@@ it . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you th@@ row the f@@ ru@@ it in the i@@ v@@ y , pretty so@@ on , it &apos;s going to be over@@ gro@@ wn with me@@ l@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I en@@ ded up telling stories to children and not being a n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion@@ ist for children ."
"And so R@@ ile@@ y was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of ca@@ mp , I got up early and I got a big can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe from the gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e and I hi@@ d it in the i@@ v@@ y , and then at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , I was like , &quot; R@@ ile@@ y , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;"
"And — ( Laughter ) — she went tru@@ d@@ ging through the i@@ v@@ y , and then her eyes just got so wi@@ de , and she poin@@ ted out this me@@ l@@ on that was big@@ ger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and ru@@ shed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why is there a sti@@ ck@@ er on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not th@@ row your sti@@ ck@@ ers in the i@@ v@@ y ."
"P@@ ut them in the tr@@ as@@ h can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And R@@ ile@@ y car@@ ri@@ ed that me@@ l@@ on around with her all day , and she was so p@@ rou@@ d ."
"And R@@ ile@@ y knew she didn &apos;t grow a me@@ l@@ on in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a we@@ ird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"S@@ he was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
"It &apos;s what C@@ ol@@ er@@ id@@ ge called the wil@@ ling su@@ sp@@ en@@ sion of dis@@ beli@@ ef or po@@ e@@ tic fa@@ ith , for those mo@@ ments where a story , no matter how st@@ range , has some se@@ mb@@ lan@@ ce of the tru@@ th , and then you &apos;re able to believe it ."
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"A@@ du@@ l@@ ts can too , and we get there when we read ."
"It &apos;s why in two days , people will be des@@ cen@@ ding on D@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ in to take the wal@@ king t@@ our of B@@ lo@@ om@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses , &quot; &quot; even though n@@ one of that happened ."
"We know these charac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real , but we have real fe@@ el@@ ings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these charac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real ,"
and yet we also know that they are .
"K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more eas@@ ily than a@@ du@@ l@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love wr@@ iting for kids ."
I think kids are the best audi@@ ence for ser@@ i@@ ous liter@@ ary fic@@ tion .
"When I was a k@@ id , I was ob@@ ses@@ sed with se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or no@@ v@@ els , things like &quot; &quot; N@@ ar@@ ni@@ a , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ dro@@ be and go through to a ma@@ gi@@ cal land ."
And I was con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that se@@ cre@@ t do@@ ors really did ex@@ ist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
"I wanted to live and c@@ ross over into that fic@@ tional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s clos@@ et do@@ ors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mo@@ m &apos;s boy@@ friend &apos;s clos@@ et , and there was not a se@@ cre@@ t ma@@ gi@@ cal land there ."
There was some other we@@ ird stuff that I think my mo@@ m should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
"A@@ f@@ ter colle@@ ge , my first job was working behind one of these se@@ cre@@ t do@@ ors ."
This is a place called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a .
"It &apos;s at 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et in the M@@ is@@ sion in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , and when I worked there , there was a publi@@ sh@@ ing company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ed there called M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s , a non@@ prof@@ it wr@@ iting cen@@ ter called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , but then the front of it was a st@@ range sho@@ p ."
"You see , this place was z@@ on@@ ed re@@ ta@@ il , and in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the wr@@ it@@ er who f@@ oun@@ ded it , a wr@@ it@@ er na@@ med Da@@ ve E@@ g@@ gers , to come into compli@@ ance with co@@ de , he said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , I &apos;m just going to build a pi@@ rate supp@@ ly stor@@ e . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wo@@ od ."
There &apos;s dra@@ w@@ ers you can pul@@ l out and get c@@ it@@ ru@@ s so you don &apos;t get s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
"They have e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ches in lots of col@@ ors , because when it &apos;s sp@@ r@@ ing@@ time , pi@@ ra@@ tes want to go wil@@ d ."
You don &apos;t know . B@@ la@@ ck is bor@@ ing . P@@ as@@ te@@ l .
"O@@ r eyes , also in lots of col@@ ors , just gla@@ ss eyes , de@@ pen@@ ding on how you want to deal with that si@@ tu@@ ation ."
"And the stor@@ e , st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly , people came to them and b@@ ou@@ ght things , and they en@@ ded up pay@@ ing the r@@ ent for our tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the qu@@ ality of work you do , kids would come and get in@@ stru@@ ction in wr@@ iting , and when you have to walk this we@@ ird , li@@ min@@ al , fic@@ tional space like this to go do your wr@@ iting , it &apos;s going to af@@ fect the kind of work that you make ."
It &apos;s a se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or that you can walk through .
"So I ran the 8@@ 2@@ 6 in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , and it was my job to build the stor@@ e down there ."
So we have The E@@ ch@@ o Par@@ k T@@ ime T@@ ra@@ vel M@@ art .
O@@ ur fri@@ en@@ dly st@@ af@@ f is ready to help you .
"They &apos;re from all er@@ as , inclu@@ ding just the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very re@@ cent past ."
"There &apos;s our E@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es of the M@@ on@@ th , inclu@@ ding G@@ en@@ gh@@ is K@@ h@@ an , C@@ har@@ les D@@ ic@@ ken@@ s ."
S@@ ome great people have come up through our ran@@ ks .
This is our kind of p@@ har@@ ma@@ cy se@@ ction .
"We have some pat@@ ent medi@@ cin@@ es , C@@ an@@ op@@ ic j@@ ars for your or@@ g@@ ans , communi@@ st so@@ ap that says , &quot; &quot; This is your so@@ ap for the year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) O@@ ur s@@ lu@@ sh@@ y machine bro@@ ke on the open@@ ing night and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
O@@ ur archi@@ te@@ ct was co@@ vered in red sy@@ ru@@ p .
"It looked like he had just m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular archi@@ te@@ ct , and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
It was going to be the high@@ light of our stor@@ e .
"So we just put that sig@@ n on it that said , &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of order . C@@ ome back ye@@ ster@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that en@@ ded up being a better j@@ ok@@ e than s@@ lu@@ shi@@ es , so we just left it there for@@ ever ."
"M@@ am@@ mot@@ h Ch@@ un@@ ks . These things we@@ i@@ gh , like , seven p@@ ounds each ."
B@@ ar@@ bar@@ ian re@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ ent . It &apos;s full of sal@@ ad and pot@@ p@@ our@@ ri — things that bar@@ bar@@ i@@ ans ha@@ te .
De@@ ad langu@@ a@@ ges .
"( Laughter ) Le@@ e@@ ches , nature &apos;s tin@@ y do@@ c@@ tors ."
"And V@@ ik@@ ing O@@ d@@ or@@ ant , which comes in lots of great s@@ cen@@ ts : to@@ en@@ a@@ il@@ s , s@@ we@@ at and r@@ ot@@ ten ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , p@@ y@@ re as@@ h ."
"Because we believe that A@@ x@@ e B@@ o@@ dy S@@ pra@@ y is something that you should only find on the bat@@ t@@ le@@ field , not under your ar@@ ms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emo@@ tion chi@@ ps , so robot@@ s can feel love or fe@@ ar ."
"O@@ ur big@@ gest sel@@ ler is S@@ cha@@ den@@ fre@@ u@@ de , which we did not expe@@ ct ."
( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
"But there &apos;s a non@@ prof@@ it behind it , and kids go through a do@@ or that says &quot; &quot; E@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es On@@ ly &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do ho@@ me@@ work and wr@@ ite stories and make fil@@ ms and this is a book re@@ le@@ ase par@@ ty where kids will read ."
"There &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly that &apos;s publi@@ shed with just wr@@ iting that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have re@@ le@@ ase par@@ ties and they e@@ at cak@@ e and read for their parents and dr@@ ink mil@@ k out of cha@@ mp@@ ag@@ ne gla@@ s@@ ses ."
"And it &apos;s a very speci@@ al space , because it &apos;s this we@@ ird space in the front ."
The j@@ ok@@ e isn &apos;t a j@@ ok@@ e .
"You can &apos;t find the se@@ a@@ ms on the fic@@ tion , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fic@@ tion that &apos;s col@@ on@@ ized the real world ."
I see it as kind of a book in three di@@ men@@ sions .
"There &apos;s a ter@@ m called me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tion , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and me@@ ta &apos;s having a moment now ."
"I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s with no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts like Joh@@ n B@@ ar@@ th and W@@ il@@ li@@ am G@@ ad@@ di@@ s , but it &apos;s been around ."
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ telling itself .
And one me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tive tech@@ ni@@ que is bre@@ ak@@ ing the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s when an ac@@ tor will turn to the audi@@ ence and say , &quot; &quot; I am an ac@@ tor , these are just raf@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly hon@@ est moment , I would ar@@ gue , is in ser@@ vice of the li@@ e , but it &apos;s su@@ p@@ posed to for@@ e@@ ground the arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ality of the fic@@ tion ."
"For me , I kind of pre@@ fer the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"If I &apos;m going to bre@@ ak down the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all , I want fic@@ tion to es@@ cap@@ e and come into the real world ."
I want a book to be a se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or that open@@ s and le@@ ts the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my book@@ s .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ ly T@@ wit@@ ters and his B@@ lue W@@ hale Pro@@ b@@ le@@ m . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a k@@ id who gets a b@@ lue wh@@ al@@ e as a pe@@ t but it &apos;s a p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment and it ru@@ ins his life .
So it &apos;s deli@@ vered over@@ night by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o — very t@@ ough city to own a b@@ lue wh@@ al@@ e in .
"A lot of h@@ il@@ ls , real est@@ ate is at a pre@@ mi@@ um ."
"This market &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y , everybody ."
"But under@@ ne@@ ath the j@@ ac@@ ket is this case , and that &apos;s the co@@ ver under@@ ne@@ ath the book , the j@@ ac@@ ket , and there &apos;s an ad that off@@ ers a free 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day ris@@ k@@ -@@ free tri@@ al for a b@@ lue wh@@ al@@ e ."
And you can just sen@@ d in a self-@@ ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed sta@@ mp@@ ed en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e and we &apos;ll sen@@ d you a wh@@ al@@ e .
And kids do wr@@ ite in .
"So here &apos;s a let@@ ter . It says , &quot; &quot; De@@ ar people , I be@@ t you 10 bu@@ cks you won &apos;t sen@@ d me a b@@ lue wh@@ al@@ e ."
"E@@ li@@ ot G@@ an@@ n@@ on ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what E@@ li@@ ot and the other kids who sen@@ d these in get back is a let@@ ter in very small pr@@ int from a Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an la@@ w fir@@ m — ( Laughter ) — that says that du@@ e to a change in cu@@ sto@@ ms la@@ ws , their wh@@ al@@ e has been hel@@ d up in So@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d , which is a very lo@@ vely f@@ j@@ or@@ d , and then it just kind of tal@@ ks about So@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d and Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an food for a little while . It di@@ gre@@ s@@ ses . ( Laughter )"
But it fin@@ ish@@ es off by saying that your wh@@ al@@ e would love to hear from you .
"He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a messa@@ ge ."
"And when you call and leave him a messa@@ ge , you just , on the out@@ going messa@@ ge , it &apos;s just wh@@ al@@ e s@@ ounds and then a be@@ ep , which actually s@@ ounds a lot like a wh@@ al@@ e sound ."
And they get a picture of their wh@@ al@@ e too .
"So this is R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h , and R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h bel@@ on@@ gs to a k@@ id na@@ med N@@ ic@@ o who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s messa@@ ge ."
This is the first messa@@ ge I ever got from N@@ ic@@ o .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I am your ow@@ ner , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h . H@@ el@@ l@@ o ."
"So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you so@@ on another day . B@@ ye ."
"M@@ a@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t : So N@@ ic@@ o called back , like , an h@@ our later ."
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s messa@@ ges .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you for a long time , but I tal@@ ked to you on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , ye@@ ah , S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , so now I &apos;m cal@@ ling you again to say hel@@ l@@ o and I won@@ der what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again to@@ mor@@ row or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ ye ."
"M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again ."
He &apos;s left over 25 messa@@ ges for R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h over four years .
"You find out all about him and the gran@@ d@@ ma that he lo@@ ves and the gran@@ d@@ ma that he lik@@ es a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the c@@ ros@@ s@@ word p@@ uz@@ z@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more messa@@ ge from N@@ ic@@ o ."
This is the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s messa@@ ge from N@@ ic@@ o .
"@@ &#91; Be@@ ep &#93; ( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h , sor@@ ry I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you in a long time ."
"It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so bu@@ s@@ y because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a wh@@ al@@ e , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m cal@@ ling you to just say , to w@@ ish you a mer@@ ry Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s ."
"So have a ni@@ ce Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s , and b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ ye , R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h . Goo@@ d@@ b@@ ye ."
"M@@ B : I actually got N@@ ic@@ o , I ha@@ dn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a messa@@ ge two days ago ."
"H@@ is vo@@ ice is completely different , but he put his bab@@ ysi@@ t@@ ter on the phone , and she was very ni@@ ce to R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h as well ."
But N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s the best read@@ er I could hope for .
I would want any@@ one I was wr@@ iting for to be in that place emo@@ tion@@ ally with the things that I create .
"I feel lu@@ ck@@ y . K@@ i@@ ds like N@@ ic@@ o are the best re@@ a@@ ders , and they de@@ ser@@ ve the best stories we can give them ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) Thank you . O@@ o@@ h , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; P@@ he@@ w , p@@ he@@ w , cal@@ m down .

"And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( V@@ v@@ v@@ w@@ ow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;"
"Well , what I &apos;m doing is con@@ trol@@ ling the p@@ it@@ ch with my left hand ."
"S@@ e@@ e , the clos@@ er I get to this an@@ ten@@ na , the high@@ er the n@@ ote gets — ( P@@ orta@@ men@@ to ) — and you can get it really low ."
"And with this hand I &apos;m con@@ trol@@ ling the v@@ olu@@ me , so the f@@ ur@@ ther away my right hand gets , the l@@ ou@@ der it gets ."
"( T@@ ones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re con@@ trol@@ ling p@@ it@@ ch and v@@ olu@@ me and kind of trying to create the il@@ lu@@ sion that you &apos;re doing se@@ par@@ ate not@@ es , when really it &apos;s contin@@ u@@ ously going ..."
"( F@@ l@@ ou@@ ris@@ h ... Be@@ ep ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times I star@@ tle myself : I &apos;ll for@@ get that I have it on , and I &apos;ll le@@ an over to pic@@ k up something , and then it goes like — ( B@@ li@@ p ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a fun@@ ny sound effe@@ ct that fol@@ lo@@ ws you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )"
"M@@ ay@@ be we &apos;ll go into the next tun@@ e , because I tot@@ ally lost where this is going ."
"We &apos;re going to do a son@@ g by Da@@ vi@@ d M@@ as@@ h called &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en : the Wor@@ ds A@@ re G@@ one , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me af@@ ter@@ wards if I can rela@@ x ."
"( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are com@@ mon@@ ly asked ; there are so many ."
"And ... Well , I gu@@ ess I could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ e@@ min ."
"It was inven@@ ted around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the inven@@ tor , L@@ é@@ on Th@@ er@@ e@@ min — he also was a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an be@@ si@@ des an inven@@ tor — he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ e@@ min , I think , when he was working on some sh@@ or@@ tw@@ a@@ ve radi@@ os ."
"And there &apos;d be that sound in the sig@@ n@@ al — it &apos;s like ( S@@ cre@@ e@@ ching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an in@@ stru@@ ment , because there are p@@ it@@ ches in it . &quot; &quot; And so some@@ how through develop@@ ing that , he ev@@ en@@ tually came to make the ther@@ e@@ min the way it is now ."
"And a lot of times , even kids no@@ wa@@ days , they &apos;ll make re@@ fer@@ ence to a ther@@ e@@ min by going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ oo@@ -@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the sci@@ -@@ f@@ i hor@@ ro@@ r movi@@ es , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( W@@ oo@@ -@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a fun@@ ny , go@@ of@@ y sound to do ."
"And sometimes if I have too much co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , then my vi@@ bra@@ to gets out of hand ."
You &apos;re really sen@@ si@@ tive to your body and its fun@@ ctions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to st@@ ay so still if you want to have the most control .
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of the b@@ alan@@ cing act ear@@ li@@ er on — what M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el was doing — because you &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting so hard to keep the b@@ alan@@ ce with what you &apos;re pla@@ ying with and st@@ ay in tun@@ e , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focu@@ s so much on being in tun@@ e all the time ; you want to be fe@@ eling the music ."
"And then also , you &apos;re trying to st@@ ay very , very , very still because little mo@@ ve@@ ments with other parts of your body will af@@ fect the p@@ it@@ ch , or sometimes if you &apos;re hol@@ ding a low n@@ ote — ( T@@ one ris@@ ing out of key ) — and bre@@ a@@ thing will make it ..."
( Laughter ) If I pas@@ s out on the next son@@ g ... ( Laughter )
"I think of it almost like like a yo@@ g@@ a in@@ stru@@ ment because it makes you so aw@@ are of every little cra@@ z@@ y thing your body is doing , or just aw@@ are of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re pla@@ ying ; you don &apos;t want to have any su@@ d@@ den mo@@ ve@@ ments ."
"And if I go to a clu@@ b and play a gi@@ g , people are like , &quot; Here , have some dr@@ in@@ ks on us ! &quot;"
"And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on so@@ on ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Te@@ et@@ ering t@@ ones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does re@@ fle@@ ct the mo@@ od that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ..."
"@@ it &apos;s si@@ mi@@ lar to being a vo@@ cal@@ ist , ex@@ cept instead of it coming out of your th@@ ro@@ at , you &apos;re con@@ trol@@ ling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of re@@ fer@@ ence ; you &apos;re always re@@ lying on your e@@ ars and ad@@ ju@@ sting con@@ stan@@ tly ."
"You just have to always ad@@ just to what &apos;s happening and real@@ ize you &apos;ll have bu@@ m@@ mer not@@ es come here and there and list@@ en to it , ad@@ just it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too ti@@ ed up and go cra@@ z@@ y . L@@ ik@@ e me ."
I think we will play another tun@@ e now .

It has been 1@@ 2@@ 8 years since the last country in the world ab@@ oli@@ shed sla@@ very and 5@@ 3 years since Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ced his &quot; &quot; I Ha@@ ve A D@@ re@@ am &quot; &quot; spe@@ e@@ ch .
"But we still live in a world where the col@@ or of our sk@@ in not only gi@@ ves a first im@@ pres@@ sion , but a la@@ sting one that re@@ ma@@ ins ."
I was born in a family full of col@@ ors .
My father is the son of a ma@@ id from wh@@ om he in@@ her@@ i@@ ted an in@@ ten@@ se dar@@ k cho@@ co@@ late t@@ one .
He was ad@@ op@@ ted by those who I know as my gran@@ d@@ parents .
"The ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch , my gran@@ d@@ ma , has a por@@ ce@@ la@@ in sk@@ in and c@@ ot@@ ton@@ -@@ like ha@@ ir ."
"My gran@@ d@@ p@@ a was some@@ where between a van@@ il@@ la and stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry yo@@ g@@ ur@@ t t@@ one , like my un@@ cle and my cou@@ sin ."
"My mother is a cin@@ na@@ mon@@ -@@ sk@@ in da@@ u@@ ghter of a na@@ tive B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an , with a p@@ in@@ ch of haz@@ el and hon@@ ey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mi@@ x of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e with mil@@ k , but with a lot of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ."
She has two si@@ ster@@ s .
"One in a to@@ as@@ te@@ d-@@ pe@@ an@@ ut sk@@ in and the other , also ad@@ op@@ ted , more on the be@@ i@@ ge side , like a pan@@ cak@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) G@@ ro@@ wing up in this family , col@@ or was never important for me ."
"O@@ ut@@ side home , ho@@ w@@ ever , things were different so@@ on ."
C@@ ol@@ or had many other me@@ an@@ ings .
I remember my first dra@@ wing le@@ s@@ son@@ s in school as a bun@@ ch of con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tor@@ y fe@@ el@@ ings .
It was ex@@ c@@ iting and crea@@ tive but I never under@@ sto@@ od the uni@@ que fle@@ sh@@ -@@ col@@ or@@ ed pen@@ ci@@ l .
I was made of fle@@ sh but I wasn &apos;t p@@ ink .
"My sk@@ in was bro@@ wn , and people said I was black ."
I was seven years old with a me@@ ss of col@@ ors in my head .
"L@@ at@@ er , when I took my cou@@ sin to school , I was u@@ su@@ ally taken for the n@@ an@@ ny ."
"B@@ y help@@ ing in the kit@@ ch@@ en at a friend &apos;s par@@ ty , people thought I was the ma@@ id ."
I was even tre@@ ated like a pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ te just because I was wal@@ king al@@ one on the be@@ ach with Euro@@ pe@@ an friends .
"And many times , vi@@ si@@ ting my gran@@ d@@ ma or friends in u@@ pp@@ er cla@@ ss buil@@ din@@ gs , I was in@@ vi@@ ted not to use the ma@@ in ele@@ v@@ at@@ or ."
"Because in the end , with this col@@ or and this ha@@ ir , I cannot bel@@ ong to some places ."
"In some way , I get to used to it and ac@@ cept part of it ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , something inside of me ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ v@@ ol@@ ving and stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling ."
Ye@@ ars later I mar@@ ri@@ ed a S@@ pan@@ i@@ ard .
But not any S@@ pan@@ i@@ ard .
I ch@@ ose one with the sk@@ in col@@ or of a lob@@ ster when sun@@ bur@@ n@@ t .
"( Laughter ) S@@ ince then , a new question started to ch@@ ase me ."
What will be the col@@ or of your children ?
"As you can understand , this is my last con@@ cer@@ n ."
"But thinking about it , with my pre@@ vi@@ ous bac@@ k@@ ground , my story led me to make my person@@ al ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se as a photo@@ grap@@ her ."
And that is how H@@ u@@ man@@ a@@ e was born .
"H@@ u@@ man@@ a@@ e is a pur@@ su@@ it to high@@ light our true col@@ ors , rather than the un@@ true wh@@ ite , red , black or y@@ el@@ low as@@ soci@@ ated with ra@@ ce ."
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our co@@ des .
It &apos;s a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss from a person@@ al story to a global history .
I p@@ ort@@ ra@@ y the sub@@ je@@ cts in a wh@@ ite bac@@ k@@ ground .
"Th@@ en I cho@@ ose an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ pi@@ x@@ el squ@@ are from the n@@ ose , pa@@ int the bac@@ k@@ ground , and look for the cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or in the indu@@ stri@@ al p@@ alet@@ te , P@@ an@@ t@@ one ."
"I started with my family and friends , then more and more people jo@@ ined the ad@@ ven@@ ture , th@@ an@@ ks to public cal@@ ls coming through the social media ."
I thought that the ma@@ in space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open con@@ cept that in@@ vi@@ tes everybody to p@@ us@@ h the share bu@@ tt@@ on in both the computer and their brain .
The s@@ no@@ w@@ b@@ all started to rol@@ l .
"The project had a great wel@@ come — inv@@ it@@ ations , ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , physi@@ cal forma@@ ts , g@@ al@@ ler@@ ies and mu@@ se@@ um@@ s ..."
just happened .
"And a@@ mon@@ g them , my fav@@ or@@ ite : when H@@ u@@ man@@ a@@ e oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ es public sp@@ ac@@ es and appe@@ ars in the stre@@ et , it f@@ os@@ ters a popu@@ lar de@@ b@@ ate and crea@@ tes a fe@@ eling of community ."
"I have p@@ ort@@ ra@@ y@@ ed more than 3@@ ,000 people in 1@@ 3 different countries , 1@@ 9 different cities around the world ."
"@@ Ju@@ st to men@@ tion some of them — from someone inclu@@ ded in the F@@ or@@ be@@ s li@@ st , to re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who c@@ ros@@ sed the M@@ edi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an by bo@@ at ."
"In Par@@ is , from the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O He@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters to a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
And students both in S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land and fa@@ ve@@ la@@ s in Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o .
"A@@ ll kinds of beli@@ ef@@ s , gen@@ der iden@@ ti@@ ties or physi@@ cal im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ments , a ne@@ w@@ born or ter@@ min@@ ally ill ."
We all together build H@@ u@@ man@@ a@@ e .
Th@@ ose p@@ ort@@ ra@@ its make us re@@ think how we see each other .
"When modern science is ques@@ tion@@ ing the ra@@ ce con@@ cept , what does it mean for us to be black , wh@@ ite , y@@ el@@ low , red ?"
"I@@ s it the eye , the n@@ ose , the m@@ outh , the ha@@ ir ?"
This person@@ al ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se turned out to be a disco@@ very .
Su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I realized that H@@ u@@ man@@ a@@ e was u@@ se@@ ful for many people .
It re@@ presen@@ ts a sort of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r for those who cannot find themselves re@@ fle@@ cted in any la@@ be@@ l .
It was amazing that people started to share their thou@@ ghts about the work with me .
"I have hundre@@ ds of that , I will share with you , too ."
"A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old gir@@ l wr@@ ote me , &quot; &quot; V@@ er@@ y good for me as a to@@ ol to work on her con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce , as this past we@@ ek@@ end one of her gir@@ l@@ friends ar@@ gu@@ ed with her that she does not bel@@ ong and should not be allo@@ wed to live in Nor@@ way ."
"So your work has a very speci@@ al place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman sh@@ ared her p@@ ort@@ ra@@ it on F@@ ace@@ book and wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the g@@ lo@@ be had diffic@@ ul@@ ties to place me in a group , a ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe , a bo@@ x ."
P@@ er@@ haps we should stop .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad of fra@@ ming , ask the individu@@ al , &apos; How would you la@@ be@@ l yourself ? &apos; Th@@ en I would say , &apos; H@@ i . I &apos;m M@@ as@@ si@@ el ."
"I &apos;m a Do@@ min@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ D@@ ut@@ ch , I gre@@ w up in a mi@@ x@@ ed family and I &apos;m a bi@@ se@@ x@@ ual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Be@@ si@@ des these un@@ expe@@ cted and tou@@ ching re@@ ac@@ tions , H@@ u@@ man@@ a@@ e fin@@ ds a new life in a different vari@@ ety of fiel@@ ds ."
I &apos;m very for@@ tun@@ ate to be here .
I feel so for@@ tun@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so im@@ pres@@ sed by the kin@@ d@@ ness ex@@ pres@@ sed to me .
"I called my wi@@ fe L@@ es@@ li@@ e , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good ."
It fe@@ els like I &apos;ve lan@@ ded in a col@@ on@@ y of an@@ gel@@ s . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true fe@@ eling .
But let me get to the talk — I see the c@@ lo@@ ck is run@@ ning .
"I &apos;m a public school te@@ ac@@ her , and I just want to share a story of my su@@ per@@ in@@ ten@@ dent ."
"Her name is P@@ am M@@ or@@ an in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , the f@@ oo@@ th@@ il@@ ls of the B@@ lue R@@ id@@ ge M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
And she &apos;s a very high@@ -@@ te@@ ch su@@ per@@ in@@ ten@@ dent .
"S@@ he uses smar@@ t bo@@ ar@@ ds , she blo@@ gs , she T@@ we@@ ets , she does F@@ ace@@ book , she does all this sort of high@@ -@@ te@@ ch stuff ."
She &apos;s a technology le@@ ad@@ er and in@@ stru@@ c@@ tional le@@ ad@@ er .
"But in her of@@ fi@@ ce , there &apos;s this old w@@ oo@@ den , we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , kit@@ ch@@ en table — pe@@ eling gre@@ en pa@@ int , it &apos;s kind of ri@@ c@@ ket@@ y ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a modern , cu@@ tt@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge person ."
"Wh@@ y is this old table in your of@@ fi@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I gre@@ w up in S@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the far@@ m@@ lan@@ ds of ru@@ ral V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and this table was in my gran@@ d@@ father &apos;s kit@@ ch@@ en ."
"And we &apos;d come in from pla@@ ying , he &apos;d come in from p@@ lo@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , I heard so much knowle@@ dge and so many in@@ si@@ ghts and so much w@@ is@@ dom come out around this table , I began to call it the w@@ is@@ dom table ."
"And when he pas@@ sed on , I took this table with me and b@@ rought it to my of@@ fi@@ ce , and it re@@ min@@ ds me of him ."
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of what goes on around an emp@@ ty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ a@@ me , and essen@@ ti@@ ally it is also an emp@@ ty space ."
"And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 2@@ 1@@ st century w@@ is@@ dom table , really ."
It all started back in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
"I was a young man , and I had been dro@@ pp@@ ing in and out of colle@@ ge ."
"And my parents were very pati@@ ent , but I had been doing inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a my@@ sti@@ cal qu@@ est ."
"And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long wh@@ ite flo@@ wing ro@@ be@@ s and my big be@@ ard and my Joh@@ n L@@ en@@ n@@ on gla@@ s@@ ses — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , da@@ d ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they p@@ lea@@ ded with me to get a de@@ gre@@ e in something ."
So I got a de@@ gre@@ e and it turned out to be education .
It was an experim@@ en@@ tal education program .
"It could have been den@@ ti@@ stry , but the word &quot; &quot; experim@@ en@@ tal &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for ."
"And I went in for a job inter@@ view in the Ri@@ ch@@ mon@@ d P@@ u@@ bli@@ c S@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , the cap@@ ital city , b@@ ou@@ ght a thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ it — my con@@ ce@@ s@@ sion to con@@ ven@@ tion — ke@@ pt my long be@@ ard and my af@@ r@@ o and my pla@@ t@@ form sho@@ es — at the time it was the &apos; 7@@ 0s — and I wal@@ ked in , and I s@@ at down and had an inter@@ view ."
"And I gu@@ ess they were hard up for teach@@ ers because the su@@ per@@ vis@@ or , her name was An@@ na Ar@@ o , said I had the job teach@@ ing gi@@ f@@ ted children ."
"And I was so sho@@ c@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , th@@ ank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) G@@ if@@ ted education ha@@ dn &apos;t really taken h@@ old too much ."
There wer@@ en &apos;t really many materi@@ als or things to use .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer sho@@ c@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me ."
Her answer set the temp@@ late for the entire car@@ e@@ er I was to have after that .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question c@@ lear@@ ed the space ."
"There was no program dire@@ ctive , no man@@ ual to fol@@ low , no stan@@ dar@@ ds in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way ."
"And she c@@ lear@@ ed such a space that I en@@ de@@ av@@ or@@ ed from then on to cle@@ ar a space for my students , an emp@@ ty space , wh@@ er@@ e@@ by they could create and make me@@ an@@ ing out of their own under@@ standing ."
"So this happened in 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and I was teach@@ ing many years later , and a friend of mine in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced me to a young fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er ."
H@@ is name is Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ ina .
Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , vi@@ sion@@ ary fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er who &apos;s made a film ."
( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ chi@@ ev@@ e@@ ments . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ posed the film to me — it &apos;s a great ti@@ tle .
"He pro@@ posed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local T@@ V , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places ."
"Now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but Ch@@ r@@ is has man@@ a@@ ged , through his own sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce , to get this film out ."
"So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one te@@ ac@@ her ."
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ sta@@ ment to teach@@ ing and teach@@ ers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
"And the st@@ range thing is , when I wat@@ ch the film — I have the e@@ er@@ i@@ e sen@@ sa@@ tion of seeing it — I saw myself liter@@ ally dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
What I saw was my teach@@ ers coming through me .
"I saw my ge@@ ome@@ try te@@ ac@@ her in high school , M@@ r. R@@ u@@ cell &apos;s wr@@ y sm@@ ile under his han@@ d@@ le@@ b@@ ar mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ."
That &apos;s the sm@@ ile I use — that &apos;s his sm@@ ile .
I saw J@@ an P@@ ol@@ o &apos;s fla@@ sh@@ ing eyes .
"And they wer@@ en &apos;t fla@@ sh@@ ing in an@@ ger , they were fla@@ sh@@ ing in love , in@@ ten@@ se love for her students ."
And I have that kind of fla@@ sh sometimes .
And I saw M@@ is@@ s E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ an@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ ls and high@@ -@@ he@@ els to ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school every day .
"And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school te@@ ac@@ her st@@ are ."
You know the one .
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that te@@ ac@@ her ?"
"I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
And M@@ is@@ s B@@ an@@ ks was there as a great men@@ tor for me .
"And then I saw my own parents , my first teach@@ ers ."
"My father , very inven@@ tive , sp@@ ati@@ al thin@@ k@@ er ."
That &apos;s my bro@@ ther M@@ al@@ col@@ m there on the right .
"And my mother , who ta@@ u@@ ght me in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de in se@@ gre@@ ga@@ ted sch@@ o@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , who was my in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion ."
"And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a ge@@ st@@ ure she does , like this — I feel like I am a contin@@ u@@ ation of her ge@@ st@@ ure ."
I am one of her teach@@ ing ge@@ stu@@ res .
"And the beautiful thing was , I got to te@@ ach my da@@ u@@ ghter in ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school , Ma@@ de@@ line ."
And so that ge@@ st@@ ure of my mother &apos;s contin@@ u@@ es through many gener@@ ations .
It &apos;s an amazing fe@@ eling to have that lin@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders of many people .
I &apos;m not here al@@ one .
There are many people on this st@@ age right now .
And so this Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ a@@ me I &apos;d like to tell you about .
"It started out like this : it &apos;s just a f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by fi@@ ve@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t p@@ ly@@ wo@@ od bo@@ ard in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city ur@@ b@@ an school , 19@@ 7@@ 8 ."
I was cre@@ ating a le@@ s@@ son for students on Africa .
"We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them sol@@ ve it ."
I didn &apos;t want to le@@ cture or have just book read@@ ing .
I wanted to have them be im@@ mer@@ sed and learn the fe@@ eling of learning through their bo@@ dies .
"So I thought , well they like to play ga@@ mes ."
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say inter@@ ac@@ tive ; we didn &apos;t have that ter@@ m in 19@@ 7@@ 8 — but something inter@@ ac@@ tive .
"And so we made the game , and it has since ev@@ olved to a f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ la@@ ss stru@@ cture ."
And it has four P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ la@@ ss la@@ yer@@ s .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space lay@@ er with black hol@@ es and sa@@ telli@@ tes and research sa@@ telli@@ tes and as@@ ter@@ o@@ id min@@ ing .
"There &apos;s an air and space level with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ ff@@ s of c@@ ot@@ ton we p@@ us@@ h around and ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al air sp@@ ac@@ es and air for@@ ces , a ground and se@@ a level with thousands of game pi@@ e@@ ces on it — even an under@@ se@@ a level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ se@@ a min@@ ing ."
There are four countries around the bo@@ ard .
The kids make up the na@@ mes of the countries — some are ri@@ ch ; some are po@@ or .
"They have different as@@ se@@ ts , com@@ mer@@ cial and mili@@ tar@@ y ."
And each country has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et .
"There &apos;s a P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister , Se@@ cre@@ tar@@ y of S@@ t@@ ate , M@@ in@@ ister of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or Co@@ mp@@ trol@@ ler ."
I cho@@ ose the P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister based on my relation@@ ship with them .
"I off@@ er them the job , they can turn it down , and then they cho@@ ose their own c@@ ab@@ in@@ et ."
"There &apos;s a Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , ar@@ ms de@@ al@@ ers and a United N@@ ations ."
There &apos;s also a we@@ a@@ ther go@@ d@@ de@@ ss who con@@ tr@@ ols a ran@@ dom sto@@ ck market and ran@@ dom we@@ a@@ ther .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ pa@@ ge cri@@ sis do@@ cu@@ ment with 50 inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king problems .
"So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes ."
"I th@@ row them into this comple@@ x ma@@ tri@@ x , and they tru@@ st me because we have a de@@ ep , ri@@ ch relation@@ ship together ."
"And so with all these cri@@ ses , we have — let &apos;s see — e@@ th@@ ni@@ c and min@@ or@@ ity ten@@ sions ; we have chemi@@ cal and n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar sp@@ il@@ ls , n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s oil sp@@ il@@ ls , environ@@ mental dis@@ as@@ ters , water ri@@ ghts di@@ sp@@ u@@ tes , bre@@ ak@@ away re@@ publi@@ cs , fa@@ mine , en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed species and global war@@ ming ."
"If A@@ l G@@ ore is here , I &apos;m going to sen@@ d my f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders from A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and V@@ en@@ able sch@@ o@@ ols to you because they sol@@ ved global war@@ ming in a week ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it sever@@ al times too . ( Laughter )
"So I also have in the game a sa@@ bot@@ e@@ ur — some child — it &apos;s basically a tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er — and I have my tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to sa@@ ve the world and their posi@@ tion in the game ."
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ mine everything in the game .
"And they do it se@@ cre@@ tly through mi@@ sin@@ formation and am@@ bi@@ gu@@ i@@ ties and ir@@ re@@ le@@ van@@ ci@@ es , trying to cause everyone to think more de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"The sa@@ bot@@ e@@ ur is there , and we also read from S@@ un T@@ z@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders understand it — n@@ ine years old — and they han@@ dle that and use that to understand how to , not fol@@ low — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and de@@ stru@@ ction , the pat@@ h to war ."
"They learn to over@@ look sh@@ ort@@ -@@ si@@ gh@@ ted re@@ ac@@ tions and imp@@ ul@@ sive thinking , to think in a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , more con@@ sequ@@ ential way ."
"S@@ te@@ w@@ art B@@ r@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a Co@@ E@@ v@@ olution Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly ar@@ tic@@ le on a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
"And in the game , sometimes students actually form a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
I &apos;m just a c@@ lo@@ ck wat@@ ch@@ er .
I &apos;m just a c@@ lar@@ i@@ fi@@ er . I &apos;m just a fac@@ ili@@ tat@@ or .
The students run the game .
I have no chan@@ ce to make any poli@@ cy w@@ hat@@ so@@ ever once they start pla@@ ying .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( Video ) B@@ o@@ y : The Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ a@@ me is ser@@ i@@ ous .
You &apos;re actually getting ta@@ u@@ ght something like how to take care of the world .
"S@@ e@@ e , M@@ r. H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has mes@@ sed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fi@@ x that problem ."
"@@ Joh@@ n H@@ un@@ ter : I off@@ er@@ ed them a — ( Applause ) A@@ c@@ tually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer ."
And I ad@@ mit the tru@@ th to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
"And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the answer ."
And so I ap@@ ologi@@ ze to them as well .
"I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sor@@ ry , boy@@ s and gir@@ ls , but the tru@@ th is we have left this world to you in such a sa@@ d and ter@@ ri@@ ble shap@@ e , and we hope you can fi@@ x it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sin@@ c@@ ere ap@@ ology , and they take it very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
Now you may be wonder@@ ing what all this comple@@ x@@ ity looks like .
"Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see ."
"( Video ) J@@ H : All right , we &apos;re going into ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations as of now . G@@ o ."
"( C@@ hat@@ ter ) J@@ H : My question to you is , who &apos;s in char@@ ge of that cla@@ ss@@ room ?"
It &apos;s a ser@@ i@@ ous question : who is really in char@@ ge ?
I &apos;ve learned to ce@@ de control of the cla@@ ss@@ room over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a tru@@ st and an under@@ standing and a de@@ di@@ cation to an ide@@ al that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning te@@ ac@@ her : control every conver@@ sa@@ tion and respon@@ se in the cla@@ ss@@ room .
"It &apos;s im@@ possible . Th@@ e@@ ir colle@@ ctive w@@ is@@ dom is much gre@@ at@@ er than mine , and I ad@@ mit it to them open@@ ly ."
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some ma@@ gi@@ cal things that have happened .
"In this game we had a little gir@@ l , and she was the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ister of the po@@ or@@ est n@@ ation ."
And the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ister — she had the tan@@ k cor@@ ps and A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce and so for@@ th .
"And she was next do@@ or to a very we@@ al@@ thy , o@@ il@@ -@@ ri@@ ch neigh@@ b@@ or ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out pro@@ vo@@ cation , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly she at@@ tac@@ ked , against her P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister &apos;s or@@ ders , the ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or neigh@@ b@@ or &apos;s oil fiel@@ ds ."
"S@@ he mar@@ ched into the oil field re@@ ser@@ ves , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded it , without fir@@ ing a sho@@ t , and se@@ cu@@ red it and hel@@ d it ."
And that neigh@@ b@@ or was un@@ able to con@@ du@@ ct any mili@@ tar@@ y oper@@ ations because their fu@@ el supp@@ ly was lo@@ c@@ ked up .
"We were all up@@ set with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?"
"This is the Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ a@@ me . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little gir@@ l and , at n@@ ine years old , she hel@@ d her pi@@ e@@ ces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; T@@ o her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that ."
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
"And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to c@@ ross a n@@ ine ye@@ ar-@@ old gir@@ l with tan@@ ks ."
( Laughter ) They are the tou@@ gh@@ est opp@@ on@@ ents .
And we were very up@@ set .
I thought I was fa@@ il@@ ing as a te@@ ac@@ her . Why would she do this ?
"But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation peri@@ od with all te@@ a@@ ms , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day ."
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this maj@@ or country was plan@@ ning a mili@@ tar@@ y off@@ en@@ sive to do@@ min@@ ate the entire world .
"H@@ ad they had their fu@@ el supp@@ li@@ es , they would have done it ."
She was able to see the ve@@ c@@ tors and tr@@ end lin@@ es and in@@ ten@@ tions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hi@@ cal deci@@ sion to at@@ tac@@ k in a pe@@ ace game .
"Now she used a small war to a@@ ver@@ t a lar@@ ger war , so we st@@ opp@@ ed and had a very good ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hi@@ cal dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion about whether that was right , con@@ di@@ tional good , or not right ."
"That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the si@@ tu@@ ations ."
I could not have desig@@ ned that in teach@@ ing it .
It came about spon@@ tane@@ ously through their colle@@ ctive w@@ is@@ dom .
"( Applause ) A@@ no@@ ther example , a beautiful thing happened ."
We have a let@@ ter in the game .
"If you &apos;re a mili@@ tar@@ y com@@ man@@ der and you w@@ age tro@@ op@@ s — the little pla@@ stic to@@ ys on the bo@@ ard — and you l@@ ose them , I put in a let@@ ter ."
You have to wr@@ ite a let@@ ter to their parents — the fic@@ tional parents of your fic@@ tional tro@@ op@@ s — expla@@ ining what happened and off@@ ering your con@@ dol@@ ences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you com@@ mit to com@@ b@@ at .
"And so we had this si@@ tu@@ ation come up — last su@@ m@@ mer actually , at A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t S@@ ch@@ ool in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty — and one of our mili@@ tar@@ y com@@ man@@ ders got up to read that let@@ ter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r. H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent vi@@ si@@ ting that day , just si@@ tting in the back of the room ."
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mo@@ m to read the let@@ ter .
"It &apos;ll be more real@@ er if she re@@ ads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she ga@@ me@@ ly pic@@ ked up the let@@ ter ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started read@@ ing . She read one sen@@ t@@ ence .
She read two sen@@ ten@@ ces .
"B@@ y the third sen@@ t@@ ence , she was in te@@ ars ."
I was in te@@ ars .
"E@@ very@@ body under@@ sto@@ od that when we l@@ ose somebody , the win@@ ners are not g@@ lo@@ ating ."
We all l@@ ose .
And it was an amazing oc@@ cur@@ ren@@ ce and an amazing under@@ standing .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend Da@@ vi@@ d says about this .
He &apos;s been in many bat@@ t@@ les .
( Video ) Da@@ vi@@ d : We &apos;ve really had enough of people at@@ tac@@ king .
"I mean , we &apos;ve been lu@@ ck@@ y &#91; most of &#93; the time ."
But now I &apos;m fe@@ eling really we@@ ird because I &apos;m living what S@@ un T@@ z@@ u said one week .
"One week he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose who go into bat@@ tle and w@@ in will want to go back , and those who l@@ ose in bat@@ tle will want to go back and w@@ in . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been win@@ ning bat@@ t@@ les , so I &apos;m going into bat@@ t@@ les , more bat@@ t@@ les ."
And I think it &apos;s sort of we@@ ird to be living what S@@ un T@@ z@@ u said .
J@@ H : I get chil@@ ls every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment you want to have happen .
"And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t pla@@ n that , and I can &apos;t even test that ."
But it &apos;s self-@@ ev@@ id@@ ent as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment of learning .
"We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go be@@ yon@@ d data with the real tru@@ th of what &apos;s going on ."
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ ren@@ n@@ an .
"We had pla@@ y@@ ed the game one ses@@ sion after school for many we@@ eks , about seven we@@ eks , and we had essen@@ ti@@ ally sol@@ ved all 50 of the inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king cri@@ ses ."
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s as@@ set value has to be incre@@ as@@ ed ab@@ o@@ ve its star@@ ting point .
"S@@ ome are po@@ or , some are we@@ al@@ thy . There are bil@@ lions ."
The Wor@@ ld B@@ ank pre@@ si@@ dent was a th@@ ir@@ d-@@ gra@@ der one time .
"He says , &quot; &quot; How many zer@@ os in a tr@@ il@@ lion ? I &apos;ve got to cal@@ cu@@ late that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was se@@ tting f@@ is@@ cal poli@@ cy in that game for high school pla@@ yer@@ s who were pla@@ ying with him ."
So the team that was the po@@ or@@ est had g@@ ot@@ ten even po@@ or@@ er .
There was no way they could w@@ in .
"And we were appro@@ ach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck , our cu@@ t-@@ off time — there was about a minu@@ te left — and de@@ sp@@ air just se@@ tt@@ led over the room ."
"I thought , I &apos;m fa@@ il@@ ing as a te@@ ac@@ her ."
I should have g@@ ot@@ ten it so they could have won .
They sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fa@@ il@@ ing like this .
I &apos;ve fa@@ i@@ led them .
And I was just fe@@ eling so sa@@ d and de@@ je@@ cted .
"And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , B@@ ren@@ n@@ an wal@@ ked over to my cha@@ ir and he gra@@ b@@ bed the be@@ ll , the be@@ ll I r@@ ing to sig@@ n@@ al a change or a re@@ con@@ ven@@ ing of c@@ ab@@ in@@ ets , and he ran back to his se@@ at , ran@@ g the be@@ ll ."
"E@@ very@@ body ran to his cha@@ ir : there was scre@@ am@@ ing ; there was y@@ el@@ ling , wa@@ ving of their d@@ os@@ si@@ ers ."
They get these d@@ os@@ si@@ ers full of se@@ cre@@ t do@@ cu@@ ments .
They were ge@@ sti@@ cu@@ la@@ ting ; they were run@@ ning around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my cla@@ ss@@ room .
"P@@ r@@ in@@ cip@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a job ."
The parents were looking in the win@@ do@@ w .
And B@@ ren@@ n@@ an run@@ s back to his se@@ at . E@@ very@@ body run@@ s back to their se@@ at .
"He r@@ ings the be@@ ll again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 secon@@ ds left on the c@@ lo@@ ck — &quot; &quot; we have , all na@@ tions , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together ."
And we &apos;ve got 6@@ 00 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to off@@ er it as a don@@ ation to this po@@ or country .
"And if they ac@@ cept it , it &apos;ll ra@@ ise their as@@ set value and we can w@@ in the game ."
W@@ ill you ac@@ cept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three secon@@ ds left on the c@@ lo@@ ck .
"E@@ very@@ body looks at this pri@@ me min@@ ister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; And the game is won ."
"S@@ p@@ on@@ tane@@ ous comp@@ as@@ sion that could not be plan@@ ned for , that was un@@ expe@@ cted and un@@ predi@@ c@@ table ."
E@@ very game we play is different .
"S@@ ome ga@@ mes are more about social issu@@ es , some are more about economic issu@@ es ."
S@@ ome ga@@ mes are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to den@@ y them that reality of being human .
"I al@@ low them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a blo@@ od@@ less way , how not to do what they consi@@ der to be the wrong thing ."
"And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves ."
"And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pic@@ k up a cri@@ tical thinking to@@ ol or crea@@ tive thinking to@@ ol from this game and le@@ verage something good for the world , they may sa@@ ve us all ."
If only .
"And on be@@ half of all of my teach@@ ers on wh@@ ose sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders I &apos;m standing , th@@ ank you . Thank you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn k@@ id .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small vil@@ la@@ ge in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n So@@ mal@@ ia .
H@@ is vil@@ la@@ ge is ne@@ ar Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
D@@ rought dri@@ ves the small vil@@ la@@ ge into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ ith nothing left for him there , he lea@@ ves for the big city , in this case , Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the cap@@ ital of So@@ mal@@ ia ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opport@@ uni@@ ties , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way for@@ ward ."
He ends up living in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"M@@ ay@@ be a year pas@@ ses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ un@@ ch , then to din@@ ner , to bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
"He me@@ ets this dy@@ na@@ mic group of people , and they give him a bre@@ ak ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y hi@@ m@@ self some new c@@ lo@@ the@@ s , money to sen@@ d back home to his family ."
He is in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to this young woman .
He ev@@ en@@ tually gets mar@@ ri@@ ed .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ p@@ ose in life .
"One beautiful day in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , under an az@@ ure b@@ lue sk@@ y , a car bo@@ m@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn k@@ id with the big city dre@@ a@@ ms was the su@@ ici@@ de bo@@ mber , and that dy@@ na@@ mic group of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st organiz@@ ation lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ e@@ da ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn k@@ id just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing hi@@ m@@ self up ?
He was wa@@ iting .
"He was wa@@ iting for an opport@@ unity , wa@@ iting to be@@ gin his future , wa@@ iting for a way for@@ ward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od .
And his story re@@ pe@@ at@@ s itself in ur@@ b@@ an cen@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ chi@@ sed , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ur@@ b@@ an y@@ outh who s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in Jo@@ han@@ nes@@ bur@@ g , s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in L@@ on@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
"For young people , the pro@@ mi@@ se of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opport@@ unity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not sh@@ aring in the pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ outh who su@@ ff@@ er from the high@@ est un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ra@@ tes .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provi@@ de them opport@@ uni@@ ties , the story of wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od , the ga@@ te@@ way to ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , to viol@@ ence , to gan@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , 70 percent of young people su@@ ff@@ er from un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vi@@ sit M@@ ad@@ ina H@@ osp@@ ital , the h@@ osp@@ ital I was born in ."
"I remember standing in front of that bul@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ d@@ den h@@ osp@@ ital thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ ced into that same state of wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to h@@ ost a y@@ outh lea@@ der@@ ship and en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship su@@ m@@ mit .
I b@@ rought together about 9@@ 0 young So@@ mal@@ i lea@@ ders .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ in@@ stor@@ med on solu@@ tions to the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to uni@@ versity in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opport@@ uni@@ ties ."
"I remember him telling me , because he was a colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted , that he was the per@@ fect tar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st organiz@@ ations , to be re@@ cru@@ i@@ ted ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
"In Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the big@@ gest bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ads ."
"T@@ w@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ three years of ci@@ vi@@ l war have completely de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed the ro@@ ad system , and a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the eas@@ i@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opport@@ unity and se@@ ized it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He began ren@@ ting out mot@@ or@@ bi@@ kes to local resi@@ dents who couldn &apos;t nor@@ m@@ ally af@@ for@@ d them .
"He b@@ ou@@ ght 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually exp@@ and to sever@@ al hun@@ d@@ red within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y and se@@ ize a new opport@@ unity .
"It &apos;s en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship , and I believe en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship can be the most powerful to@@ ol against wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
It emp@@ ow@@ ers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very economic opport@@ uni@@ ties they are so des@@ per@@ ately se@@ ek@@ ing .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , Mo@@ ha@@ med Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d , a f@@ l@@ ori@@ st ."
He was help@@ ing me tra@@ in some of the young people at the su@@ m@@ mit in en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship and how to be inno@@ va@@ tive and how to create a culture of en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first f@@ l@@ ori@@ st Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until re@@ cen@@ tly , until Mo@@ ha@@ med came along , if you wanted flo@@ w@@ ers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used pla@@ stic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pp@@ ed from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; Wh@@ en was the last time you saw f@@ res@@ h flo@@ w@@ ers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under ci@@ vi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ ha@@ med saw an opport@@ unity ."
He started a lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ ing and design f@@ lor@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , and started gro@@ wing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ li@@ es , which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ sh Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u cli@@ mate ."
"And he began deli@@ ver@@ ing flo@@ w@@ ers to we@@ d@@ din@@ gs , cre@@ ating gar@@ den@@ s at ho@@ mes and busin@@ es@@ ses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"He wan@@ ts to create a space where famili@@ es , young people , can come together , and , as he says , s@@ me@@ ll the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ros@@ es ."
"And he doesn &apos;t grow ros@@ es because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first step is to in@@ sp@@ ire young people , and in that room , Mo@@ ha@@ med &apos;s presen@@ ce had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the y@@ outh in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his inno@@ v@@ ation , really had a str@@ ong imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ ced them to look at their city as a place of opport@@ unity .
"He emp@@ o@@ wer@@ ed them to believe that they could be en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ s , that they could be change mak@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with inno@@ va@@ tive solu@@ tions to some of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ u@@ ri@@ al solu@@ tions to local problems .
"So in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young people and cre@@ ating a culture of en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and men@@ tor@@ ship to gu@@ ide them in develop@@ ing and la@@ un@@ ching their busin@@ es@@ ses .
"C@@ on@@ ne@@ ct young people with the resour@@ ces they need , provi@@ de them the supp@@ ort they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create cat@@ al@@ y@@ sts for ur@@ b@@ an growth ."
"For me , en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social imp@@ act .
Mo@@ ha@@ med is not simply sel@@ ling flo@@ w@@ ers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is P@@ e@@ ace Par@@ k , and that &apos;s what he cal@@ ls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help r@@ ent out and ma@@ in@@ tain those bi@@ kes for him .
He gave them the opport@@ unity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ al@@ y@@ sis of wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od .
These young en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ s are having a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous imp@@ act in their cities .
"So my sug@@ ge@@ s@@ tion is , turn y@@ outh into en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent inno@@ v@@ ation , and you will have more stories of flo@@ w@@ ers and P@@ e@@ ace P@@ ark@@ s than of car bo@@ mb@@ s and wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
Thank you .

"O@@ kay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play ."
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t real@@ ize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
"( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) O@@ kay , so first of all , let &apos;s wel@@ come M@@ r. J@@ a@@ mi@@ re W@@ il@@ li@@ a@@ ms on the dru@@ ms , ( Applause ) B@@ ur@@ n@@ is@@ s T@@ ra@@ v@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and M@@ r. Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an San@@ ds on the pi@@ an@@ o . ( Applause )"
"So the ban@@ d@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredi@@ ble space ."
It is really a sa@@ cre@@ d space .
"And one of the things that is really sa@@ cre@@ d about it is that you have no opport@@ unity to think about the future , or the past ."
You really are ali@@ ve right here in this moment .
There are so many deci@@ sions being made when you walk on the ban@@ d@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
"In the middle , we sort of made our way into a son@@ g called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i B@@ oo@@ m . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not ."
E@@ very@@ one &apos;s list@@ en@@ ing . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for proje@@ cted ideas .
"So the idea of a mi@@ st@@ ake : F@@ rom the per@@ spe@@ ctive of a j@@ az@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to talk about someone else &apos;s mi@@ st@@ ake ."
"So the way I per@@ ce@@ ive a mi@@ st@@ ake when I &apos;m on the ban@@ d@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mi@@ st@@ ake ."
The only mi@@ st@@ ake li@@ es in that I &apos;m not able to per@@ ce@@ ive what it is that someone else did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; mi@@ st@@ ake &quot; &quot; is an opport@@ unity in j@@ az@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even des@@ cri@@ be what a fun@@ ny n@@ ote would be .
"So for example , if I pla@@ y@@ ed a col@@ or , like we were pla@@ ying on a p@@ alet@@ te , that s@@ oun@@ ded like this ..."
( Mu@@ sic ) So if Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an pla@@ y@@ ed a n@@ ote — like play an F@@ . ( Mu@@ sic )
"S@@ e@@ e , these are all right inside of the col@@ or p@@ alet@@ te ."
If you pla@@ y@@ ed an E@@ .
"S@@ e@@ e , these all li@@ e right inside of this gener@@ al emo@@ tional p@@ alet@@ te that we were pain@@ ting ."
"If you pla@@ y@@ ed an F # though , ( D@@ is@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s e@@ ars , they would per@@ ce@@ ive that as a mi@@ st@@ ake ."
"So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second ."
And we &apos;re going to play on this p@@ alet@@ te .
"And at some point , Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an will in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce this n@@ ote ."
And we won &apos;t re@@ act to it .
"He &apos;ll in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second ."
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this p@@ alet@@ te .
( Mu@@ sic ) So someone could con@@ cep@@ tually per@@ ce@@ ive that as a mi@@ st@@ ake .
The only way that I would say it was a mi@@ st@@ ake is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opport@@ unity that was mis@@ sed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predi@@ c@@ table . We &apos;ll pa@@ int this p@@ alet@@ te again .
"He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change ."
"We &apos;ll all ac@@ cept his ideas , or not ."
"( Mu@@ sic ) So you see , he pla@@ y@@ ed this n@@ ote ."
I en@@ ded up cre@@ ating a me@@ lo@@ dy out of it .
The te@@ x@@ ture changed in the dru@@ ms this time .
"It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic , a little bit more in@@ ten@@ se in respon@@ se to how I respon@@ ded to it ."
So there is no mi@@ st@@ ake .
"The only mi@@ st@@ ake is if I &apos;m not aw@@ are , if each individu@@ al mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an is not aw@@ are and ac@@ cep@@ ting enough of his fel@@ low b@@ and me@@ mber to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for crea@@ tivity ."
"So j@@ az@@ z , this ban@@ d@@ stand is absolu@@ tely amazing ."
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ying experience .
And I know that I spe@@ ak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gran@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the ban@@ d@@ stand and play music is a b@@ le@@ ss@@ ing .
So how does this all rela@@ te to behavi@@ or@@ al finan@@ ce ?
"Well we &apos;re j@@ az@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans , so ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pic@@ ally we don &apos;t have a great relation@@ ship to finan@@ ce ."
"( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we han@@ dle it ."
And the other dy@@ na@@ mic of it is that we don &apos;t mi@@ cro@@ man@@ age in j@@ az@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually lim@@ its the arti@@ stic possi@@ bili@@ ties .
"If I come up and I di@@ c@@ t@@ ate to the b@@ and that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just ju@@ mp right in ..."
"@@ ready , just play some time ."
"One , two , one , two , three , four ."
( Mu@@ sic ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ o@@ tic because I &apos;m bul@@ lying my ideas .
"I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to list@@ en ."
This is a science of list@@ en@@ ing .
It has far more to do with what I can per@@ ce@@ ive than what it is that I can do .
"So if I want the music to get to a certain level of in@@ ten@@ si@@ ty , the first step for me is to be pati@@ ent , to list@@ en to what &apos;s going on and pul@@ l from something that &apos;s going on around me ."
"When you do that , you en@@ ga@@ ge and in@@ sp@@ ire the other mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and they give you more , and gra@@ du@@ ally it buil@@ ds ."
"W@@ at@@ ch . One , two , a one , two , three , four ."
( Mu@@ sic ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pul@@ ling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organ@@ ic . It &apos;s much more n@@ u@@ an@@ ced .
It &apos;s not about bul@@ lying my vision or anything like that .
"It &apos;s about being here in the moment , ac@@ cep@@ ting one another and allo@@ wing crea@@ tivity to f@@ low ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challen@@ ges is to inno@@ v@@ ate fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ al@@ led to in education ."
This one te@@ ac@@ her didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incredi@@ ble spe@@ e@@ ches and ideas that are being sp@@ read , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward posi@@ tion of being here to talk to you today about tele@@ vision ."
So most everyone wat@@ ches T@@ V .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
"H@@ ere in America , people actually love T@@ V ."
The a@@ verage American wat@@ ches T@@ V for almost 5 hours a day .
O@@ kay ?
"Now I happen to make my living these days in tele@@ vision , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
"They , in fact , ber@@ ate it ."
"They call it stu@@ p@@ id , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"My mother , gro@@ wing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ ot bo@@ x . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe tele@@ vision has a con@@ science ."
"So why I believe that tele@@ vision has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that tele@@ vision dire@@ c@@ tly re@@ fle@@ cts the mor@@ al , political , social and emo@@ tional need sta@@ tes of our n@@ ation — that tele@@ vision is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire value system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ science ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re talking about popu@@ lar T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about top@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted sho@@ ws over the course of 50 years .
"H@@ ow do these N@@ i@@ el@@ sen ra@@ tin@@ gs re@@ fle@@ ct not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , colle@@ ctive un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous , but how do these top@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted sho@@ ws over 50 years re@@ fle@@ ct the idea of our social con@@ science ?"
"H@@ ow does tele@@ vision ev@@ ol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?"
"Now spe@@ ak@@ ing of ev@@ olution , from bas@@ ic bi@@ ology , you probably remember that the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , inclu@@ ding humans , have four bas@@ ic pri@@ mal in@@ st@@ in@@ cts ."
You have hun@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qui@@ si@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
"As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve develop@@ ed , we &apos;ve ev@@ olved over time to temp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these bas@@ ic anima@@ l in@@ st@@ in@@ cts ."
We have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to la@@ u@@ gh and c@@ ry .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and ap@@ art from the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ined .
We love to wat@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ para@@ tes us from the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom .
"An@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to wat@@ ch ."
So I had an am@@ bi@@ tion to disco@@ ver what could be under@@ sto@@ od from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human relation@@ ship between tele@@ vision progra@@ ms and the human con@@ sci@@ ous .
Why has tele@@ vision en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ev@@ olved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on de@@ vi@@ l or an@@ ge@@ l si@@ tting on our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders .
"I@@ s tele@@ vision liter@@ ally fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing as our con@@ science , temp@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to be@@ gin to answer these questions , we did a research study ."
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed the top@@ -@@ 20 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen sho@@ ws every year for 50 years — a thou@@ s@@ and sho@@ ws .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — a@@ ged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emo@@ tion@@ ally ."
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these sho@@ ws ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? D@@ id you la@@ u@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our global TED audi@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.@@ S@@ . sa@@ mple ."
"But as you can see , these emo@@ tional need sta@@ tes are tru@@ ly uni@@ ver@@ sal ."
"And on a fac@@ tual bas@@ is , over 80 percent of the U.@@ S@@ . &apos; s most popu@@ lar sho@@ ws are exp@@ or@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hope our global audi@@ ences can rela@@ te .
"T@@ w@@ o ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data sli@@ de : F@@ or in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tri@@ cks that con@@ science can play on us on a da@@ ily bas@@ is , I th@@ ank le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary ra@@ b@@ bi , J@@ ac@@ k S@@ ter@@ n ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to th@@ ank TED community su@@ per@@ st@@ ar H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen ."
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study ."
"T@@ w@@ o things we &apos;re going to start with — the in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion state and the mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity state , which , for this pur@@ p@@ ose , we defin@@ ed in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion as tele@@ vision sho@@ ws that up@@ li@@ ft me , that make me feel much more posi@@ tive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity are tele@@ vi@@ sions sho@@ ws in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
"As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion is hol@@ ding ste@@ ad@@ y ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity star@@ ts to cli@@ m@@ b .
"R@@ ight at the end of the 6@@ 0s , mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion is kind of on the wan@@ e ."
Why ?
"The C@@ u@@ b@@ an M@@ is@@ s@@ ile C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is sho@@ t , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ igh@@ ts mo@@ vement , ra@@ ce ri@@ ots , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sho@@ t , B@@ ob@@ by Ken@@ ne@@ dy is sho@@ t , W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate ."
Lo@@ ok what happens .
"In 19@@ 70 , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion p@@ lu@@ mme@@ ts ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity takes off .
"They c@@ ross , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ a@@ gan , a tele@@ gen@@ ic pre@@ si@@ dent , is in of@@ fi@@ ce ."
It &apos;s trying to reco@@ ver .
"But look , it can &apos;t : A@@ I@@ D@@ S , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tr@@ a , the C@@ hal@@ len@@ ger dis@@ as@@ ter , C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity be@@ comes the do@@ min@@ ant me@@ me in tele@@ vision from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
T@@ ake a look at this .
This ch@@ art is going to do@@ cu@@ ment a very si@@ mi@@ lar tr@@ end .
"But in this case , we have com@@ for@@ t — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — social com@@ men@@ tar@@ y and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in b@@ lue and gre@@ en ."
"Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ an@@ za , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have do@@ me@@ stic sho@@ ws all about com@@ for@@ t ."
This is ris@@ ing . C@@ om@@ for@@ t st@@ ays whole .
I@@ r@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to ri@@ se .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ tar@@ y is all of a su@@ d@@ den sp@@ ik@@ ing up .
"You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happens ."
"You have com@@ for@@ t , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and social com@@ men@@ tar@@ y , not only bat@@ t@@ ling it out in our society , but you liter@@ ally have two est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment sho@@ ws — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ yle &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ thre@@ e-@@ ra@@ ted tele@@ vision sho@@ ws ."
What &apos;s number one ?
"The soci@@ ally ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ p@@ pi@@ e show , &quot; Ro@@ w@@ an and Mar@@ tin &apos;s Lau@@ gh@@ -@@ In . &quot;"
"They &apos;re all living together , right ."
V@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ers had respon@@ ded dra@@ ma@@ tically .
Lo@@ ok at this gre@@ en sp@@ ik@@ e in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show .
"When you guys hear this indu@@ stry ter@@ m , a bre@@ ak@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ thers B@@ ro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where ."
"This was the first show that allo@@ wed vie@@ w@@ ers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , about the pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy , through tele@@ vision ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ ak@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last ch@@ art , look what happens ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the dam bur@@ sts . The dam bur@@ sts ."
C@@ om@@ for@@ t is no longer why we wat@@ ch tele@@ vision .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ tar@@ y and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ri@@ se throu@@ gh@@ out the 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this .
The 7@@ 0s means who ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
"You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ a@@ mily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ for@@ d and S@@ on , &quot; &quot; and the do@@ min@@ ant show — in the top@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 7@@ 0s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;"
"In the entire 50 years of tele@@ vision that we stu@@ died , seven of 10 sho@@ ws ran@@ ked most high@@ ly for ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence appe@@ ared on air during the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , five of the top@@ -@@ 10 during the N@@ i@@ x@@ on ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion ."
"On@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 20 years in , and we disco@@ vered , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?"
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
"So to this very , very sav@@ v@@ y cro@@ w@@ d , I also want to n@@ ote the di@@ git@@ al fol@@ ks did not inv@@ ent dis@@ rup@@ tive ."
Ar@@ chi@@ e Bun@@ k@@ er was sho@@ ved out of his easy cha@@ ir along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
"This is a quic@@ k ch@@ art . Here &apos;s another at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te : fan@@ tas@@ y and ima@@ gin@@ ation , which are sho@@ ws defin@@ ed as , &quot; takes me out of my every@@ day real@@ m &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s m@@ app@@ ed against the red do@@ t , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , which is a simple Bu@@ re@@ a@@ u of L@@ ab@@ or De@@ part@@ ment sta@@ ti@@ stic ."
"You &apos;ll see that every time fan@@ tas@@ y and ima@@ gin@@ ation sho@@ ws ri@@ se , it m@@ ap@@ s to a sp@@ ik@@ e in un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
D@@ o we want to see sho@@ ws about people sa@@ ving money and being un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ?
"N@@ o . In the 7@@ 0s you have the bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ on@@ ic W@@ o@@ man &quot; &quot; that ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ted into the top@@ -@@ 10 in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , fol@@ lo@@ wed by the &quot; &quot; S@@ i@@ x M@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ D@@ ol@@ lar M@@ an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; C@@ har@@ li@@ e &apos;s An@@ gel@@ s . &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther sp@@ ik@@ e in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s — another sp@@ ik@@ e in sho@@ ws about control and power ."
What were those sho@@ ws ?
G@@ la@@ mor@@ ous and ri@@ ch .
"&quot; D@@ al@@ la@@ s , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ tas@@ y I@@ s@@ land . &quot;"
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble m@@ app@@ ing of our national p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e with some hard and f@@ ast fac@@ ts : un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
"So here you are , in my fav@@ or@@ ite ch@@ art , because this is our last 20 years ."
"W@@ he@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my business , you have su@@ re@@ ly heard or read of the de@@ cl@@ ine of the thing called the thre@@ e-@@ ca@@ mera si@@ t@@ co@@ m and the ri@@ se of reality T@@ V ."
"Well , as we say in the business , X mark@@ s the s@@ po@@ t ."
"The 9@@ 0s — the big bu@@ b@@ b@@ les of h@@ um@@ or — we &apos;re wat@@ ching &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ras@@ i@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ in@@ fel@@ d . &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing &apos;s good , low un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
But look : X mark@@ s the s@@ po@@ t .
"In 200@@ 1 , the S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 1 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , h@@ um@@ or suc@@ cu@@ mb@@ s to ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment once and for all ."
Why not ?
We had a 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al ele@@ ction decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ sting of the te@@ ch bu@@ b@@ ble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x be@@ comes part of the social le@@ x@@ ic@@ on .
Lo@@ ok what happens when we keep going .
"A@@ t the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality tele@@ vision has taken h@@ old ."
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a .
G@@ ive me some com@@ for@@ t ; my world is fal@@ ling ap@@ art .
"N@@ o , they want ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment ."
I can v@@ ote you off the is@@ land .
I can keep S@@ ara@@ h P@@ al@@ in &apos;s da@@ u@@ ghter dan@@ cing .

"That &apos;s all great , right ?"
"So as dra@@ ma@@ tically different as these tele@@ vision sho@@ ws , p@@ ure en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one bas@@ ic in@@ st@@ in@@ ct re@@ ma@@ ins ."
"We &apos;re animals , we need our mo@@ ms ."
"There has not been a deca@@ de of tele@@ vision without a defin@@ i@@ tive , do@@ min@@ ant T@@ V mo@@ m ."
"The 19@@ 5@@ 0s : J@@ un@@ e C@@ le@@ ever in the ori@@ gin@@ al com@@ for@@ t show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ a@@ ve it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; L@@ uc@@ il@@ le B@@ all ke@@ pt us la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing through the ri@@ se of social con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness in the 6@@ 0s ."
"M@@ au@@ de F@@ in@@ d@@ la@@ y , the ep@@ it@@ ome of the ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent 19@@ 7@@ 0s , who tac@@ k@@ led ab@@ or@@ tion , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce , even men@@ op@@ a@@ use on T@@ V ."
"The 19@@ 8@@ 0s , our first cou@@ g@@ ar was given to us in the form of A@@ le@@ x@@ is Car@@ r@@ ing@@ ton ."
M@@ ur@@ ph@@ y B@@ ro@@ wn took on a vice pre@@ si@@ dent when she took on the idea of single par@@ en@@ th@@ o@@ od .
"This er@@ a &apos;s mo@@ m , B@@ ree V@@ an de K@@ am@@ p ."
"Now I don &apos;t know if this is the de@@ vi@@ l or the an@@ ge@@ l si@@ tting on our con@@ science , si@@ tting on tele@@ vision &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , but I do know that I absolu@@ tely love this image ."
"So to you all , the women of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , the men of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , the global audi@@ ences of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me present my idea about the con@@ science of tele@@ vision ."
But let me also th@@ ank the incredi@@ ble cre@@ at@@ ors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our tele@@ vision scre@@ en@@ s throu@@ gh@@ out all these a@@ ges of tele@@ vision .
"They give it life on tele@@ vision , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ w@@ ers , through your colle@@ ctive social con@@ sci@@ ences , that give it life , lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity , power or not ."
So th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide We@@ b has absolu@@ tely trans@@ for@@ med publi@@ sh@@ ing , bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting , com@@ mer@@ ce and social conne@@ c@@ tivity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ anne@@ var B@@ us@@ h , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art and T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e ."
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ anne@@ var B@@ us@@ h .
V@@ anne@@ var B@@ us@@ h was the U.@@ S@@ . government &apos;s chi@@ ef scienti@@ fic ad@@ vis@@ er during the war .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he publi@@ shed an ar@@ tic@@ le in a ma@@ gaz@@ ine called A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic M@@ on@@ th@@ ly ."
And the ar@@ tic@@ le was called &quot; &quot; A@@ s We M@@ ay Th@@ ink . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ anne@@ var B@@ us@@ h was saying was the way we use information is bro@@ ken .
We don &apos;t work in terms of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies and cat@@ al@@ o@@ g systems and so for@@ th .
The brain works by as@@ soci@@ ation .
"W@@ ith one ite@@ m in its thought , it s@@ n@@ ap@@ s in@@ stan@@ tly to the next ite@@ m ."
And the way information is stru@@ c@@ tu@@ red is tot@@ ally in@@ cap@@ able of ke@@ ep@@ ing up with this process .
"And so he sug@@ ge@@ s@@ ted a machine , and he called it the me@@ me@@ x ."
"And the me@@ me@@ x would lin@@ k information , one piece of information to a rela@@ ted piece of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A computer in those days was something the se@@ cre@@ t serv@@ ices used to use for co@@ de bre@@ ak@@ ing .
And no@@ body knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was inven@@ ted .
And he pro@@ posed this machine called the me@@ me@@ x .
"And he had a pla@@ t@@ form where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ in@@ ning for@@ ward , one of the guys who read this ar@@ tic@@ le was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.@@ S@@ . A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce off@@ ic@@ er ."
And he was read@@ ing it in their li@@ br@@ ary in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so in@@ spi@@ red by this ar@@ tic@@ le , it kind of dire@@ cted the rest of his life ."
"And by the mid@@ -@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the S@@ tan@@ for@@ d Re@@ search La@@ b in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
He built a system .
"The system was desig@@ ned to au@@ g@@ ment human in@@ telli@@ gen@@ ce , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tion of today &apos;s world of cl@@ ou@@ d compu@@ ting and so@@ f@@ tw@@ ar@@ es of ser@@ vice , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine S@@ y@@ ste@@ m ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art .
He was gi@@ ving a presen@@ tation at the F@@ all Jo@@ int Co@@ mp@@ u@@ ter Con@@ fer@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"What he sho@@ wed — he s@@ at on a st@@ age like this , and he de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted this system ."
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between do@@ cu@@ ments and grap@@ hi@@ cs and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this pla@@ t@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fin@@ ger ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first computer m@@ ouse , which he speci@@ ally desig@@ ned in order to do this system ."
So this is where the m@@ ouse came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art .
The tr@@ ou@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those days cost sever@@ al million p@@ ounds .
"So for a person@@ al computer , a few million p@@ ounds was like having a person@@ al j@@ et plan@@ e ; it wasn &apos;t really very pra@@ c@@ tical ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when person@@ al compu@@ ters did ar@@ ri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on person@@ al compu@@ ters ."
"And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called G@@ u@@ ide for the Ap@@ ple M@@ ac@@ in@@ t@@ os@@ h ."
And we deli@@ vered the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ text system .
And this began to get a head of ste@@ am .
"A@@ pp@@ le in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced a thing called H@@ y@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a fu@@ ss about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ pa@@ ge supp@@ le@@ ment in the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ n@@ al the day it la@@ un@@ ched .
The ma@@ gaz@@ ines started to co@@ ver it .
B@@ y@@ te ma@@ gaz@@ ine and C@@ om@@ m@@ uni@@ ca@@ tions at the A@@ C@@ M had speci@@ al issu@@ es co@@ ver@@ ing hy@@ per@@ text .
We develop@@ ed a P@@ C ver@@ sion of this produ@@ ct as well as the M@@ ac@@ in@@ t@@ os@@ h ver@@ sion .
And our P@@ C ver@@ sion became quite ma@@ ture .
These are some exa@@ mp@@ les of this system in action in the late 8@@ 0s .
"You were able to deli@@ ver do@@ cu@@ ments , were able to do it over net@@ works ."
We develop@@ ed a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ text mark@@ up language .
"And the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very large do@@ cu@@ men@@ tation systems over computer net@@ works ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les ne@@ ar Par@@ is in late No@@ ve@@ mber 199@@ 0 .
"And I was appro@@ ach@@ ed by a ni@@ ce young man called T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ chi@@ e ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide We@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pre@@ t@@ enti@@ ous name , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally since the whole system ran on his computer in his of@@ fi@@ ce ."
But he was completely con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that his Wor@@ ld W@@ ide We@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tried to per@@ su@@ a@@ de me to wr@@ ite the bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any grap@@ hi@@ cs or f@@ on@@ ts or lay@@ out or anything ; it was just pla@@ in text ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ text community didn &apos;t reco@@ gn@@ ize him e@@ ither ."
"In 199@@ 2 , his p@@ aper was re@@ je@@ cted for the H@@ y@@ per@@ text Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the con@@ fer@@ ence in Se@@ at@@ tle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ sen was de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ting his little bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide We@@ b ."
"And I saw it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the con@@ fer@@ ence here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and I had no op@@ posi@@ tion in having T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e as the ke@@ y@@ n@@ ote spe@@ ak@@ er ."
So that pu@@ ts me in pretty il@@ lu@@ stri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ic@@ k Ro@@ we who was at De@@ c@@ ca Re@@ cor@@ ds and turned down The Be@@ at@@ les .
"There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went f@@ lying his plan@@ e when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an oper@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see B@@ ill G@@ a@@ tes ."
"And the 12 publi@@ sh@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . Ro@@ w@@ ling &apos;s Har@@ ry P@@ ot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ sen who wr@@ ote the world &apos;s first bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide We@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to F@@ ort@@ un@@ e ma@@ gaz@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 7@@ 00 million dollars ."
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"In 199@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and I met a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y who had been tor@@ tu@@ red and was den@@ i@@ ed ac@@ cess to coun@@ sel ."
"And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundre@@ ds of let@@ ters I had wr@@ it@@ ten for political pri@@ son@@ ers , that I would never have wr@@ it@@ ten a let@@ ter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body ."
He was not a political pri@@ son@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y who had st@@ ol@@ en a bi@@ cy@@ cle .
"What I also realized at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 1@@ 3 develop@@ ing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all pas@@ sed la@@ ws that say you have a right to a la@@ w@@ yer and you have a right not to be tor@@ tu@@ red ."
And what I reco@@ gn@@ ized was that there was an incredi@@ ble win@@ do@@ w of opport@@ unity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol .
"We often think of tor@@ ture as being political tor@@ ture or re@@ ser@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for political pri@@ son@@ ers ."
"It is for people who are in bro@@ ken@@ -@@ down le@@ g@@ al systems , and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tion — it &apos;s che@@ aper than having a le@@ g@@ al system , che@@ aper than having a la@@ w@@ yer and early ac@@ cess to coun@@ sel — it is what happens most of the time ."
"I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a deci@@ sion , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol in our li@@ fe@@ time , but it will re@@ qu@@ ire three things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is the tra@@ ining , emp@@ o@@ wer@@ ment , and conne@@ ction of def@@ en@@ ders wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is syste@@ ma@@ tic early ac@@ cess to coun@@ sel .
And the third is comm@@ it@@ ment .
"So in the year 2@@ 000 , I began to won@@ der , what if we came together ?"
C@@ ould we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I f@@ oun@@ ded In@@ ter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce which has a speci@@ fic mis@@ sion of en@@ ding tor@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol and imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting du@@ e process ri@@ ghts in the 9@@ 3 countries by pla@@ cing tra@@ ined la@@ w@@ yer@@ s at an early st@@ age in poli@@ ce sta@@ tions and in cour@@ tro@@ o@@ ms .
"My first experi@@ ences , though , did come from C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and at the time I remember first coming to C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ mer R@@ ou@@ ge had kil@@ led them all ."
"And even 20 years later , there was only 10 la@@ w@@ yer@@ s in the country , so con@@ sequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a pri@@ son and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old boy@@ s , you &apos;d me@@ et women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ o@@ men would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and comm@@ it@@ ted a cri@@ me , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w ."
"The first group of def@@ en@@ ders came together and I still remember , as I was tra@@ ining , I said , &quot; O@@ kay , what do you do for an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tion ? &quot;"
"And there was sil@@ ence in the cla@@ ss , and finally one woman sto@@ od up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; te@@ ac@@ her . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ en@@ ded more than a hun@@ d@@ red people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tion , because they all come with con@@ f@@ es@@ sions . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a cla@@ ss , the fact that number one , the con@@ f@@ es@@ sions might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the poli@@ ce to keep doing this , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally as it was now against the la@@ w ."
And it took a lot of cou@@ ra@@ ge for these def@@ en@@ ders to deci@@ de that they would be@@ gin to stand up and supp@@ ort each other in imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting these la@@ ws .
"And I still remember the first cas@@ es where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would supp@@ ort her , and the ju@@ d@@ ges ke@@ pt saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the ex@@ act same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the per@@ fect case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ ge@@ table sel@@ ler , she was si@@ tting outside of a house ."
"S@@ he said she actually saw the person run out who she thin@@ ks st@@ ole w@@ hatever the je@@ wel@@ ry was , but the poli@@ ce came , they got her , there was nothing on her ."
She was pre@@ gn@@ ant at the time . She had ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ car@@ ri@@ ed .
"And when they b@@ rought her case to the ju@@ dge , for the first time he sto@@ od up and he said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , there &apos;s no ev@@ iden@@ ce ex@@ cept for your tor@@ ture con@@ f@@ es@@ sion and you will be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And the def@@ en@@ ders began to take cas@@ es over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ."
But C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia is not al@@ one .
"I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ?"
O@@ r is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
"In B@@ ur@@ un@@ di I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son and it wasn &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mo@@ bile phone ."
"O@@ r a woman , I pic@@ ked up her bab@@ y , really cu@@ te bab@@ y , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our bab@@ y is so cu@@ te . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a bab@@ y , she was three ."
"And she said &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was ac@@ cu@@ sed of ste@@ al@@ ing two di@@ ap@@ ers and an ir@@ on for her bab@@ y and still had been in pri@@ son ."
"And when I wal@@ ked up to the pri@@ son dire@@ ctor , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out ."
"A ju@@ dge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , we can talk about it , but look at my pri@@ son . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thou@@ s@@ and people here are without a la@@ w@@ yer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ w@@ yer@@ s began to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously stand up together to organ@@ ize a system where they can take cas@@ es ."
"But we realized that it &apos;s not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ yer@@ s , but the conne@@ ction of the la@@ w@@ yer@@ s that makes a difference ."
"For example , in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go al@@ one but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ w@@ yer@@ s with her who sto@@ od up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a f@@ res@@ h w@@ ind in the de@@ ser@@ t when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a pri@@ son where everybody sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , e@@ ight years , 12 years without a la@@ w@@ yer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tra@@ ining together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mu@@ mb@@ lin@@ g@@ "
"@@ and gru@@ mb@@ ling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create ju@@ sti@@ ce because we do not have the resour@@ ces . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the la@@ ck of resour@@ ces is never an ex@@ c@@ use for in@@ ju@@ sti@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And with that , he suc@@ cess@@ ful@@ ly organiz@@ ed 6@@ 8 la@@ w@@ yer@@ s who have been syste@@ ma@@ tically taking the cas@@ es ."
"The key that we see , though , is tra@@ ining and then early ac@@ cess ."
"I was re@@ cen@@ tly in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , and was in@@ spi@@ red to me@@ et with another group of la@@ w@@ yer@@ s , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have poli@@ ce on the stre@@ ets now . The poli@@ ce are one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we had the re@@ v@@ olution . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been ten@@ s of mil@@ lions of dollars that have re@@ cen@@ tly gone in to the develop@@ ment of the le@@ g@@ al system here ."
"What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the develop@@ ment a@@ gen@@ ci@@ es , and they were tra@@ ining pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ tors and ju@@ d@@ ges , which is the normal bi@@ as , as op@@ posed to def@@ en@@ ders ."
And they sho@@ wed me a man@@ ual which actually was an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent man@@ ual .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ on@@ na cop@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ yer@@ s can come at the poli@@ ce st@@ ation . It was per@@ fect ."
P@@ ros@@ ecu@@ tors were per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly tra@@ ined .
"But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ tor &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pa@@ use , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tu@@ red . &quot;"
"So the pi@@ e@@ ces are , not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ yer@@ s , but us fin@@ ding a way to syste@@ ma@@ tically imp@@ le@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ sel , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tu@@ red ."
"And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the fact that it s@@ ounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , o@@ kay , it s@@ ounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it s@@ ounds big ."
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of cre@@ ating mi@@ ra@@ c@@ les because of their comm@@ it@@ ment .
"It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but def@@ en@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pi@@ e@@ ces ."
"We have a program called J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we supp@@ ort them ?"
So it &apos;s an on@@ line con@@ test where it &apos;s only five thou@@ s@@ and dollars if you come up with and inno@@ va@@ tive way of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting ju@@ sti@@ ce .
"And there are 30 J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers throu@@ gh@@ out the world , from S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka to S@@ w@@ az@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thou@@ s@@ and dollars do amazing things , through S@@ M@@ S progra@@ ms , through par@@ al@@ e@@ g@@ al progra@@ ms , through w@@ hatever they can do ."
"And it &apos;s not only these J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their net@@ works are and how they can move it for@@ ward ."
"So in China , for in@@ stance , great la@@ ws came out where it says poli@@ ce cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be p@@ un@@ ish@@ ed ."
"And I was si@@ tting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous la@@ w@@ yer@@ s , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted ?"
"This is fan@@ tas@@ tic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s o@@ kay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on D@@ ece@@ mber 4 , he organiz@@ ed three thou@@ s@@ and me@@ mb@@ ers of the Y@@ outh C@@ om@@ m@@ uni@@ st Le@@ a@@ gue , from 1@@ 4 of the top la@@ w sch@@ o@@ ols , who organiz@@ ed themselves , develop@@ ed pos@@ ters with the new la@@ ws , and went to the poli@@ ce sta@@ tions and began what he says is a non@@ -@@ viol@@ ent le@@ g@@ al re@@ v@@ olution to prote@@ ct ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ri@@ ghts ."
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to tra@@ in and supp@@ ort def@@ en@@ ders .
We need to syste@@ ma@@ tically imp@@ le@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ sel .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a comm@@ it@@ ment to this .
"And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wil@@ dly ide@@ al@@ isti@@ c ."
"N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end sla@@ very , or end ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id ."
It began with a small group of people who decided they would com@@ mit .
"Now , there &apos;s one of our fav@@ or@@ ite po@@ e@@ ms from the def@@ en@@ ders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; T@@ ake cou@@ ra@@ ge friends , the ro@@ ad is often long , the pat@@ h is never cle@@ ar , and the st@@ ak@@ es are very high , but de@@ ep down , you are not al@@ one . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to supp@@ ort not only def@@ en@@ ders , but also everyone in the system who is looking to@@ wards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ ol ."
"I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . F@@ ir@@ st of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ ish@@ na , who actually was my in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion for star@@ ting In@@ ter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce ."
"@@ V@@ ish@@ na was a 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y when I met him who was born in a C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ an pri@@ son in K@@ an@@ da@@ l Pro@@ v@@ ince . But because he was born in the pri@@ son , everybody lo@@ ved him , inclu@@ ding the gu@@ ar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was allo@@ wed to come in and out of the b@@ ars ."
"So , you know , there &apos;s b@@ ars . And by the time that V@@ ish@@ na was getting big@@ ger , which means what gets big@@ ger ? Y@@ our head gets big@@ ger ."
"So he would come to the first b@@ ar , the second b@@ ar and then the third b@@ ar , and then really s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly move his head so he could f@@ it through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my p@@ in@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go vi@@ sit ."
"You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to vi@@ sit all 1@@ 5@@ 6 pri@@ son@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his fin@@ gers through ."
"O@@ r if they were dar@@ k cells , it was like ir@@ on cor@@ ru@@ ga@@ ted , and he would put his fin@@ gers through ."
"And most of the pri@@ son@@ ers said that he was their gre@@ a@@ test jo@@ y and their sun@@ sh@@ ine , and they looked for@@ ward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ ish@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y ."

But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
"And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I th@@ ank you for having the pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic ima@@ gin@@ ation to imagine the shap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and inv@@ ite you into this jour@@ ney with us ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"H@@ i , it &apos;s Jo@@ e . I &apos;m working from home today ."
And even b@@ l@@ ind ba@@ bi@@ es sm@@ ile to the sound of the human vo@@ ice .
&quot; S@@ h@@ are a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od story . &quot;
&quot; Di@@ v@@ ul@@ ge a person@@ al se@@ cre@@ t . &quot;
&quot; E@@ nd with an in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing call to action . &quot;
No .
"But there is one thing that all great TED T@@ al@@ ks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a r@@ ing@@ side se@@ at , list@@ en@@ ing to many hundre@@ ds of amazing TED spe@@ ak@@ ers , like these ."
"And even though these spe@@ ak@@ ers and their top@@ ic@@ s all see@@ m completely different , they actually do have one key common in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent ."
And it &apos;s this : Y@@ our number one tas@@ k as a spe@@ ak@@ er is to trans@@ fer into your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds an extra@@ ordin@@ ary gi@@ ft — a st@@ range and beautiful obje@@ ct that we call an idea .
"( Applause ) O@@ ver the course of 18 minutes , 1@@ ,@@ 200 people , many of wh@@ om have never seen each other before , are fin@@ ding that their bra@@ ins are star@@ ting to sy@@ n@@ c with H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain and with each other ."
There &apos;s something even more star@@ t@@ ling happening .
Let &apos;s take a look inside H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are bil@@ lions of inter@@ conne@@ cted neur@@ ons in an im@@ possible tan@@ gle .
"But look here , right here — a few million of them are lin@@ ked to each other in a way which re@@ presen@@ ts a single idea ."
"And incredi@@ bly , this ex@@ act patter@@ n is being re@@ created in real time inside the min@@ ds of everyone list@@ en@@ ing ."
"That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a patter@@ n inv@@ ol@@ ving mil@@ lions of neur@@ ons is being tele@@ por@@ ted into 1@@ ,@@ 200 min@@ ds , just by people list@@ en@@ ing to a vo@@ ice and wat@@ ching a face ."
But wa@@ it — what is an idea any@@ way ?
"Well , you can think of it as a patter@@ n of information that hel@@ ps you understand and na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world ."
"I@@ de@@ as come in all shap@@ es and siz@@ es , from the comple@@ x and anal@@ y@@ tical to the simple and a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ."
Here are just a few exa@@ mp@@ les sh@@ ared from the TED st@@ age .
S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son — crea@@ tivity is key to our kids &apos; future .
"( Video ) S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son : My con@@ ten@@ tion is that crea@@ tivity now is as important in education as liter@@ ac@@ y , and we should tre@@ at it with the same st@@ at@@ us ."
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : E@@ lor@@ a Har@@ dy — building from b@@ am@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
"( Video ) E@@ lor@@ a Har@@ dy : It is gro@@ wing all around us , it &apos;s str@@ ong , it &apos;s ele@@ g@@ ant , it &apos;s ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ e-@@ resi@@ st@@ ant ."
CA : C@@ hi@@ ma@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e — people are more than a single iden@@ ti@@ ty .
"( Video ) C@@ hi@@ ma@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The single story crea@@ tes ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es , and the problem with ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are in@@ comple@@ te ."
"C@@ A : Y@@ our mind is te@@ e@@ ming with ideas , and not just ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly ."
They &apos;re car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly lin@@ ked together .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ cti@@ vely they form an amaz@@ ing@@ ly comple@@ x stru@@ cture that is your person@@ al wor@@ l@@ d@@ view .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s oper@@ ating system .
It &apos;s how you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world .
And it is built up out of mil@@ lions of individu@@ al ideas .
"So , for example , if one little comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that kit@@ ten@@ s are ad@@ or@@ able , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act like this ."
"So , it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous why the ideas that make up your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view are cru@@ cial ."
"You need them to be as reli@@ able as possible — a gu@@ ide , to the s@@ car@@ y but wonderful real world out there ."
"Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ ws can be dra@@ ma@@ tically different ."
"For example , how does your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view re@@ act when you see this image : ( Video ) D@@ ali@@ a Mo@@ ga@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?"
"&quot; &quot; A woman of fa@@ ith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exper@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a si@@ ster &quot; &quot; ?"
"O@@ r &quot; &quot; op@@ pres@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ in@@ was@@ h@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st &quot; &quot; ?"
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
"If communi@@ cated pro@@ per@@ ly , they &apos;re cap@@ able of chan@@ ging , for@@ ever , how someone thin@@ ks about the world , and shap@@ ing their ac@@ tions both now and well into the future ."
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful for@@ ce shap@@ ing human culture .
"I@@ de@@ as are comple@@ x things ; you need to sla@@ sh back your con@@ t@@ ent so that you can focu@@ s on the single idea you &apos;re most pas@@ sion@@ ate about , and give yourself a chan@@ ce to expla@@ in that one thing pro@@ per@@ ly ."
"You have to give con@@ text , share exa@@ mp@@ les , make it vi@@ vi@@ d ."
"So pic@@ k one idea , and make it the throu@@ gh@@ -@@ line run@@ ning through your entire talk , so that everything you say lin@@ ks back to it in some way ."
"T@@ w@@ o , give your list@@ en@@ ers a reason to care ."
"Be@@ fore you can start building things inside the min@@ ds of your audi@@ ence , you have to get their per@@ mis@@ sion to wel@@ come you in ."
And the ma@@ in to@@ ol to ac@@ hi@@ eve that ?
C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
S@@ tir your audi@@ ence &apos;s cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"U@@ se in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing , pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive questions to iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs expla@@ ining ."
"If you can re@@ ve@@ al a dis@@ conne@@ ction in someone &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ view , they &apos;ll feel the need to bri@@ dge that knowle@@ dge ga@@ p ."
"And once you &apos;ve s@@ par@@ ked that de@@ si@@ re , it will be so much eas@@ i@@ er to start building your idea ."
"Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of con@@ cep@@ ts that your audi@@ ence already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"You use the power of language to we@@ a@@ ve together con@@ cep@@ ts that already ex@@ ist in your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds — but not your language , their language ."
"Now , met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors can play a cru@@ cial r@@ ole in sho@@ wing how the pi@@ e@@ ces f@@ it together , because they re@@ ve@@ al the de@@ si@@ red shap@@ e of the patter@@ n , based on an idea that the list@@ en@@ er already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"For example , when J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer Kah@@ n wanted to expla@@ in the incredi@@ ble new bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ nolo@@ gy called C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word pro@@ cess@@ or to edi@@ t DNA ."
"C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R allo@@ ws you to cut and pas@@ te gene@@ tic information really eas@@ ily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vi@@ vi@@ d ex@@ plan@@ ation like that deli@@ ver@@ s a sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying a@@ ha moment as it s@@ n@@ ap@@ s into place in our min@@ ds ."
"F@@ our , here &apos;s the fin@@ al ti@@ p : M@@ ake your idea wor@@ th sh@@ aring ."
"B@@ y that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Wh@@ o does this idea ben@@ ef@@ it ? &quot;"
And I need you to be hon@@ est with the answer .
The audi@@ ence will see right through you .
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase re@@ call a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a movi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a son@@ g or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really lik@@ ed , and you anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted that re@@ action , you wa@@ i@@ ted for it , and it came back , and the person ha@@ ted it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ du@@ ction , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school ma@@ th ."
"I se@@ ll a produ@@ ct to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a los@@ ing pro@@ posi@@ tion ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would expe@@ ct no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s rate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call ma@@ th education in the U.@@ S@@ . today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak ma@@ th down into two ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with le@@ ad@@ ing co@@ e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ at@@ er than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really str@@ ong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ li@@ cation of ma@@ th pro@@ ce@@ s@@ ses to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th te@@ ac@@ her ."
"So first , five sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ms that you &apos;re doing ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your cla@@ ss@@ room ."
One is a la@@ ck of in@@ iti@@ a@@ tive ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your le@@ cture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five hands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ expla@@ in the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ dents la@@ ck per@@ sever@@ ance .
"They la@@ ck re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ e ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which des@@ cri@@ be@@ s 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ a@@ ger@@ ly looking for the for@@ m@@ ul@@ a to app@@ ly in that si@@ tu@@ ation .
This is really de@@ stru@@ ctive .
"Da@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ temp@@ or@@ ary dra@@ ma , sho@@ ws set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct , it shap@@ es the ne@@ ural pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expe@@ ct simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ res@@ olution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t res@@ ol@@ ve quickly ."
"You expe@@ ct si@@ t@@ com@@ -@@ siz@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a la@@ u@@ gh tra@@ ck ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and wel@@ l-@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s — particu@@ lar@@ ly mas@@ s@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s — te@@ ach ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and cal@@ ling it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physi@@ cs te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ li@@ es equ@@ ally to ma@@ th .
"N@@ o@@ ti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have exactly three pi@@ e@@ ces of information there , each of which will figure into a for@@ m@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the stu@@ dent will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in ad@@ van@@ ce ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ p@@ lu@@ s of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all a@@ gre@@ e that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the te@@ x@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ in@@ ging students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the pra@@ cti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out num@@ bers and twe@@ ak@@ ing the con@@ text a little bit ."
"And if the stu@@ dent still doesn &apos;t reco@@ gn@@ ize the st@@ am@@ p this was mol@@ ded from , it help@@ ful@@ ly expla@@ ins to you what sa@@ mple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ m@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physi@@ cs , just kno@@ wing how to de@@ co@@ de a te@@ x@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can dia@@ gn@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ f@@ ically in ma@@ th .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ l@@ op@@ e using a s@@ ki li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ yer@@ s , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ yer@@ s and , particu@@ lar@@ ly , how when they &apos;re comp@@ res@@ sed together and presen@@ ted to the stu@@ dent all at once , how that crea@@ tes this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll def@@ ine them here : You have the vis@@ ual .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical stru@@ cture , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , la@@ be@@ ls , poin@@ ts , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ ction is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ el@@ ling question , a comp@@ el@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gra@@ tu@@ la@@ ting our students for how well they can step over the small cra@@ cks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vis@@ ual , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : W@@ hi@@ ch se@@ ction is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ?"
And this star@@ ts conver@@ sa@@ tion because the vis@@ ual is created in such a way where you can def@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ su@@ s friend , in pa@@ ir@@ s , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ing , w@@ hatever ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we real@@ ize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lo@@ wer lef@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ o@@ ve the mi@@ d line .
"And we real@@ ize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ be@@ ls to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to def@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we real@@ ize it would be ni@@ ce to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ ar@@ row it down , speci@@ f@@ ically what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical stru@@ cture ."
"The ma@@ th ser@@ ves the conver@@ sa@@ tion , the conver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the ma@@ th ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cla@@ s@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ l@@ op@@ e , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , comp@@ ared to that — which one crea@@ tes that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my pra@@ cti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ inste@@ in , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the for@@ mu@@ lation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pra@@ cti@@ ce , in the U.@@ S@@ . here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the for@@ mu@@ lation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ el@@ ling ele@@ ments of problems like this from my te@@ x@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that supp@@ or@@ ts ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we eli@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents have to devel@@ op those , they have to for@@ mu@@ late those ."
And then no@@ ti@@ ce that all the information wr@@ it@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ stra@@ ctor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? Do@@ es the side of it matter ?"
Do@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ re@@ presen@@ ted question in ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so often see in te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ dents are looking at their wat@@ ches , rol@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ i@@ ted the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really f@@ un for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a conver@@ sa@@ tion about ma@@ th because someone else has the for@@ m@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the for@@ m@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stu@@ dent is on a level pla@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically and conver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted jo@@ ining the conver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put na@@ mes on the bo@@ ard , at@@ t@@ ach them to gu@@ es@@ ses , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve des@@ cri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s edi@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the movi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ or@@ e@@ tical mode@@ ls that always work out in the answer key in the back of a te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s edi@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s s@@ car@@ y to talk about sour@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ or@@ e@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pra@@ c@@ tical ."
"But those conver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , a@@ mon@@ g the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ p@@ ort some really f@@ un ga@@ mes with students who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ al@@ led with these vir@@ uses day one of the cla@@ ss .
"These are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally for@@ e@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a conver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so f@@ un ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted by ma@@ th , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what ma@@ th is ."
This has been a lot of f@@ un .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge ma@@ th teach@@ ers I talk to to use multi@@ media , because it br@@ ings the real world into your cla@@ ss@@ room in high res@@ olution and full col@@ or ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stu@@ dent in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion for that level pla@@ ying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in conver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ inste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less help@@ ful , because the te@@ x@@ t@@ book is help@@ ing you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tion , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less help@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th te@@ ac@@ her right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our front po@@ c@@ ket .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ ap , and the to@@ ols to di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ aper or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two we@@ eks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ si@@ ted saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good conver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g re@@ cen@@ tly : In a gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 ite@@ ms or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one ite@@ ms ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar mode@@ ling inv@@ olved in that was some good stuff for my cla@@ ss@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ o@@ od M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few we@@ eks later , which is just biz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y for your own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , w@@ hatever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a stu@@ dent , par@@ ent , te@@ ac@@ her , poli@@ cy mak@@ er , w@@ hatever — in@@ si@@ st on better ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produ@@ ced by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pla@@ stic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ ha@@ ck an@@ ten@@ na at@@ t@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a f@@ un little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and p@@ lu@@ mb@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a Bu@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ al@@ ile@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tele@@ s@@ cop@@ e to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary on the side of a gla@@ ss win@@ do@@ w in Sa@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
I was born and ra@@ i@@ sed in Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ though my family con@@ stan@@ tly stru@@ g@@ g@@ led against po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ gest of two in the family ."
But then the great fa@@ mine began in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My si@@ ster and I would go sear@@ ching for fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mid@@ night .
"I would wan@@ der the stre@@ ets sear@@ ching for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating chi@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hu@@ mili@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is hop@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness .
"For a hun@@ gr@@ y child , poli@@ tics and fre@@ e@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"O@@ n my n@@ in@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the he@@ av@@ in@@ ess in their he@@ ar@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ ans died of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
"In the same year , my mother dis@@ appe@@ ared one day , and then my si@@ ster told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ ince we had never been se@@ para@@ ted , and I thought we would be together for@@ ever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the big@@ gest mi@@ st@@ ake I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ."
I have not seen my mo@@ m or my si@@ ster since then .
"S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly , I became an or@@ ph@@ an and ho@@ me@@ less ."
"My da@@ ily life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a du@@ st@@ y piece of bre@@ ad in the tr@@ as@@ h .
But that is no way to survi@@ ve .
"I started to real@@ ize , be@@ g@@ ging would not be the solu@@ tion ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ le@@ g@@ al mark@@ ets .
"S@@ ome@@ times , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"On@@ ce , I even sp@@ ent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al mine , 3@@ 3 me@@ ters under@@ ground without any prote@@ ction for up to 1@@ 6 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans survi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from bit@@ ter c@@ old or hun@@ ger pa@@ ins , I hop@@ ed that , the next mor@@ ning , my si@@ ster would come back to w@@ ake me up with my fav@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hope ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , gr@@ and hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tr@@ as@@ h can had bre@@ ad , even though it u@@ su@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die ."
H@@ op@@ e ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of wa@@ iting for my si@@ ster &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I realized I couldn &apos;t survi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ris@@ k@@ y , but I would be ris@@ king my life e@@ ither way ."
"I could die of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tried to c@@ ross the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time to av@@ o@@ id being seen .
Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ an bor@@ der gu@@ ar@@ ds often sh@@ oo@@ t and k@@ ill people trying to c@@ ross the bor@@ der without per@@ mis@@ sion .
"@@ Ch@@ in@@ ese sol@@ di@@ ers will cat@@ ch and sen@@ d back Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ ans , where they face sev@@ ere p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment ."
"I decided to c@@ ross during the day , first because I was still a k@@ id and s@@ car@@ ed of the dar@@ k , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to c@@ ross during the day , I thought I might be able to c@@ ross without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 1@@ 6 years old .
"I thought things in China would be eas@@ i@@ er , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ a , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ri@@ ed about being ca@@ u@@ ght and s@@ ent back .
"B@@ y a mi@@ ra@@ cle , some months later , I met someone who was run@@ ning an under@@ ground sh@@ el@@ ter for Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ ans , and was allo@@ wed to live there and e@@ at re@@ gu@@ lar me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"L@@ at@@ er that year , an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st help@@ ed me es@@ cap@@ e China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of En@@ gli@@ sh , yet my social work@@ er told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ a , I was an F stu@@ dent ."
( Laughter ) And I bar@@ ely fin@@ ish@@ ed ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school .
And I remember I f@@ ou@@ ght in school more than once a day .
T@@ ex@@ t@@ book@@ s and the li@@ br@@ ary were not my pla@@ y@@ ground .
"My father tried very hard to mo@@ tiv@@ ate me into stu@@ d@@ ying , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"A@@ t one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it h@@ ur@@ t me de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , my level of mo@@ tiv@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he died ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my f@@ os@@ ter mother had made chi@@ c@@ ken w@@ ings for din@@ ner ."
"And during din@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pla@@ te , I saw the last chi@@ c@@ ken wing , that my f@@ os@@ ter father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him si@@ tting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words ."
Su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I reme@@ mb@@ er@@ ed my bi@@ ological father .
"My f@@ os@@ ter father &apos;s small act of love re@@ min@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hun@@ gr@@ y , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so su@@ ff@@ o@@ cated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation ."
"My only w@@ ish that night was to co@@ ok a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to hon@@ or him ."
And my answer was to pro@@ mi@@ se to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to hon@@ or his sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce .
"I took school ser@@ i@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I rece@@ i@@ ved an ac@@ ade@@ mic a@@ ward for ex@@ cel@@ len@@ ce , and made de@@ an &apos;s li@@ st from the first se@@ me@@ ster in high school ."
( Applause ) That chi@@ c@@ ken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ op@@ e is person@@ al . H@@ op@@ e is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
"In Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ a , I made it myself ."
H@@ op@@ e b@@ rought me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"My f@@ os@@ ter father at that din@@ ner gave me a dire@@ ction , and he mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted me and gave me a pur@@ p@@ ose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people help@@ ed me along the way to get here .
Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ ans are fi@@ gh@@ ting hard to survi@@ ve .
"They have to for@@ ce themselves to survi@@ ve , have hope to survi@@ ve , but they cannot make it without help ."
This is my messa@@ ge to you .
"H@@ a@@ ve hope for yourself , but also help each other ."
"L@@ i@@ fe can be hard for everyone , wh@@ er@@ ever you live ."
My f@@ os@@ ter father didn &apos;t in@@ t@@ end to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the s@@ mal@@ le@@ st act of love ."
"A piece of bre@@ ad can sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y your hun@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you bre@@ ad to keep you ali@@ ve ."
But I con@@ fi@@ den@@ tly believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also sa@@ ve another J@@ os@@ ep@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other J@@ os@@ e@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : J@@ os@@ ep@@ h , th@@ ank you for sh@@ aring that very person@@ al and speci@@ al story with us ."
"I know you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen your si@@ ster for , you said , it was almost exactly a deca@@ de , and in the off chan@@ ce that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opport@@ unity to sen@@ d her a messa@@ ge ."
J@@ os@@ ep@@ h K@@ im : In K@@ or@@ e@@ an ?
"A@@ H : You can do En@@ gli@@ sh , then K@@ or@@ e@@ an as well ."
"( Laughter ) J@@ K : O@@ kay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in K@@ or@@ e@@ an because I don &apos;t think I can make it without te@@ aring up ."
"N@@ una , it has been already 10 years that I ha@@ ven ’ t seen you ."
"I just wanted to say that I mi@@ ss you , and I love you , and ple@@ ase come back to me and st@@ ay ali@@ ve ."
"And I — o@@ h , g@@ os@@ h ."
I still ha@@ ven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
"I will live my life happ@@ ily and study hard until I see you , and I pro@@ mi@@ se I will not c@@ ry again ."
"( Laughter ) Y@@ es , I &apos;m just looking for@@ ward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."
And can I also make a small messa@@ ge to my mo@@ m ?
"A@@ H : S@@ ure , ple@@ ase ."
"@@ J@@ K : I ha@@ ven &apos;t sp@@ ent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pra@@ y for me and think about me ."
I just wanted to say th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a di@@ stor@@ ted sequ@@ ence of charac@@ ters like this ?
"H@@ ow many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ standing . So I inven@@ ted that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty fil@@ ling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was wr@@ it@@ ten to sub@@ mit the form mil@@ lions and mil@@ lions of times ."
"The reason it works is because humans , at least non@@ -@@ vis@@ u@@ al@@ ly@@ -@@ im@@ pa@@ i@@ red humans , have no tr@@ ou@@ ble read@@ ing these di@@ stor@@ ted squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly charac@@ ters , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as computer progra@@ ms simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ic@@ ket@@ ma@@ ster , the reason you have to ty@@ pe these di@@ stor@@ ted charac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent scal@@ per@@ s from wr@@ iting a program that can bu@@ y mil@@ lions of tic@@ ket@@ s , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ ci@@ se sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that is sho@@ wn to the us@@ er is not so for@@ tun@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o regi@@ stra@@ tion pa@@ ge .
"The ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that happened to be sho@@ wn to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word ."
But the best part is the messa@@ ge that the Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ex@@ t : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wa@@ iting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this po@@ or person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A Pro@@ je@@ ct is something that we did here at Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ el@@ l@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"L@@ et me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next ev@@ olution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ el@@ l@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the fol@@ lo@@ wing real@@ iz@@ ation : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are ty@@ p@@ ed every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite p@@ rou@@ d of myself ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my research has had ."
But then I started fe@@ eling bad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , essen@@ ti@@ ally you was@@ te 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you multi@@ p@@ ly that by 200 million , you get that human@@ ity as a whole is was@@ ting about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day ty@@ p@@ ing these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started fe@@ eling bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the se@@ cur@@ ity of the We@@ b sort of de@@ pen@@ ds on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this ef@@ for@@ t for something that is good for human@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re ty@@ p@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do u@@ se@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of pu@@ tting it is , is there some h@@ um@@ on@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get compu@@ ters to sol@@ ve , yet we can sp@@ li@@ t into tin@@ y 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they sol@@ ve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ wa@@ days while you &apos;re ty@@ p@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ enti@@ c@@ ating yourself as a human , but in ad@@ di@@ tion you &apos;re actually help@@ ing us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze book@@ s ."
So let me expla@@ in how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of proje@@ cts out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze book@@ s .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
"A@@ maz@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ dle , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze book@@ s ."
B@@ as@@ ically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? L@@ ik@@ e a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now s@@ can@@ ning a book is like taking a di@@ git@@ al photo@@ grap@@ h of every pa@@ ge of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every pa@@ ge of the book .
This is an image with text for every pa@@ ge of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ p@@ her all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical charac@@ ter reco@@ g@@ ni@@ tion , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not per@@ fect .
"E@@ speci@@ ally for ol@@ der book@@ s where the ink has fa@@ ded and the pa@@ ges have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R cannot reco@@ gn@@ ize a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were wr@@ it@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot reco@@ gn@@ ize about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot reco@@ gn@@ ize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ p@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ p@@ ing are actually words that are coming from book@@ s that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ed that the computer could not reco@@ gn@@ ize ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ wa@@ days instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , ple@@ ase ty@@ pe both ."
"And if you ty@@ pe the cor@@ re@@ ct word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it as@@ su@@ mes you are human , and it also gets some con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce that you ty@@ p@@ ed the other word cor@@ re@@ c@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them a@@ gre@@ e on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ed ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ si@@ tes have started s@@ wit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people was@@ ted their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are help@@ ing to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze book@@ s ."
"So for example , T@@ ic@@ ket@@ ma@@ ster ."
"So every time you bu@@ y tic@@ ket@@ s on T@@ ic@@ ket@@ ma@@ ster , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or p@@ ok@@ e somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ wit@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other si@@ tes are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of si@@ tes that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million book@@ s a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ p@@ ing C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ ny things can happen ."
And this is es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally true because now we &apos;re gi@@ ving people two ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en En@@ gli@@ sh words next to each other .
So fun@@ ny things can happen .
"For example , we presen@@ ted this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you present it along with another ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ex@@ t : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ site where we sho@@ wed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ bas@@ s@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of God ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Joh@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ex@@ t : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ sul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ sul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presen@@ ting two ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given ri@@ se to a really big Internet me@@ me that ten@@ s of thousands of people have parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ ma@@ gine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ex@@ t : in@@ vi@@ sible to@@ as@@ ter ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re su@@ p@@ posed to do is you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t , and then you dra@@ w something that is rela@@ ted to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very cu@@ te . ( T@@ ex@@ t : c@@ len@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ex@@ t : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like p@@ al@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ological sh@@ vis@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ op Do@@ g@@ g . ( Laughter )"
"O@@ kay , so this is my fav@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fav@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of di@@ st@@ in@@ ct people that have help@@ ed us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has help@@ ed us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowle@@ dge ."
And it is num@@ bers like these that mo@@ tiv@@ ate my research a@@ gen@@ da .
"So the question that mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tes my research is the fol@@ lo@@ wing : If you look at human@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ e@@ ments , these really big things that human@@ ity has g@@ ot@@ ten together and done hi@@ stor@@ ically — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or the P@@ an@@ ama C@@ an@@ al or pu@@ tting a man on the Mo@@ on — there is a cu@@ ri@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ird ; they were all done with about 10@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 10@@ 0,000 people , let al@@ one pay@@ ing them , was essen@@ ti@@ ally im@@ possible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you a project where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowle@@ dge ."
"So the question that mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tes my research is , if we can put a man on the Mo@@ on with 10@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different proje@@ cts that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most ex@@ ci@@ ted about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qui@@ et@@ ly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It has@@ n &apos;t yet been la@@ un@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ ince it has@@ n &apos;t been la@@ un@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Ye@@ ah , I can tru@@ st you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dent , Se@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s Se@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I posed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ re@@ c@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ la@@ ting the We@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , trans@@ la@@ ting the We@@ b ."
So right now the We@@ b is parti@@ tion@@ ed into multi@@ ple langu@@ a@@ ges .
A large fra@@ ction of it is in En@@ gli@@ sh .
"If you don &apos;t know any En@@ gli@@ sh , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"But there &apos;s large fra@@ ctions in other different langu@@ a@@ ges , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ a@@ ges , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ late all of the We@@ b , or at least most of the We@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to trans@@ late ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ lation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ lation no@@ wa@@ days is star@@ ting to trans@@ late some sen@@ ten@@ ces here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ late the whole We@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mi@@ st@@ ake , since it makes so many mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es , you don &apos;t know whether to tru@@ st it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ la@@ ted with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um p@@ ost .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ la@@ ted from Jap@@ an@@ ese into En@@ gli@@ sh .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts ap@@ ologi@@ z@@ ing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ la@@ ted with a computer .
So the next sen@@ t@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expla@@ ining something .
"@@ Re@@ me@@ mber , it &apos;s a question about J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time in@@ st@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ omi@@ t . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : How many times like the w@@ ind , a p@@ ole , and the dra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : This in@@ s@@ ult to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : P@@ le@@ ase ap@@ ologi@@ ze for your stu@@ pi@@ di@@ ty . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so computer trans@@ lation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ late the whole We@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?"
We could pay profes@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ la@@ tors to trans@@ late the whole We@@ b .
We could do that .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it would be extre@@ me@@ ly ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ la@@ ting a tin@@ y , tin@@ y fra@@ ction of the whole We@@ b , W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia , into one other language , S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia ex@@ ists in S@@ pan@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small comp@@ ared to the size of En@@ gli@@ sh ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of En@@ gli@@ sh .
"If we wanted to trans@@ late the other 80 percent into S@@ pan@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exp@@ lo@@ i@@ ted , out@@ sour@@ cing country out there ."
So it would be very ex@@ pen@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ la@@ ting the We@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly real@@ ize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big h@@ ur@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ."
The first one is a la@@ ck of bilin@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there ex@@ ists 100 million people out there using the We@@ b who are bilin@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ late .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a la@@ ck of mo@@ tiv@@ ation .
How are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate people to actually trans@@ late the We@@ b for free ?
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , you have to pay people to do this ."
So how are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were blo@@ c@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to sol@@ ve both these problems with the same solu@@ tion ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two bir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ lation into something that mil@@ lions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of la@@ ck of bilin@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people learning a for@@ e@@ ig@@ n language ."
"P@@ eople really , really want to learn a for@@ e@@ ig@@ n language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ ced to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States al@@ one , there are over five million people who have pa@@ id over $ 500 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ site — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the bas@@ ic idea is people learn a new language for free while sim@@ ul@@ tane@@ ously trans@@ la@@ ting the We@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a begin@@ ner , we give you very , very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces on the We@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ late them , and as you see how other people trans@@ late them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more ad@@ van@@ ced , we give you more and more comple@@ x sen@@ ten@@ ces to trans@@ late ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the cra@@ z@@ y thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re mos@@ tly done building it , and now we &apos;re te@@ sting it ."
P@@ eople really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the le@@ ad@@ ing language learning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real con@@ t@@ ent ."
"As op@@ posed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up sen@@ ten@@ ces , people are learning with real con@@ t@@ ent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ ners , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get are as ac@@ cu@@ rate as those of profes@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ la@@ tors , which is very surpri@@ sing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a sen@@ t@@ ence that was trans@@ la@@ ted from Ger@@ man into En@@ gli@@ sh .
The top is the Ger@@ man .
The middle is an En@@ gli@@ sh trans@@ lation that was done by somebody who was a profes@@ sion@@ al En@@ gli@@ sh trans@@ la@@ tor who we pa@@ id 20 cen@@ ts a word for this trans@@ lation .
"And the bot@@ to@@ m is a trans@@ lation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any Ger@@ man before they started using the site ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much per@@ fect ."
"Now of course , we play a tri@@ ck here to make the trans@@ la@@ tions as good as profes@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ la@@ tors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the trans@@ la@@ tions of multi@@ ple begin@@ ners to get the qu@@ ality of a single profes@@ sion@@ al trans@@ la@@ tor .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ bin@@ ing the trans@@ la@@ tions , the site actually can trans@@ late pretty f@@ ast ."
"So let me show you , this is our es@@ ti@@ ma@@ tes of how f@@ ast we could trans@@ late W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia from En@@ gli@@ sh into S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"@@ Re@@ me@@ mber , this is 50 million dol@@ lar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of value ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ late W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia into S@@ pan@@ ish , we could do it in five we@@ eks with 10@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ ince all the proje@@ cts that my group has worked on so far have g@@ ot@@ ten mil@@ lions of us@@ ers , we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ late extre@@ me@@ ly f@@ ast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most ex@@ ci@@ ted about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this pro@@ vide@@ s a fa@@ ir business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The cur@@ r@@ ent business model for language education is the stu@@ dent p@@ ays , and in particular , the stu@@ dent p@@ ays R@@ os@@ et@@ ta S@@ t@@ one 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the cur@@ r@@ ent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ fa@@ ir to@@ wards the po@@ or .
This is tot@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed to@@ wards the ri@@ ch .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating value , you &apos;re trans@@ la@@ ting stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ la@@ tions ."
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
"S@@ ince people are cre@@ ating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time ."
"But the ma@@ gi@@ cal thing here is that they &apos;re pay@@ ing with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been sp@@ ent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the ni@@ ce thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it pro@@ vide@@ s a fa@@ ir business model — one that doesn &apos;t dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ate against po@@ or people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our pri@@ v@@ ate be@@ ta , which is probably going to start in about three or four we@@ eks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really a@@ we@@ some team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .

"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a fan@@ tas@@ tic do@@ ctor , who was very unu@@ su@@ al , na@@ med A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art ."
"And A@@ li@@ ce was unu@@ su@@ al par@@ tly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty r@@ are in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ."
"And she was br@@ il@@ li@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ gest F@@ el@@ low to be ele@@ cted to the R@@ oy@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans ."
"S@@ he was unu@@ su@@ al too because she contin@@ u@@ ed to work after she got mar@@ ri@@ ed , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced and was a single par@@ ent , she contin@@ u@@ ed her medi@@ cal work ."
"And she was unu@@ su@@ al because she was really interested in a new science , the emer@@ ging field of ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology , the study of patter@@ ns in disease ."
"But like every scienti@@ st , she ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and sol@@ ve it ."
The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ris@@ ing in@@ ci@@ den@@ ce of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers .
"M@@ ost disease is cor@@ rela@@ ted with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the case of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers , the children who were d@@ ying see@@ med mos@@ tly to come from a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent famili@@ es ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could expla@@ in this an@@ o@@ mal@@ y ?"
"Now , A@@ li@@ ce had tr@@ ou@@ ble getting fun@@ ding for her research ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 p@@ ounds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ at@@ a M@@ e@@ mor@@ i@@ al pri@@ ze ."
And that me@@ ant she knew she only had one sho@@ t at colle@@ cting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a ne@@ ed@@ le in a hay@@ st@@ ac@@ k sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ aten bo@@ i@@ led s@@ we@@ ets ?
H@@ ad they consu@@ med col@@ or@@ ed dr@@ in@@ ks ?
D@@ id they e@@ at fish and chi@@ ps ?
D@@ id they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or p@@ lu@@ mb@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ bon cop@@ i@@ ed ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire started to come back , one thing and one thing only ju@@ mp@@ ed out with the sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal c@@ lar@@ ity of a kind that most scienti@@ sts can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mo@@ thers who had been X@@ -@@ ra@@ y@@ ed when pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
Now that fin@@ ding fle@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom .
"C@@ on@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom hel@@ d that everything was sa@@ fe up to a point , a thre@@ sh@@ old ."
"It fle@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom , which was huge en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m for the co@@ ol new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y machine ."
"And it fle@@ w in the face of do@@ c@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who help@@ ed pati@@ ents , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ e@@ ver@@ the@@ less , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art ru@@ shed to publi@@ sh her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ din@@ gs in The L@@ an@@ ce@@ t in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"P@@ eople got very ex@@ ci@@ ted , there was talk of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big h@@ ur@@ ry to try to study all the cas@@ es of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od cancer she could find before they dis@@ appe@@ ared ."
"In fact , she need not have h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed ."
It was ful@@ ly 25 years before the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh and medi@@ cal — B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh and American medi@@ cal est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ments ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed the pra@@ cti@@ ce of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ gn@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was d@@ ying , but nothing changed ."
O@@ pen@@ ness al@@ one can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art had a very big fi@@ ght on her hands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a fan@@ tas@@ tic model for thinking ."
"S@@ he worked with a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an na@@ med Ge@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ al@@ e , and Ge@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce wasn &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and Ge@@ or@@ ge was a re@@ cl@@ use ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic with her pati@@ ents ."
Ge@@ or@@ ge f@@ ran@@ kly pre@@ fer@@ red num@@ bers to people .
But he said this fan@@ tas@@ tic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r. S@@ te@@ w@@ art wrong . &quot; &quot; He ac@@ ti@@ vely s@@ ou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent ways of looking at her mode@@ ls , at her sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , different ways of c@@ run@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating con@@ fli@@ ct around her the@@ or@@ ies .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that Ge@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a fan@@ tas@@ tic model of col@@ labor@@ ation — thinking part@@ ners who ar@@ en &apos;t e@@ ch@@ o cha@@ mb@@ ers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and Ge@@ or@@ ge were very good at con@@ fli@@ ct .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ stru@@ ctive con@@ fli@@ ct re@@ qu@@ ire ?
"Well , first of all , it re@@ qui@@ res that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to resi@@ st the ne@@ uro@@ bi@@ ological dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ fer people mos@@ tly like ourselves , and it means we have to se@@ ek out people with different bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ounds , different dis@@ cip@@ lin@@ es , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to en@@ ga@@ ge with them ."
That re@@ qui@@ res a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you simply won &apos;t com@@ mit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ par@@ ed to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s da@@ u@@ ghter told me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went he@@ ad@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ head with a fel@@ low scienti@@ st , they made her think and think and think again ."
"&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it stri@@ kes me that the big@@ gest problems we face , many of the big@@ gest dis@@ as@@ ters that we &apos;ve experi@@ en@@ ced , mos@@ tly ha@@ ven &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organiz@@ ations , some of them big@@ ger than countries , many of them cap@@ able of af@@ fe@@ cting hundre@@ ds , thousands , even mil@@ lions of lives ."
So how do organiz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fli@@ ct .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Euro@@ pe@@ an and American ex@@ ecu@@ ti@@ ves , ful@@ ly 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issu@@ es or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ ra@@ id to ra@@ ise ."
"A@@ fra@@ id of the con@@ fli@@ ct that that would pro@@ v@@ ok@@ e , af@@ ra@@ id to get e@@ mb@@ ro@@ i@@ led in ar@@ gu@@ ments that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to l@@ ose ."
E@@ igh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organiz@@ ations mos@@ tly can &apos;t do what Ge@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ u@@ mp@@ han@@ tly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organiz@@ ations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mos@@ tly fa@@ il to get the best out of them ."
So how do we devel@@ op the s@@ kil@@ ls that we need ?
"Because it does take sk@@ ill and pra@@ cti@@ ce , too ."
"If we ar@@ en &apos;t going to be af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fli@@ ct , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , re@@ cen@@ tly , I worked with an ex@@ ecu@@ tive na@@ med Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medi@@ cal de@@ vice company ."
And Jo@@ e was very wor@@ ri@@ ed about the de@@ vice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too compli@@ cated and he thought that its comple@@ x@@ ity created mar@@ gin@@ s of er@@ ro@@ r that could really h@@ ur@@ t people .
He was af@@ ra@@ id of doing da@@ ma@@ ge to the pati@@ ents he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organiz@@ ation , no@@ body else see@@ med to be at all wor@@ ri@@ ed ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
M@@ ay@@ be he &apos;d look stu@@ p@@ id .
"But he ke@@ pt wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ri@@ ed about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , Jo@@ e and I found a way for him to ra@@ ise his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this si@@ tu@@ ation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
So now Jo@@ e had al@@ li@@ es . They could think together .
"And y@@ es , there was a lot of con@@ fli@@ ct and de@@ b@@ ate and ar@@ gu@@ ment , but that allo@@ wed everyone around the table to be crea@@ tive , to sol@@ ve the problem , and to change the de@@ vice ."
"But he had been so af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fli@@ ct , until finally he became more af@@ ra@@ id of the sil@@ ence ."
"And when he dar@@ ed to spe@@ ak , he disco@@ vered much more inside hi@@ m@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever ima@@ gin@@ ed ."
And his col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es don &apos;t think of him as a c@@ ran@@ k .
They think of him as a le@@ ad@@ er .
"So , how do we have these conver@@ sa@@ tions more eas@@ ily and more often ?"
"Well , the Uni@@ versity of D@@ el@@ ft re@@ qui@@ res that its P@@ h@@ D students have to sub@@ mit five sta@@ te@@ ments that they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to def@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the sta@@ te@@ ments are about , what mat@@ ters is that the can@@ di@@ da@@ tes are wil@@ ling and able to stand up to au@@ th@@ or@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a fan@@ tas@@ tic system , but I think lea@@ ving it to P@@ h@@ D can@@ di@@ da@@ tes is far too few people , and way too late in life ."
"I think we need to be teach@@ ing these s@@ kil@@ ls to kids and a@@ du@@ l@@ ts at every st@@ age of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organiz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the big@@ gest cat@@ as@@ tro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve wit@@ nes@@ sed r@@ are@@ ly come from information that is se@@ cre@@ t or hi@@ d@@ den .
"It comes from information that is fre@@ ely a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble and out there , but that we are wil@@ l@@ ful@@ ly b@@ l@@ ind to , because we can &apos;t han@@ dle , don &apos;t want to han@@ dle , the con@@ fli@@ ct that it pro@@ v@@ ok@@ es ."
"But when we d@@ are to bre@@ ak that sil@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create con@@ fli@@ ct , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ p@@ en information is fan@@ tas@@ tic , open net@@ works are essen@@ ti@@ al ."
But the tru@@ th won &apos;t set us free until we devel@@ op the s@@ kil@@ ls and the ha@@ bit and the tal@@ ent and the mor@@ al cou@@ ra@@ ge to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

Thank you .
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED st@@ age in A@@ ru@@ s@@ ha , Tan@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I sp@@ ok@@ e very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my p@@ rou@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"Be@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ ala@@ w@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"My En@@ gli@@ sh lost , I wanted to v@@ omi@@ t ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I w@@ ouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m fe@@ eling good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll si@@ ster@@ s , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my da@@ d when I was a little bo@@ y .
"Be@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of po@@ or far@@ mers ."
"L@@ ik@@ e everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ en@@ ced an aw@@ ful fa@@ mine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ ala@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
"My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
On@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ ala@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to pay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hun@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those dr@@ y fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to rece@@ ive education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read book@@ s , science book@@ s , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally physi@@ cs ."
I couldn &apos;t read En@@ gli@@ sh that well .
I used dia@@ gra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowle@@ dge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ ga@@ tion , a def@@ en@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ en@@ cing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a s@@ cra@@ p yar@@ d where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tra@@ ctor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"U@@ sing a bi@@ cy@@ cle fra@@ me and an old bi@@ cy@@ cle dy@@ na@@ m@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ches , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mode@@ led after an electri@@ c be@@ ll ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine pu@@ mp@@ s water for ir@@ ri@@ ga@@ tion .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ u@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bile phone .

"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to blo@@ g@@ gers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in A@@ ru@@ s@@ ha , my En@@ gli@@ sh lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afri@@ can@@ s , and the po@@ or who are stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with your dre@@ a@@ ms ."
God b@@ less .
M@@ ay@@ be one day you will wat@@ ch this on the Internet .

"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the communi@@ st E@@ as@@ ter@@ n Ger@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government ."
You had to regi@@ ster a sa@@ mple sh@@ e@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er .
And this was done so the government could tra@@ ck where text was coming from .
"If they found a p@@ aper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tra@@ ck down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a col@@ or la@@ s@@ er prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or la@@ s@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ er and pr@@ int a pa@@ ge , that pa@@ ge will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single pa@@ ge in a patter@@ n which makes the pa@@ ge uni@@ que to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body see@@ ms to be making a fu@@ ss about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s ."
And this is one of the ma@@ in three sour@@ ces of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the at@@ tac@@ ks based on the at@@ tac@@ k@@ ers ."
We have three ma@@ in grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als .
"L@@ ik@@ e here , we have M@@ r. D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine ."
And the mo@@ ti@@ ves of on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line at@@ tac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have sever@@ al cas@@ es of mil@@ li@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res on@@ line , multi@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res , who made money with their at@@ tac@@ ks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ s@@ as@@ t@@ sin form T@@ art@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ din .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ar@@ i@@ q Al@@ -@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on ."
"These guys make their for@@ tun@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ le@@ g@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ g@@ gers to colle@@ ct our cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ opp@@ ing from an in@@ fe@@ cted computer ."
"The U.@@ S@@ . Se@@ cre@@ t S@@ er@@ vice , two months ago , f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r. S@@ am J@@ a@@ in right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S@@ . dollars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en ."
M@@ r. J@@ a@@ in hi@@ m@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more lik@@ ely for any of us to become the v@@ ic@@ tim of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of at@@ tac@@ k@@ ers that we are wat@@ ching today are not mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted by money .
"They &apos;re mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted by something else — mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted by prot@@ est@@ s , mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted by an op@@ in@@ i@@ on , mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted by the la@@ u@@ gh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ y@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or pla@@ yer in the field of on@@ line at@@ tac@@ ks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in at@@ tac@@ k@@ ers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ on@@ y@@ mous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are n@@ ation sta@@ tes , govern@@ ments doing the at@@ tac@@ ks ."
And then we look at cas@@ es like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments at@@ tac@@ k against their own ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The Ne@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds — or actually , it was ."
It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were ha@@ c@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body bro@@ ke in and they ha@@ c@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ et@@ ing with D@@ ut@@ ch government re@@ presen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves , I asked one of the lea@@ ders of the team whether he found pla@@ u@@ sible that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck ."
And his answer was y@@ es .
So how do people die as the res@@ ult of a ha@@ ck like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They se@@ ll cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tes .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tes ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a we@@ b@@ site that has h@@ tt@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted serv@@ ices , serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors , but these serv@@ ices are es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally popu@@ lar in tot@@ al@@ it@@ ar@@ ian sta@@ tes like I@@ ran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use for@@ e@@ ig@@ n serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local serv@@ ices and they are en@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L conne@@ ctions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sions ."
E@@ x@@ cept they can if they ha@@ ck into a for@@ e@@ ig@@ n C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issu@@ e ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tes .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about Ara@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an se@@ cre@@ t poli@@ ce in Ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of p@@ ap@@ ers ."
"A@@ mon@@ g those p@@ ap@@ ers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in Ger@@ many which had s@@ old the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an government a set of to@@ ols for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communi@@ cation of the ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s of the country ."
"They had s@@ old this to@@ ol for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So We@@ ster@@ n govern@@ ments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ ar@@ ian govern@@ ments with to@@ ols to do this against their own ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s .
But We@@ ster@@ n govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in Ger@@ many , just a couple of we@@ eks ago the so@@ -@@ called S@@ t@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by Ger@@ man government off@@ ici@@ als to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate their own ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s ."
"If you are a su@@ spe@@ ct in a cri@@ min@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be t@@ app@@ ed ."
"But today , it goes be@@ yon@@ d that ."
They will ta@@ p your Internet conne@@ ction .
"They will even use to@@ ols like S@@ t@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to in@@ fect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ab@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communi@@ cation , to list@@ en to your on@@ line dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sions , to colle@@ ct your pas@@ s@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ ep@@ er about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that s@@ ounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really af@@ fect me because I &apos;m a le@@ g@@ al ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ gu@@ ment , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ vac@@ y is imp@@ li@@ ed .
P@@ ri@@ vac@@ y is not up for dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion .
This is not a question between pri@@ vac@@ y against se@@ cur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of fre@@ e@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tru@@ st our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tru@@ st , do we b@@ lin@@ dly tru@@ st , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ un@@ dan@@ e s@@ ounds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ yer ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) ( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to spe@@ ak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and ev@@ il and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ i@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to value ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stitu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gue that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ para@@ tion between science and human val@@ u@@ es is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a dan@@ ger@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion for mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ u@@ es see@@ m to bel@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ u@@ es are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the wel@@ l-@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atu@@ res .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ i@@ cal ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions to@@ ward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel comp@@ as@@ sion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ ff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ ma@@ tes than we are about in@@ se@@ cts , as inde@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ at@@ er range of pot@@ ential happ@@ in@@ ess and su@@ ff@@ ering ."
"Now , the cru@@ cial thing to no@@ ti@@ ce here is that this is a fac@@ tual cla@@ im : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ stru@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bi@@ ological comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bili@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ se@@ cts ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ u@@ es from reli@@ gi@@ on , even if you think that good and ev@@ il ulti@@ ma@@ tely rela@@ te to con@@ di@@ tions after death — e@@ ither to an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of happ@@ in@@ ess with God or an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of su@@ ff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after death is itself a fac@@ tual cla@@ im , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to spe@@ ak about the con@@ di@@ tions of wel@@ l-@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ i@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where st@@ ran@@ gers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ labor@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
Pro@@ bab@@ ly not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the ev@@ il eye , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bla@@ me their neigh@@ bor@@ s ? Pro@@ bab@@ ly not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human communi@@ ties f@@ l@@ ou@@ ris@@ h , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality rela@@ tes to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ u@@ es we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our si@@ tu@@ ation in the world can be under@@ sto@@ od at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and political ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human wel@@ l-@@ being we are , of ne@@ ce@@ s@@ si@@ ty , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — w@@ hatever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de bo@@ mber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produ@@ ct of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as inde@@ ed it does , it changes us by chan@@ ging our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore w@@ hatever cul@@ tu@@ ral vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings f@@ l@@ ou@@ ris@@ h can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be under@@ sto@@ od in the con@@ text of a ma@@ tur@@ ing science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ology , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that value &apos;s re@@ du@@ ced to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ ley@@ s that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the wel@@ l-@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atu@@ res , both person@@ al and colle@@ ctive ."
"And one thing to no@@ ti@@ ce is that perhaps there are sta@@ tes of human wel@@ l-@@ being that we r@@ are@@ ly ac@@ cess , that few people ac@@ cess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these sta@@ tes can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ sti@@ cal or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other sta@@ tes that we can &apos;t ac@@ cess because of how our min@@ ds are stru@@ c@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could ac@@ cess them .
"Now , let me be cle@@ ar about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stance , that you will one day con@@ s@@ ult a su@@ per@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bo@@ m@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar fac@@ ili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ du@@ ct the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions af@@ fect human wel@@ l-@@ being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this — just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how humans f@@ l@@ ou@@ ris@@ h — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stance , there are 2@@ 1 sta@@ tes in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment in the cla@@ ss@@ room is le@@ g@@ al , where it is le@@ g@@ al for a te@@ ac@@ her to be@@ at a child with a w@@ oo@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ i@@ ses and bli@@ ster@@ s and even bre@@ ak@@ ing the sk@@ in ."
"And hundre@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ den@@ t@@ ally , are sub@@ je@@ cted to this every year ."
"The lo@@ ca@@ tions of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ stri@@ cts , I think , will fa@@ il to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ cut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ al@@ e for this behavi@@ or is exp@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ly reli@@ gi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe hi@@ m@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , le@@ st we s@@ po@@ il the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spe@@ ak@@ ing , to sub@@ je@@ ct children to pa@@ in and viol@@ ence and public hu@@ mili@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging heal@@ thy emo@@ tional develop@@ ment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the no@@ tion of wel@@ l-@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ defin@@ ed , and see@@ min@@ g@@ ly per@@ pet@@ u@@ ally open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ stru@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an obje@@ ctive no@@ tion of wel@@ l-@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by anal@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physi@@ cal health ."
The con@@ cept of physi@@ cal health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this st@@ at@@ ue was car@@ ved the a@@ verage life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develop@@ ed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ d@@ dle with our gen@@ o@@ mes in such a way that not being able to run a m@@ ara@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found di@@ sa@@ bility .
P@@ eople will sen@@ d you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ di@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) No@@ ti@@ ce that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it vac@@ u@@ ous ."
The di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as cle@@ ar and con@@ sequ@@ ential as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ ti@@ ce is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mize human f@@ l@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why w@@ ouldn &apos;t this under@@ mine an obje@@ ctive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be temp@@ ted to ar@@ gue to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a range of materi@@ als that con@@ stitu@@ te heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a cle@@ ar di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not temp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a uni@@ ver@@ sal mor@@ ality would re@@ qu@@ ire mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mit of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by anal@@ o@@ gy , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mo@@ ments when los@@ ing your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en is a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mo@@ ments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a do@@ ma@@ in of per@@ fect obje@@ c@@ tivity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the posi@@ tion , gener@@ ally spe@@ ak@@ ing , of our in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the p@@ rou@@ d den@@ iz@@ en@@ s of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to for@@ ce their wi@@ ves and da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h ba@@ gs ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with len@@ g@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row bat@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they de@@ cl@@ ine the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ t@@ end that we know so little about human wel@@ l-@@ being that we have to be non@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pra@@ cti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ y we@@ aring of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar w@@ hatever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ y mean in a community where , when a gir@@ l gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first imp@@ ul@@ se , rather often , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of s@@ ha@@ me ?"
"@@ Ju@@ st let that fact det@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minu@@ te : Y@@ our da@@ u@@ ghter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ presen@@ ts a pe@@ ak of human f@@ l@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ fect solu@@ tion in our own society ."
"For in@@ stance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ stand almost any@@ where in the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"Now , gran@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qu@@ ire a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y to see something wrong with these ima@@ ges ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fle@@ ctive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ fect ex@@ pres@@ sion of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological b@@ alan@@ ce with re@@ spe@@ ct to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ outh and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ bab@@ ly not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ mes that re@@ presen@@ ts a place of better b@@ alan@@ ce ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
But the thing to no@@ ti@@ ce is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my per@@ spe@@ ctive , is that the only people who see@@ m to gener@@ ally a@@ gre@@ e with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions are reli@@ gi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an in@@ telli@@ g@@ ent anal@@ y@@ sis of the ca@@ uses and con@@ di@@ tion of human and anima@@ l wel@@ l-@@ being ."
"In fact , the en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce of reli@@ gi@@ on as a len@@ s through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ para@@ ted most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and anima@@ l su@@ ff@@ ering ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ sequ@@ ential issu@@ e .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a uni@@ ver@@ sal con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ ti@@ ce is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally se@@ cu@@ lar , ac@@ ade@@ mic , scienti@@ st ty@@ p@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we value differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ i@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stance the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ ama gets up every mor@@ ning medi@@ t@@ ating on comp@@ as@@ sion , and he thin@@ ks that help@@ ing other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l comp@@ on@@ ent of human happ@@ in@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed Bun@@ dy ; T@@ ed Bun@@ dy was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ du@@ cting and rap@@ ing and tor@@ tur@@ ing and kil@@ ling young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ i@@ on about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost We@@ ster@@ n in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tu@@ als look at this si@@ tu@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ ama to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed Bun@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real ar@@ gu@@ ment that pot@@ enti@@ ally fal@@ ls within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es cho@@ co@@ late , he lik@@ es van@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; No@@ ti@@ ce that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ ori@@ st .
"If you ask the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ sts around who is the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a physi@@ cs con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing the@@ ory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ son@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ ci@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing the@@ ory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed Bun@@ dy of str@@ ing the@@ ory .
( Laughter ) I w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any str@@ ing the@@ ory clu@@ b that would have me as a me@@ mber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ i@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a do@@ ma@@ in of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for knowle@@ dge to coun@@ t .
"H@@ ow have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al exper@@ ti@@ se , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ i@@ on has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ je@@ cts wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
Do@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physi@@ cs that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ nor@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ je@@ ct of human wel@@ l-@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ mit that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human f@@ l@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and mor@@ ality rela@@ tes to that do@@ ma@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and de@@ si@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to ne@@ ed@@ less human su@@ ff@@ ering ."
Ju@@ st ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between na@@ tions mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ stru@@ ctive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inven@@ ted ; it will always be eas@@ i@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It see@@ ms to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently obvi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ spe@@ ct and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in no@@ tions of human wel@@ l-@@ being than we can re@@ spe@@ ct or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the no@@ tions about how disease sp@@ re@@ ads , or in the sa@@ f@@ ety stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ din@@ gs and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must conver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ mit that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble materi@@ al there ."
"W@@ he@@ ther in this audi@@ ence or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , he@@ aring some of this , may well be doing the s@@ crea@@ min@@ g@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age see@@ ms to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women d@@ res@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h ba@@ gs ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ lim world , sp@@ ok@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ lim women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a ce@@ le@@ bra@@ tion of fe@@ mal@@ e speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a res@@ ult of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cated p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological view — &quot; that mal@@ e lu@@ st is not to be tru@@ s@@ ted . &quot;"
"I mean , can you en@@ ga@@ ge in a conver@@ sa@@ tion with that kind of woman without see@@ ming kind of cul@@ tu@@ ral im@@ peri@@ ali@@ st ?"
"S@@ am Har@@ r@@ is : Ye@@ ah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sen@@ t@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ lo@@ ck tic@@ king , but the question is : What is v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ y in a con@@ text where men have certain expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ ny h@@ at , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be free to v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily do w@@ hatever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are pla@@ ced under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ a@@ ger to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re we@@ aring a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that ?
"I think I under@@ sto@@ od you to say that you could re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one di@@ men@@ sion@@ al , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ int your picture of what rol@@ ling the c@@ lo@@ ck 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , b@@ alan@@ cing mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ mit that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward under@@ standing our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ ta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ mit that we are going to understand all of the posi@@ tive and ne@@ ga@@ tive qu@@ ali@@ ties of ourselves in much gre@@ at@@ er de@@ ta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand posi@@ tive social emo@@ tion like emp@@ a@@ thy and comp@@ as@@ sion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gene@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we be@@ gin to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to conver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my da@@ u@@ ghter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and wel@@ l-@@ edu@@ cated in the con@@ text of men who do de@@ si@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ olved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
D@@ o people love their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the res@@ ul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your in@@ st@@ inc@@ tive cur@@ r@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ du@@ l@@ o one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ text of a tru@@ ly de@@ lu@@ sion@@ al beli@@ ef system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a boy@@ friend , I ch@@ opp@@ ed his head off . And that was the most comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts ali@@ g@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be fe@@ eling the emo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about wel@@ l-@@ being in a lar@@ ger con@@ text ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man fe@@ eling ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then blo@@ wing hi@@ m@@ self up on a bu@@ s ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a conver@@ sa@@ tion I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."

( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a di@@ st@@ in@@ ct pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge to be here .

"O@@ n the other hand , I had pla@@ y@@ ed the viol@@ in my entire life ."
Mu@@ sic for me was more than a pas@@ sion . It was ob@@ ses@@ sion .

"P@@ la@@ ying for Na@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el , the music took on a de@@ ep@@ er me@@ an@@ ing , because now it was about communi@@ cation , a communi@@ cation where words fa@@ i@@ led , a communi@@ cation of a messa@@ ge that went de@@ ep@@ er than words , that regi@@ ster@@ ed at a fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally pri@@ mal level in Na@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el &apos;s p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e , yet came as a true mu@@ si@@ cal off@@ ering from me ."

"But in the end , it was Na@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el who sho@@ wed me that if I was tru@@ ly pas@@ sion@@ ate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the per@@ fect in@@ stru@@ ment to do it , that music was the bri@@ dge that conne@@ cted my world and his ."

"That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause )"
( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was sil@@ ent for 1@@ 7 years .
"And the first words that I sp@@ ok@@ e were in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , on the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay ."
And my family and friends had ga@@ ther@@ ed there to hear me spe@@ ak .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audi@@ ence , she ju@@ mp@@ ed up , &quot; H@@ al@@ le@@ lu@@ j@@ ah , Joh@@ n@@ ny ’ s talking ! &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I@@ ma@@ gine if you were qui@@ et for 1@@ 7 years and your mother was out in the audi@@ ence , say ."
"My da@@ d said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll expla@@ in that ."
But I turned around because I didn ’ t reco@@ gn@@ ize where my vo@@ ice was coming from .
"I ha@@ dn ’ t heard my vo@@ ice in 1@@ 7 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;"
"And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed ."
"And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , he really is cra@@ z@@ y . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this jour@@ ney ."
"And the jour@@ ney , I believe , is a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys ."
"E@@ ven though this one is kind of unu@@ su@@ al , I want you to think about your own jour@@ ney ."
"My jour@@ ney began in 19@@ 7@@ 1 when I wit@@ nes@@ sed two oil tan@@ k@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath the G@@ ol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of oil sp@@ il@@ led into the b@@ ay ."
It di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ hi@@ c@@ les .
That ’ s a big thing in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"And it was a big thing in my little community of P@@ o@@ int R@@ eyes Sta@@ tion in In@@ ver@@ ness , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , because there were only about 3@@ 50 people there in the win@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now ."
"And so when I came in and I started wal@@ king around , people — they just knew what was going on ."
"And people would dri@@ ve up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; Joh@@ n , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m wal@@ king for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re wal@@ king to make us look bad , right ?"
"You ’ re wal@@ king to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some tru@@ th to that , because I thought that if I started wal@@ king , everyone would fol@@ low ."
"Because of the oil , everybody tal@@ ked about the pol@@ l@@ lu@@ tion ."
"And so I ar@@ gu@@ ed with people about that , I ar@@ gu@@ ed and I ar@@ gu@@ ed ."
I called my parents up .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in c@@ ars . &quot; &quot; My da@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 1@@ 6 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then ."
They ’ re back in P@@ hi@@ la@@ de@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
"And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you w@@ ouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ thers are like that ."
"And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day I decided , because I ar@@ gu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop spe@@ ak@@ ing for just one day — one day — to give it a rest ."
And so I did .
I got up in the mor@@ ning and I didn ’ t say a word .
"And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began list@@ en@@ ing — in a long time ."
"And what I heard , it kind of di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed me ."
"Because what I used to do , when I thought I was list@@ en@@ ing , was I would list@@ en just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I st@@ opp@@ ed list@@ en@@ ing ."
"And in my mind , I just kind of ra@@ ced a@@ head and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ ish@@ ing up ."
And then I would la@@ un@@ ch in .
"Well , that just en@@ ded communi@@ cation ."
So on this first day I actually list@@ en@@ ed .
"And it was very sa@@ d for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning ."
I was 2@@ 7 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
"And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I pro@@ mi@@ sed myself for a year I would keep qui@@ et because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more ."
"So for a year I said I would keep qui@@ et , and then on my bir@@ th@@ day I would reas@@ se@@ ss what I had learned and maybe I would talk again ."
"Well , that la@@ s@@ ted 1@@ 7 years ."
"Now during that time — those 1@@ 7 years — I wal@@ ked and I pla@@ y@@ ed the ban@@ j@@ o and I pain@@ ted and I wr@@ ote in my jour@@ n@@ al , and I tried to study the environment by read@@ ing book@@ s ."
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
"I wal@@ ked up to A@@ sh@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on , where they were off@@ ering an environ@@ mental stu@@ dies de@@ gre@@ e ."
It ’ s only 500 mi@@ les .
"And I went into the Re@@ gi@@ stra@@ r ’ s of@@ fi@@ ce and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;"
I had a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper cli@@ pp@@ ing .
"&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?"
You don ’ t … ?
We have a speci@@ al program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
"And in those two years , I gra@@ du@@ ated with my first de@@ gre@@ e — a bac@@ hel@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ."
"And my father came out , he was so p@@ rou@@ d ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , we ’ re really p@@ rou@@ d of you son , but what are you going to do with a bac@@ hel@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ?"
"You don ’ t ri@@ de in c@@ ars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I pic@@ ked my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ k up again and I started wal@@ king ."
"I wal@@ ked all the way up to P@@ ort T@@ ow@@ n@@ sen@@ d , W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , where I built a w@@ oo@@ den bo@@ at , ro@@ de it across P@@ u@@ get S@@ ound and wal@@ ked across W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton &#91; to &#93; I@@ da@@ h@@ o and down to M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ la , M@@ on@@ tan@@ a ."
I had wr@@ it@@ ten the Uni@@ versity of M@@ on@@ tan@@ a two years ear@@ li@@ er and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I sho@@ wed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really help@@ ed me .
There are two stories in M@@ on@@ tan@@ a .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sig@@ n I used a lot .
"And they said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that . &quot; &quot; The dire@@ ctor of the program said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome back to@@ mor@@ row . &quot; &quot; He gave me 1@@ 50 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one cre@@ di@@ t ."
"You ’ re going to go to S@@ outh America , ar@@ en ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ ver@@ s and la@@ kes , the hy@@ dr@@ ological systems , S@@ outh America ."
So I did that .
"He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK Joh@@ n , now that you &apos;ve regi@@ ster@@ ed for that one cre@@ di@@ t , you can have a key to an of@@ fi@@ ce , you can ma@@ tri@@ cu@@ late — you ’ re ma@@ tri@@ cu@@ la@@ ting , so you can use the li@@ br@@ ary ."
"And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the profes@@ sor@@ s al@@ low you to go to cla@@ ss ."
"They ’ re going to sa@@ ve your gra@@ de , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can regi@@ ster for that cla@@ ss and they ’ ll give you the gra@@ de . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , they don ’ t do that in gra@@ du@@ ate sch@@ o@@ ols , I don ’ t think ."
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
"They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way ."
"And during that time , I actually ta@@ u@@ ght cla@@ s@@ ses without spe@@ ak@@ ing ."
I had 1@@ 3 students when I first wal@@ ked into the cla@@ ss .
"I expla@@ ined , with a friend who could inter@@ pre@@ t my sig@@ n language , that I was Joh@@ n Fran@@ c@@ is , I was wal@@ king around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me ."
All the students s@@ at around and they went ...
"( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the sch@@ edu@@ le , to see when they could get out ."
They had to take that cla@@ ss with me .
"T@@ w@@ o we@@ eks later , everyone was trying to get into our cla@@ ss ."
And I learned in that cla@@ ss — because I would do things like this ...
"@@ and they were all ga@@ ther@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about cle@@ ar cu@@ tting . &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , cle@@ ar cu@@ tting . &quot;"
"&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not cle@@ ar cu@@ tting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a han@@ d@@ saw . &quot;"
"&quot; Well , you can ’ t c@@ lear@@ cut with a ... &quot;"
"&quot; Y@@ es , you can cle@@ ar cut ... &quot;"
"&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about se@@ le@@ ctive for@@ est@@ ry . &quot;"
Now this was a dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion cla@@ ss and we were having a dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion .
"I just bac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of ke@@ pt the fi@@ sts from f@@ lying ."
"But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sig@@ n and they said things that I absolu@@ tely did not mean , but I should have ."
"And so what came to me is , if you were a te@@ ac@@ her and you were teach@@ ing , if you wer@@ en ’ t learning you probably wer@@ en ’ t teach@@ ing very well ."
And so I went on .
"My da@@ d came out to see me gra@@ du@@ ate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really p@@ rou@@ d of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving and start talking ."
"What are you going to do with a ma@@ ster ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I got my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ k and I went on to the Uni@@ versity of W@@ is@@ con@@ sin ."
I sp@@ ent two years there wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ il@@ ls .
No one was interested in oil sp@@ il@@ ls .
But something happened — E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z .
And I was the only one in the United States wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ il@@ ls .
My da@@ d came out again .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ri@@ de in c@@ ars , you don ’ t talk ."
"My si@@ ster said maybe I should leave you al@@ one , because you see@@ m to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ k again ."
"I put my ban@@ j@@ o on and I wal@@ ked all the way to the E@@ ast Co@@ ast , put my f@@ oo@@ t in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States ."
"And on Earth D@@ ay , 199@@ 0 — the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay — that ’ s when I began to spe@@ ak ."
"And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tre@@ e in the for@@ est fal@@ ling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?"
"And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me spe@@ ak ."
And that ’ s communi@@ cation .
And they also ta@@ u@@ ght me about list@@ en@@ ing — that they list@@ en@@ ed to me .
"And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the list@@ en@@ ing to each other ."
"@@ Re@@ ally , very important — we need to list@@ en to each other ."
"Well , my jour@@ ney ke@@ pt going on ."
"My da@@ d said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go ."
"I worked for the Co@@ as@@ t@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . Goo@@ d@@ will A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"I wr@@ ote re@@ gula@@ tions for the United States — I mean , I wr@@ ote oil sp@@ ill re@@ gula@@ tions ."
"@@ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; Joh@@ n , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;"
"&quot; Ye@@ ah , I want to make a difference . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; You just start wal@@ king e@@ ast ; get out of your car and just start wal@@ king e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , and sh@@ ut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bu@@ d@@ dy . &quot;"
"H@@ ow could that be , how could that be ?"
How could doing such a simple thing like wal@@ king and not talking make a difference ?
"Well , my time at the Co@@ ast G@@ u@@ ard was a really good time ."
"And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at and I sa@@ i@@ led down to the Car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an , and wal@@ ked through all of the is@@ lan@@ ds , and to V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a ."
"And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you ."
I started talking because I had stu@@ died environment .
"I ’ d stu@@ died environment at this forma@@ l level , but there was this in@@ forma@@ l level ."
"And the in@@ forma@@ l level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are ."
And environment changed from just being about tre@@ es and bir@@ ds and en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed species to being about how we tre@@ ated each other .
"Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we tre@@ at ourselves and how we tre@@ at each other ."
And so that ’ s the messa@@ ge that I had .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to sp@@ read that messa@@ ge . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , sa@@ i@@ led all the way through the Car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , I kind of worked on that bo@@ at — got to V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a and I started wal@@ king ."
"This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ri@@ de in mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ hi@@ c@@ les ."
"I was wal@@ king through E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — it &apos;s a pri@@ son to@@ wn , fa@@ mous pri@@ son , or in@@ fa@@ mous pri@@ son — in V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ ses@@ sed me , because this was not like me ."
"There I am , wal@@ king past the gu@@ ard g@@ ate and the gu@@ ard st@@ op@@ s and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ ap@@ or@@ te , pas@@ ap@@ or@@ te , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 1@@ 6 poin@@ ted at me ."
"And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ sp@@ ort , hu@@ h ?"
I don &apos;t need to show you my pas@@ sp@@ ort . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ac@@ k .
I &apos;m D@@ r. Fran@@ c@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or and I &apos;m wal@@ king around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started wal@@ king off .
What pos@@ ses@@ sed me to say this thing ?
The ro@@ ad turned into the j@@ un@@ gle .
I didn ’ t get sho@@ t .
"And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — th@@ ank God Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?"
"It took me 100 mi@@ les to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pri@@ son@@ er ."
I was a pri@@ son@@ er and I needed to es@@ cap@@ e .
The pri@@ son that I was in was the fact that I did not dri@@ ve or use mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ hi@@ c@@ les .
Now how could that be ?
"Because when I started , it see@@ med very appro@@ pri@@ ate to me not to use mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ hi@@ c@@ les ."
"But the thing that was different was that every bir@@ th@@ day , I asked myself about sil@@ ence , but I never asked myself about my deci@@ sion to just use my feet ."
I had no idea I was going to become a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or .
I had no idea I would have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ .
"And so I realized that I had a respon@@ si@@ bility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change ."
"You know , we can do it ."
I was going to have to change .
"And I was af@@ ra@@ id to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just wal@@ ked ."
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
"I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today ."
"And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve g@@ ot@@ ten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go ."
"And we kind of have to leave behind the se@@ cur@@ ity of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are be@@ coming ."
"And so , I want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any pri@@ son that you might find yourself in , as com@@ for@@ table as it may be , because we have to do something now ."
We have to change now .
"As our for@@ mer V@@ ice P@@ resi@@ dent said , we have to become ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts ."
"So if my vo@@ ice can tou@@ ch you , if my ac@@ tions can tou@@ ch you , if my being here can tou@@ ch you , ple@@ ase let it be ."
And I know that all of you have tou@@ ched me while I ’ ve been here .
"So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this re@@ spe@@ ct that we ’ ve sho@@ wn each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world ."
"Because we are the environment , and how we tre@@ at each other is really how we ’ re going to tre@@ at the environment ."
So I want to th@@ ank you for being here and I want to end this in five secon@@ ds of sil@@ ence .
Thank you .

The first house ever built on a blo@@ ck is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s easy .

"And the solu@@ tion I off@@ er is to the big@@ gest cul@@ pri@@ t in this mas@@ sive mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of the ear@@ th by human@@ kind , and the res@@ ul@@ ting de@@ cl@@ ine of the bi@@ osp@@ here ."
"That cul@@ pri@@ t is business and indu@@ stry , which happens to be where I have sp@@ ent the last 5@@ 2 years since my gra@@ du@@ ation from Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a Te@@ ch in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"As an indu@@ stri@@ al engine@@ er , cu@@ m as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing and then suc@@ cess@@ ful en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur ."
"A@@ f@@ ter f@@ oun@@ ding my company , In@@ ter@@ face , from s@@ cra@@ t@@ ch in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 3@@ 6 years ago , to produ@@ ce car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ les in America for the business and in@@ stitu@@ tion mark@@ ets , and sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and survi@@ v@@ al to pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity and global do@@ min@@ ance in its field , I read P@@ au@@ l Ha@@ w@@ ken &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ c@@ ology of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the su@@ m@@ mer of 199@@ 4 ."
"In his book , P@@ au@@ l char@@ ges business and indu@@ stry as , one , the maj@@ or cul@@ pri@@ t in ca@@ using the de@@ cl@@ ine of the bi@@ osp@@ here , and , two , the only in@@ stitu@@ tion that is large enough , and per@@ v@@ as@@ ive enough , and powerful enough , to really le@@ ad human@@ kind out of this me@@ ss ."
And by the way he con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted me as a p@@ l@@ under@@ er of the ear@@ th .
"And I then challen@@ ged the people of In@@ ter@@ face , my company , to le@@ ad our company and the entire indu@@ stri@@ al world to su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , which we defin@@ ed as ev@@ en@@ tually oper@@ ating our pet@@ rol@@ e@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company in such a way as to take from the ear@@ th only what can be ren@@ e@@ wed by the ear@@ th , nat@@ ur@@ ally and rap@@ id@@ ly — not another f@@ res@@ h dro@@ p of oil — and to do no har@@ m to the bi@@ osp@@ here ."
T@@ ake nothing : do no har@@ m .

"U@@ n@@ less somebody lea@@ ds , no@@ body will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a@@ x@@ i@@ o@@ ma@@ tic . Why not us ?"
"And th@@ an@@ ks to the people of In@@ ter@@ face , I have become a reco@@ ver@@ ing p@@ l@@ under@@ er ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ ort@@ un@@ e Ma@@ gaz@@ ine wr@@ it@@ er that some@@ day people like me would go to j@@ a@@ il .
And that became the he@@ ad@@ line of a F@@ ort@@ un@@ e ar@@ tic@@ le .
They went on to des@@ cri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ rom p@@ l@@ under@@ er to reco@@ ver@@ ing p@@ l@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , f@@ ran@@ kly , was a pretty sa@@ d com@@ men@@ tar@@ y on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."
"A@@ s@@ ked later in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an do@@ cu@@ men@@ tar@@ y , &quot; &quot; The C@@ or@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I me@@ ant by the &quot; &quot; go to j@@ a@@ il &quot; &quot; re@@ mar@@ k , I off@@ er@@ ed that the@@ ft is a cri@@ me ."
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cri@@ me .
"But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cri@@ me — there must be a cle@@ ar , de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ble al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive to the tak@@ e-@@ ma@@ ke@@ -@@ was@@ te indu@@ stri@@ al system that so do@@ min@@ a@@ tes our ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , and is the maj@@ or cul@@ pri@@ t , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by di@@ g@@ ging up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to produ@@ cts that quickly become was@@ te in a lan@@ d@@ f@@ ill or an inc@@ in@@ er@@ at@@ or — in sh@@ ort , di@@ g@@ ging up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to pol@@ lu@@ tion ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a wel@@ l-@@ known environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation , imp@@ act — a bad thing — is the produ@@ ct of population , a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , imp@@ act is gener@@ ated by people , what they consu@@ me in their a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ence , and how it is produ@@ ced ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is lar@@ ge@@ ly sub@@ je@@ ctive , you can perhaps qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y people , and perhaps qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ u@@ sive in too many ways to qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y ."
So the equ@@ ation is con@@ cep@@ tual .
S@@ ti@@ ll it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at In@@ ter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ pe@@ t , a pet@@ rol@@ e@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive produ@@ ct for materi@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our technologi@@ es so they di@@ min@@ ish@@ ed environ@@ mental imp@@ act , rather than multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : population , a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted In@@ ter@@ face to re@@ wr@@ ite that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vi@@ ded by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ cal@@ ly@@ -@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the n@@ u@@ mer@@ at@@ or incre@@ ases imp@@ act — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ o@@ min@@ at@@ or de@@ cre@@ ases imp@@ act ."
"So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the n@@ u@@ mer@@ at@@ or — call it T@@ 1 — where it incre@@ ases imp@@ act , to the den@@ o@@ min@@ at@@ or — call it T@@ 2 — where it re@@ du@@ ces imp@@ act ?"
"I thought about the charac@@ ter@@ isti@@ cs of first indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution , T@@ 1 , as we pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed it at In@@ ter@@ face , and it had the fol@@ lo@@ wing charac@@ ter@@ isti@@ cs ."
E@@ x@@ tra@@ ctive : taking ra@@ w materi@@ als from the ear@@ th .

M@@ ore car@@ pe@@ t per man@@ -@@ h@@ our .
"Th@@ in@@ king it through , I realized that all those at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes must be changed to move T to the den@@ o@@ min@@ at@@ or ."
"In the new indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution extra@@ ctive must be re@@ pla@@ ced by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able ; lin@@ e@@ ar by cy@@ cli@@ cal ; f@@ os@@ sil fu@@ el energy by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , sun@@ light ; was@@ te@@ ful by was@@ te@@ -@@ free ; and ab@@ u@@ sive by ben@@ ig@@ n ; and la@@ b@@ or produ@@ c@@ tivity by resour@@ ce produ@@ c@@ tivity ."
"And I reas@@ on@@ ed that if we could make those trans@@ forma@@ tive changes , and get ri@@ d of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could re@@ du@@ ce our imp@@ act to zer@@ o , inclu@@ ding our imp@@ act on the cli@@ mate ."
"And that became the In@@ ter@@ face pla@@ n in 199@@ 5 , and has been the pla@@ n ever since ."
We have meas@@ u@@ red our pro@@ gre@@ ss very ri@@ gor@@ ously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as e@@ mis@@ sions down 8@@ 2 percent in absolu@@ te ton@@ na@@ ge .
( Applause ) O@@ ver the same sp@@ an of time sal@@ es have incre@@ as@@ ed by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds and prof@@ its have d@@ ou@@ b@@ led .
So an 8@@ 2 percent absolu@@ te re@@ du@@ ction trans@@ la@@ tes into a 9@@ 0 percent re@@ du@@ ction in gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as in@@ ten@@ si@@ ty rela@@ tive to sal@@ es .
This is the ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de of the re@@ du@@ ction the entire global tech@@ n@@ osp@@ here must real@@ ize by 20@@ 50 to av@@ o@@ id cat@@ as@@ tro@@ p@@ hi@@ c cli@@ mate dis@@ rup@@ tion — so the scienti@@ sts are telling us .

"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We re@@ ck@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : zer@@ o imp@@ act , zer@@ o fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."

We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to big@@ ger prof@@ its ."
Here is the business case for su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
"F@@ rom real life experience , cos@@ ts are down , not up , re@@ fle@@ cting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of av@@ o@@ ide@@ d cos@@ ts in pur@@ su@@ it of zer@@ o was@@ te — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."

"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing In@@ ter@@ face plan@@ s , would that sol@@ ve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I re@@ ma@@ in tr@@ ou@@ b@@ led by the re@@ vi@@ sed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vi@@ ded by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , sug@@ ge@@ sting that a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fra@@ med E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a lo@@ wer@@ case &apos; a , &apos; sug@@ ge@@ sting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ in@@ ess — more happ@@ in@@ ess with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ fra@@ me ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economi@@ cs , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that suc@@ ce@@ eds us : the su@@ sta@@ in@@ able species , living on a fin@@ ite ear@@ th , e@@ th@@ ically , happ@@ ily and ec@@ ologi@@ cally in b@@ alan@@ ce with nature and all her natural systems for a thou@@ s@@ and gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the inde@@ fin@@ ite future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to wa@@ it for our ex@@ tin@@ ction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"A@@ t In@@ ter@@ face we really in@@ t@@ end to bring this prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pi@@ cal su@@ sta@@ in@@ able , zer@@ o-@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int indu@@ stri@@ al company ful@@ ly into ex@@ ist@@ ence by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , cle@@ ar to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the challenge is in ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vis@@ er A@@ mor@@ y Lo@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something ex@@ ists , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a pet@@ ro@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
"And if any@@ body can , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that everybody can ."
"H@@ aw@@ ken ful@@ fil@@ led business and indu@@ stry , le@@ ad@@ ing human@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with contin@@ u@@ ed un@@ che@@ c@@ ked de@@ cl@@ ine of the bi@@ osp@@ here , a very de@@ ar person is at risk here — f@@ ran@@ kly , an un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table risk ."
Wh@@ o is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ tain cli@@ m@@ b .
"O@@ n a T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opport@@ unity back then , br@@ in@@ ging them along and often not kno@@ wing whether I was conne@@ cting ."
"But about five days later back in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , I rece@@ i@@ ved an e@@ ma@@ il from G@@ len@@ n Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s , one of my people in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a me@@ et@@ ing ."
He was sen@@ ding me an ori@@ gin@@ al po@@ e@@ m that he had comp@@ os@@ ed after our T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting mo@@ ments of my life .
"Because it told me , by God , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ len@@ n wr@@ ote . And here is that person , most at risk ."
"P@@ le@@ ase me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ mor@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , T@@ o@@ mor@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ n ."
A wi@@ se friend in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced us two .
"And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ aten you ."
"T@@ o@@ mor@@ row &apos;s child , my da@@ u@@ ghter , son , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;ve just be@@ g@@ un to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"Be@@ gin , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I squ@@ an@@ der , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ mor@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d &quot; &quot; has sp@@ ok@@ en to me with one simple but pro@@ found messa@@ ge , which I pre@@ su@@ me to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the we@@ b of life ."
"The contin@@ u@@ um of human@@ ity , sure , but in a lar@@ ger sense , the we@@ b of life itself ."
"And we have a cho@@ ice to make during our bri@@ ef , bri@@ ef vi@@ sit to this beautiful b@@ lue and gre@@ en living planet : to h@@ ur@@ t it or to help it ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
Thank you .
