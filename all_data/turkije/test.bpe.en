"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ ar@@ ly a billion people on this planet that ac@@ ti@@ vely use social net@@ working si@@ tes ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"Wh@@ ile that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions that are wor@@ th exp@@ lor@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g p@@ ost au@@ th@@ or@@ ed ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ erek K@@ . M@@ il@@ ler , who was a science and technology jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st who died of cancer ."
And what M@@ il@@ ler did was have his family and friends wr@@ ite a p@@ ost that went out sh@@ ort@@ ly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wr@@ ote in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last p@@ ost to my blo@@ g ."
"In ad@@ van@@ ce , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ un@@ ish@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this pre@@ par@@ ed messa@@ ge I wr@@ ote — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ site to an archi@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , M@@ il@@ ler &apos;s archi@@ ve may have been better wr@@ it@@ ten and more car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly cu@@ ra@@ ted than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an archi@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few st@@ at@@ s for a moment .
R@@ ight now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ a@@ ded to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minu@@ te .
There are 200 million T@@ we@@ ets being pos@@ ted every day .
And the a@@ verage F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 9@@ 0 pi@@ e@@ ces of con@@ t@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your gran@@ d@@ parents , at best they may have created some photo@@ s or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a bo@@ x some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly ri@@ ch di@@ git@@ al archi@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d inde@@ fin@@ i@@ tely , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opport@@ uni@@ ties for technologi@@ sts .
"Now to be cle@@ ar , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st and not a technologi@@ st , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ ef@@ ly is pa@@ int a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some serv@@ ices that are desig@@ ned to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line prof@@ ile and our social media ac@@ coun@@ ts after we die .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ tin@@ g@@ ly enough , found me when I che@@ c@@ ked into a de@@ li at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ squ@@ are ."
( Re@@ cor@@ ding ) A@@ dam O@@ st@@ row : H@@ el@@ l@@ o .
De@@ ath : A@@ dam ?
A@@ O : Ye@@ ah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : De@@ ath can cat@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the Or@@ gan@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
De@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
"( Laughter ) A@@ dam O@@ st@@ row : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that ser@@ vice does , quite simply , is let you create a messa@@ ge or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther ser@@ vice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ e@@ mor@@ ies ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ bu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with photo@@ s and vide@@ os and stories that they can p@@ ost after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably famili@@ ar with De@@ b Ro@@ y who , back in Mar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted how he was able to anal@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ u@@ es to im@@ pro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to anal@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of con@@ t@@ ent — the T@@ we@@ ets , the photo@@ s , the vide@@ os , the blo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produ@@ cing in such mas@@ sive num@@ bers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our di@@ git@@ al person@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone th@@ an@@ ks to the v@@ as@@ t@@ ness of the amount of con@@ t@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One ser@@ vice called My N@@ ex@@ t T@@ we@@ et anal@@ y@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some predi@@ ctions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the res@@ ul@@ ts can be some@@ what co@@ mi@@ cal ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our tech@@ ni@@ cal cap@@ a@@ bili@@ ties im@@ pro@@ ve ."
"T@@ ak@@ ing it a step f@@ ur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media la@@ b is working on robot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those robot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ que charac@@ ter@@ isti@@ cs of a speci@@ fic person based on the hundre@@ ds of thousands of pi@@ e@@ ces of con@@ t@@ ent that person produ@@ ces in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fa@@ mous s@@ cen@@ e from ele@@ ction night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ a@@ med a live h@@ olo@@ gra@@ m of hi@@ p ho@@ p arti@@ st wil@@ l@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son Co@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same ty@@ pe of technology to be@@ am a re@@ presen@@ tation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ o@@ ms — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fe@@ like way based on all the con@@ t@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produ@@ cing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both exp@@ and exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in clos@@ ing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a defin@@ i@@ tion of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organiz@@ ation &apos;s science ad@@ vis@@ or .
"I really , really lo@@ ved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was fe@@ eling just a little bit dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged ."
So I wan@@ der@@ ed down the hal@@ l@@ way to my col@@ lea@@ gue Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had de@@ ep in@@ stitu@@ tional knowle@@ dge and in@@ si@@ ghts ."
I expla@@ ined to Ch@@ r@@ is that I was fe@@ eling a little bit stu@@ ck .
I had been inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ating a number of issu@@ es at the inter@@ se@@ ction of science and ci@@ vi@@ l li@@ ber@@ ties — su@@ per interesting .
"But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to en@@ ga@@ ge these issu@@ es in a much big@@ ger way , in a way that could really make a difference ."
"So Ch@@ r@@ is cut right to the ch@@ ase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issu@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s gene@@ tic dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , and re@@ produ@@ ctive technologi@@ es , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ..."
"@@ o@@ h , there &apos;s this really co@@ ol issu@@ e , fun@@ c@@ tional M@@ R@@ I and using it for li@@ e de@@ te@@ ction , and ..."
"@@ o@@ h , and of course , there &apos;s gen@@ e pat@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents ? &quot;"
"&quot; Y@@ es , you know , pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the U@@ S government has been issu@@ ing pat@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my of@@ fi@@ ce and s@@ ent Ch@@ r@@ is three ar@@ tic@@ les .
"And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ sting in my of@@ fi@@ ce ."
&quot; Oh my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Wh@@ o can we su@@ e ? &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now Ch@@ r@@ is is a really br@@ il@@ li@@ ant la@@ w@@ yer , but he knew almost nothing about pat@@ ent la@@ w and cer@@ tain@@ ly nothing about gene@@ tics ."
"I knew something about gene@@ tics , but I wasn &apos;t even a la@@ w@@ yer , let al@@ one a pat@@ ent la@@ w@@ yer ."
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could f@@ ile a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we needed to understand exactly what was pat@@ en@@ ted when someone pat@@ en@@ ted a gen@@ e ."
"G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents ty@@ pic@@ ally con@@ tain do@@ zen@@ s of cla@@ im@@ s , but the most con@@ tro@@ versi@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; is@@ ola@@ ted DNA &quot; &quot; — na@@ me@@ ly , a piece of DNA that has been re@@ mo@@ ved from a cell ."
"And the pat@@ ents wer@@ en &apos;t just to a particular gen@@ e that they is@@ ola@@ ted , but on every possible ver@@ sion of that gen@@ e ."
So what does that mean ?
"That means that you can &apos;t give your gen@@ e to your do@@ ctor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mu@@ ta@@ tions , without per@@ mis@@ sion of the pat@@ ent hol@@ der ."
It also means that the pat@@ ent hol@@ der has the right to stop any@@ one from using that gen@@ e in research or c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal te@@ sting .
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , a 10@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old with long Q@@ T sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , a ser@@ i@@ ous heart con@@ di@@ tion that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can res@@ ult in su@@ d@@ den death ."
The company that ob@@ ta@@ ined a pat@@ ent on two gen@@ es as@@ soci@@ ated with this con@@ di@@ tion develop@@ ed a test to dia@@ gn@@ ose the sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t and they never off@@ er@@ ed it .
"So another la@@ b tried to off@@ er the test , but the company that hel@@ d the pat@@ ents thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to su@@ e the la@@ b for pat@@ ent inf@@ r@@ in@@ ge@@ ment ."
"So as a res@@ ult , for 2 years , no test was a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing that time , A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il died of un@@ dia@@ gn@@ os@@ ed long Q@@ T ."
G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ ming pati@@ ents .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
"T@@ ur@@ ns out that the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made cle@@ ar through a long line of cas@@ es , that certain things are not pat@@ ent eli@@ gi@@ ble ."
"You can &apos;t pat@@ ent produ@@ cts of nature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , ele@@ ments of the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table ."
"And you can &apos;t pat@@ ent la@@ ws of nature — the la@@ w of gra@@ v@@ ity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 ."
These things are just too fun@@ da@@ mental and must re@@ ma@@ in free to all and re@@ ser@@ ved ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely to n@@ one .
"It see@@ med to us that DNA , the most fun@@ da@@ mental stru@@ cture of life , that co@@ des for the produ@@ ction of all of our prote@@ ins , is both a produ@@ ct of nature and a la@@ w of nature , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s in our bo@@ dies or si@@ tting in the bot@@ to@@ m of a test tu@@ be ."
"M@@ ost of them a@@ gre@@ ed that we were right as a matter of poli@@ cy , and , at least in the@@ ory , as a matter of la@@ w ."
All of them thought our chan@@ ces of win@@ ning a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent challenge were about zer@@ o .
Why is that ?
"Well , the pat@@ ent of@@ fi@@ ce had been issu@@ ing these pat@@ ents for more than 20 years ."
There were liter@@ ally thousands of pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es .
"The pat@@ ent b@@ ar was de@@ ep@@ ly en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched in the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o , the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch indu@@ stry had gro@@ wn up around this pra@@ cti@@ ce , and le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation to b@@ an gen@@ e pat@@ ents had been in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced year after year in Con@@ gre@@ ss , and had gone absolu@@ tely no@@ where ."
So the bot@@ to@@ m line : cour@@ ts just wer@@ en &apos;t going to be wil@@ ling to over@@ turn these pat@@ ents .
"Now , ne@@ ither Ch@@ r@@ is n@@ or I were the ty@@ pe to sh@@ y away from a challenge , and he@@ aring , &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; see@@ med all the more reason to take on this fi@@ ght ."
So we set out to build our case .
"Now , pat@@ ent cas@@ es t@@ end to be : Co@@ mp@@ any A su@@ es Co@@ mp@@ any B over some really n@@ ar@@ row , ob@@ s@@ c@@ ure tech@@ ni@@ cal issu@@ e ."
"We wer@@ en &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much big@@ ger than that ."
"This was about scienti@@ fic fre@@ e@@ dom , medi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss , the ri@@ ghts of pati@@ ents ."
So we decided we were going to devel@@ op a case that was not like your ty@@ pi@@ cal pat@@ ent case — more like a ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts case .
We set out to iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent hol@@ der that was vi@@ gor@@ ously en@@ for@@ cing its pat@@ ents and then to organ@@ ize a bro@@ ad co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts that could tell the cour@@ t about all the ways that these pat@@ ents were har@@ ming pati@@ ents and inno@@ v@@ ation .
"We found the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ da@@ te to su@@ e in M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad G@@ ene@@ tics , a company that &apos;s based in S@@ al@@ t L@@ ake C@@ ity , U@@ ta@@ h ."
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad hel@@ d pat@@ ents on two gen@@ es , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 gen@@ es ."
W@@ o@@ men with certain mu@@ ta@@ tions along these gen@@ es are consi@@ der@@ ed to be at a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly incre@@ as@@ ed risk of develop@@ ing bre@@ ast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had used its pat@@ ents to ma@@ in@@ tain a comple@@ te mon@@ op@@ ol@@ y on B@@ R@@ CA te@@ sting in the United States .
It had for@@ ced multi@@ ple la@@ b@@ s that were off@@ ering B@@ R@@ CA te@@ sting to stop .
"It char@@ ged a lot of money for its test — over 3@@ ,000 dollars ."
"And perhaps wor@@ st of all , for a peri@@ od of sever@@ al years , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad re@@ fu@@ sed to up@@ da@@ te its test to inclu@@ de ad@@ di@@ tional mu@@ ta@@ tions that had been iden@@ ti@@ fied by a team of re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in Fran@@ ce ."
"It has been es@@ ti@@ ma@@ ted that during that peri@@ od , for sever@@ al years , as many as 12 percent of women under@@ going te@@ sting rece@@ i@@ ved the wrong answer — a ne@@ ga@@ tive test res@@ ult that should have been posi@@ tive ."
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en Ma@@ x@@ ian .
K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster E@@ ile@@ en develop@@ ed bre@@ ast cancer at age 40 and she was te@@ s@@ ted by M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was ne@@ ga@@ tive .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
"That me@@ ant that E@@ ile@@ en &apos;s cancer most lik@@ ely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other me@@ mb@@ ers of her family didn &apos;t need to be te@@ s@@ ted ."
"But two years later , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en was dia@@ gn@@ os@@ ed with ad@@ van@@ ce@@ d-@@ st@@ age o@@ vari@@ an cancer ."
It turned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster was a@@ mon@@ g the 12 percent who rece@@ i@@ ved a fal@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ ga@@ tive test res@@ ult .
"H@@ ad E@@ ile@@ en rece@@ i@@ ved the pro@@ per res@@ ult , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en would have then been te@@ s@@ ted , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
"On@@ ce we se@@ tt@@ led on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad , we then had to form a co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts that could il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate these problems ."
"We en@@ ded up with 20 high@@ ly comm@@ it@@ ted pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s : gene@@ tic coun@@ sel@@ ors , gene@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts who had rece@@ i@@ ved ce@@ ase and de@@ si@@ st let@@ ters , ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ac@@ y organiz@@ ations , four maj@@ or scienti@@ fic organiz@@ ations that colle@@ cti@@ vely re@@ presen@@ ted more than 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 scienti@@ sts and medi@@ cal profes@@ sion@@ als , and individu@@ al women who e@@ ither couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s test , or who wanted to ob@@ tain a second op@@ in@@ i@@ on but could not , as a res@@ ult of the pat@@ ents ."
One of the maj@@ or challen@@ ges we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was fig@@ ur@@ ing out how best to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate the science .
"So in order to ar@@ gue that what M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did was not an inven@@ tion , and that is@@ ola@@ ted B@@ R@@ CA gen@@ es were produ@@ cts of nature , we had to expla@@ in a couple of bas@@ ic con@@ cep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gen@@ e ? What &apos;s DNA ?"
"H@@ ow is DNA is@@ ola@@ ted , and why isn &apos;t that an inven@@ tion ?"
"We sp@@ ent hours and hours with our pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts , trying to come up with ways of expla@@ ining these con@@ cep@@ ts simply yet ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely ."
"And we en@@ ded up re@@ lying he@@ av@@ ily on the use of met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors , like g@@ old ."
So is@@ ola@@ ting DNA — it &apos;s like extra@@ cting g@@ old from a m@@ oun@@ tain or taking it out of a stre@@ am bed .
"You might be able to pat@@ ent the process for min@@ ing the g@@ old , but you can &apos;t pat@@ ent the g@@ old itself ."
"It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and ef@@ for@@ t to di@@ g the g@@ old out of the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you still can &apos;t pat@@ ent it , it &apos;s still g@@ old ."
"And the g@@ old , once it &apos;s extra@@ cted , can c@@ lear@@ ly be used for all sor@@ ts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you can make je@@ wel@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t pat@@ ent the g@@ old , it &apos;s still g@@ old ."
"So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to f@@ ile our case ."
"We fi@@ led in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ ist@@ ri@@ ct of New York , and the case was ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned to Ju@@ dge Ro@@ ber@@ t S@@ we@@ et ."
"In Mar@@ ch 20@@ 10 , Ju@@ dge S@@ we@@ et issu@@ ed his op@@ in@@ i@@ on — 1@@ 5@@ 2 pa@@ ges — and a comple@@ te v@@ ic@@ tor@@ y for our side ."
"In read@@ ing the op@@ in@@ i@@ on , we could not get over how el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently he des@@ cri@@ bed the science in the case ."
"I mean , our bri@@ ef — it was pretty good , but not this good ."
We just could not comp@@ re@@ h@@ end how this had happened .
"So it turned out , Ju@@ dge S@@ we@@ et &apos;s c@@ ler@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a la@@ w@@ yer — he was a scienti@@ st ."
He was not just a scienti@@ st — he had a P@@ h@@ D in mol@@ ecu@@ lar bi@@ ology .
( Laughter ) What an incredi@@ ble st@@ ro@@ ke of lu@@ ck !
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ eder@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ wit@@ ched si@@ des ."
So in the di@@ stri@@ ct cour@@ t the government sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted a bri@@ ef on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
"But now in dire@@ ct op@@ posi@@ tion to its own pat@@ ent of@@ fi@@ ce , the U@@ S government fi@@ les a bri@@ ef that sta@@ tes that is has re@@ consi@@ der@@ ed this issu@@ e in light of the di@@ stri@@ ct cour@@ t &apos;s op@@ in@@ i@@ on , and has con@@ clu@@ ded that is@@ ola@@ ted DNA is not pat@@ ent eli@@ gi@@ ble ."
"This was a really big deal , tot@@ ally un@@ expe@@ cted ."
"The C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ eder@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it he@@ ars all pat@@ ent cas@@ es , and it has a re@@ pu@@ tation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ pat@@ ent ."
"So even with this re@@ mark@@ able develop@@ ment , we expe@@ cted to l@@ ose ."
And we did .
S@@ ort of .
"E@@ n@@ ds up sp@@ li@@ t deci@@ sion , 2 to 1 ."
"But the two ju@@ d@@ ges who ru@@ led against us , did so for completely different reas@@ ons ."
"The first one , Ju@@ dge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own no@@ vel , bi@@ ological the@@ ory — tot@@ ally wrong ."
( Laughter ) He decided M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had created a new chemi@@ cal — made absolu@@ tely no sense .
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even ar@@ gue this , so it came out of the b@@ lue ."
"The other , Ju@@ dge Mo@@ ore , said she basically a@@ gre@@ ed with us that is@@ ola@@ ted DNA is a produ@@ ct of nature ."
"But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ ha@@ ke up the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch indu@@ stry . &quot; &quot; The third , Ju@@ dge B@@ r@@ y@@ son , a@@ gre@@ ed with us ."
So now we s@@ ou@@ ght re@@ view by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"And when you pe@@ ti@@ tion the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to present a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to answer ."
"U@@ su@@ ally these questions take the form of a su@@ per@@ -@@ long para@@ grap@@ h , like a whole pa@@ ge long with lots and lots of cla@@ uses , &quot; wh@@ er@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; ther@@ e@@ fore that . &quot;"
We sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted perhaps the sh@@ or@@ test question presen@@ ted ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human gen@@ es pat@@ en@@ table ?
"Now when Ch@@ r@@ is first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know ."
"I want the ju@@ sti@@ ces to have the very same re@@ action that I had when you b@@ rought this issu@@ e to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly couldn &apos;t ar@@ gue with that ."
"The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only he@@ ars about one percent of the cas@@ es that it rece@@ i@@ ves , and it a@@ gre@@ ed to hear ours ."
"The day of the or@@ al ar@@ gu@@ ment ar@@ ri@@ ves , and it was really , really ex@@ c@@ iting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the mor@@ ning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se ."
"T@@ w@@ o bre@@ ast cancer organiz@@ ations , B@@ re@@ ast C@@ an@@ cer A@@ ction and F@@ O@@ R@@ C@@ E , had organiz@@ ed a de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion on the cour@@ thou@@ se ste@@ ps ."
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
"But any re@@ ma@@ ining pan@@ ic sub@@ si@@ ded as I wal@@ ked into the cour@@ tro@@ om and looked around at a se@@ a of fri@@ en@@ dly fac@@ es : our individu@@ al women cli@@ ents who had sh@@ ared their de@@ ep@@ ly person@@ al stories , the gene@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their bu@@ s@@ y car@@ e@@ ers to de@@ di@@ c@@ ate themselves to this fi@@ ght and re@@ presen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves from a di@@ verse ar@@ ra@@ y of medi@@ cal , pati@@ ent ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ac@@ y , environ@@ mental and reli@@ gi@@ ous organiz@@ ations , who had sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted friend of the cour@@ t bri@@ ef@@ s in the case ."
"A@@ l@@ so in the room were three lea@@ ders of the H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome Pro@@ je@@ ct , inclu@@ ding the co@@ -@@ disco@@ ver@@ er of DNA hi@@ m@@ self , J@@ a@@ mes W@@ at@@ son , who had sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted a bri@@ ef to the cour@@ t , where he re@@ fer@@ red to gen@@ e pat@@ en@@ ting as &quot; &quot; l@@ un@@ ac@@ y . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The di@@ versity of the communi@@ ties re@@ presen@@ ted in this room and the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions each had made to make this day a reality sp@@ ok@@ e v@@ olu@@ mes to what was at st@@ ake ."
The ar@@ gu@@ ment itself was ri@@ v@@ et@@ ing .
Ch@@ r@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed br@@ il@@ li@@ an@@ tly .
J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce K@@ a@@ gan lik@@ en@@ ed is@@ ola@@ ting DNA to extra@@ cting a medi@@ cin@@ al plan@@ t from the A@@ maz@@ on .

"&quot; &quot; A nat@@ ur@@ ally oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing DNA se@@ g@@ ment is a produ@@ ct of nature , and not pat@@ en@@ t-@@ eli@@ gi@@ ble mer@@ ely because it has been is@@ ola@@ ted ."
"And f@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ in 2@@ 4 hours of the deci@@ sion , five la@@ b@@ s had an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that they would be@@ gin to off@@ er te@@ sting for the B@@ R@@ CA gen@@ es ."
S@@ ome of them pro@@ mi@@ sed to off@@ er the te@@ sts at a lo@@ wer pri@@ ce than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
S@@ ome pro@@ mi@@ sed to provi@@ de a more comp@@ re@@ hen@@ sive test than the one M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad was off@@ ering .
But of course the deci@@ sion goes far be@@ yon@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It ends a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year pra@@ cti@@ ce of allo@@ wing pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es in the United States .
It cle@@ ars a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant bar@@ ri@@ er to bi@@ o@@ medi@@ cal disco@@ very and inno@@ v@@ ation .
"And it hel@@ ps to en@@ sure that pati@@ ents like A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en and E@@ ile@@ en have ac@@ cess to the te@@ sts that they need ."
"A few we@@ eks after the cour@@ t issu@@ ed its deci@@ sion , I rece@@ i@@ ved a small p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge in the ma@@ il ."
"It was from B@@ o@@ b Co@@ ok@@ -@@ De@@ e@@ gan , a profes@@ s@@ or at D@@ u@@ ke Uni@@ versity and one the very first people Ch@@ r@@ is and I went to vi@@ sit when we started to consi@@ der whether to bring this case ."
I open@@ ed it up to find a small stu@@ ff@@ ed anima@@ l .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
P@@ art of what gave us the cou@@ ra@@ ge to take that risk was kno@@ wing that we were doing the right thing .
"The process took ne@@ ar@@ ly e@@ ight years from the start to fin@@ ish , with many tw@@ ists and turns along the way ."
"A little lu@@ ck cer@@ tain@@ ly help@@ ed , but it was the communi@@ ties that we bri@@ d@@ ged , the al@@ li@@ an@@ ces that we created , that made pi@@ gs f@@ ly ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through gli@@ mp@@ ses of about e@@ ight of my proje@@ cts , done in col@@ labor@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish arti@@ st S@@ or@@ en P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to be@@ gin with my very first obje@@ ct , which I call &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was in@@ spi@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ stan@@ tly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a gla@@ ss of water , a p@@ ac@@ k of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spe@@ cted figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the si@@ tu@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fied me the most was his use of a lan@@ d@@ line tele@@ phone .
He would h@@ old on to the rece@@ i@@ ver and expe@@ ct me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it re@@ qui@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle uses a phone that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mi@@ ss@@ ing his com@@ man@@ ds ."
And so I made him a g@@ ol@@ den ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er through which he could di@@ sp@@ en@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ e@@ ces around the world as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of p@@ aper , rol@@ l it into the car@@ ri@@ age , ty@@ pe his e@@ ma@@ il or comm@@ and and pul@@ l the p@@ aper out ."
This de@@ vice would au@@ to@@ ma@@ tically sen@@ d the in@@ ten@@ ded person the let@@ ter as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of elec@@ tron@@ ic@@ s that under@@ stan@@ ds all of the me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal ac@@ tions and conver@@ ts it to di@@ git@@ al ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal inter@@ face .
"And of course , the obje@@ ct had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of rit@@ u@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle lik@@ es it ."
"The next work is a s@@ oun@@ d-@@ sen@@ si@@ tive in@@ st@@ al@@ lation that we af@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a no@@ tion of being sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ atu@@ res ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ atu@@ res which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they st@@ ret@@ ch their ne@@ cks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ els on three wal@@ ls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real cre@@ atu@@ res do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ un@@ e to s@@ ounds that s@@ care them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to bac@@ k@@ ground s@@ ounds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( No@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to for@@ e@@ ground s@@ ounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( W@@ hi@@ st@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as possible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavi@@ or , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e , mo@@ od s@@ w@@ ings , person@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very early prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video in@@ st@@ al@@ lation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with pla@@ ying with the no@@ tion of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ al@@ iz@@ es in ca@@ mera sur@@ ve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce , and we asked them to devel@@ op a piece of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a ca@@ mera that could look at people in the room , tra@@ ck them and re@@ place one person with the bac@@ k@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my col@@ lea@@ gue S@@ or@@ en , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ ce@@ s@@ sed video where the ca@@ mera has made him in@@ vi@@ sible ."
S@@ or@@ en en@@ ters the room . P@@ op ! He goes in@@ vi@@ sible .
And you can see that the ca@@ mera is tra@@ c@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a ca@@ mera looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ stan@@ tly in@@ vi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The S@@ un S@@ ha@@ do@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper , like a cu@@ t@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an oil sp@@ ill or a sun ."
"And from the front , this obje@@ ct appe@@ ared to be very str@@ ong and ro@@ bu@@ st , and from the side , it almost see@@ med very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ nor@@ e it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to cli@@ m@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y fas@@ hi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted , and it would col@@ l@@ ap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of fal@@ len into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a plan@@ t ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken fas@@ hi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ predi@@ c@@ table and extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low mo@@ vement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an in@@ stance — so when people en@@ ter the room , it ac@@ ti@@ va@@ tes this obje@@ ct ."
"And it very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ ful@@ ly goes up , and then it ga@@ ins mo@@ men@@ tum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an in@@ st@@ in@@ ct to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ je@@ ct ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ a@@ ges to pul@@ l itself up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ ni@@ cal challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s right and the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would da@@ ma@@ ge itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it w@@ ouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ al@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quic@@ k video where we are doing a test s@@ cen@@ ar@@ i@@ o — it &apos;s much fas@@ ter .
That &apos;s my col@@ lea@@ gue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go cat@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ a@@ ges to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tin@@ y different siz@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we wr@@ app@@ ed this around a blo@@ b@@ -@@ like form , which is in the shap@@ e of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was han@@ ging from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tr@@ ast something very c@@ old and di@@ st@@ ant and ab@@ stra@@ ct like the universe into the famili@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ ti@@ mate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ ce@@ ive it to be a h@@ ole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ il@@ ler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tried to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ te you by gro@@ wing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; e@@ ight &#93; times its v@@ olu@@ me ."
And so this obje@@ ct is con@@ stan@@ tly exp@@ an@@ ding and con@@ tra@@ cting to create a dy@@ na@@ mic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a se@@ cre@@ t within its se@@ a@@ ms or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pre@@ ss the emo@@ tions and behavi@@ or@@ al patter@@ ns in these cre@@ atu@@ res that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature pop@@ s into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to ex@@ ist and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ K , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love ."
"And speci@@ f@@ ically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love ."
"M@@ ost of us will probably f@@ all in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the En@@ gli@@ sh language , this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or , fal@@ ling , is really the ma@@ in way that we talk about that experience ."
"I don &apos;t know about you , but when I con@@ cep@@ tu@@ al@@ ize this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or , what I picture is stra@@ ight out of a car@@ to@@ on — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s wal@@ king down the si@@ de@@ walk , without real@@ iz@@ ing it , he c@@ ros@@ ses over an open man@@ h@@ ole , and he just p@@ lu@@ mme@@ ts into the se@@ wer be@@ low ."
And I picture it this way because fal@@ ling is not ju@@ mp@@ ing .
"F@@ al@@ ling is ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal , it &apos;s un@@ con@@ trol@@ la@@ ble ."
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our con@@ s@@ ent .
And this — this is the ma@@ in way we talk about star@@ ting a new relation@@ ship .
"I am a wr@@ it@@ er and I &apos;m also an En@@ gli@@ sh te@@ ac@@ her , which means I think about words for a living ."
"You could say that I get pa@@ id to ar@@ gue that the language we use mat@@ ters , and I would like to ar@@ gue that many of the met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem ."
"So , in love , we f@@ all ."
We &apos;re stru@@ ck .
We are cru@@ shed .
We s@@ wo@@ on .
We bur@@ n with pas@@ sion .
"L@@ o@@ ve makes us cra@@ z@@ y , and it makes us si@@ ck ."
"O@@ ur he@@ ar@@ ts ac@@ he , and then they bre@@ ak ."
So our met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors equ@@ ate the experience of lo@@ ving someone to extre@@ me viol@@ ence or il@@ l@@ ness .
( Laughter ) They do .
And they posi@@ tion us as the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of un@@ for@@ e@@ seen and tot@@ ally un@@ av@@ o@@ i@@ da@@ ble cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces .
"My fav@@ or@@ ite one of these is &quot; &quot; sm@@ it@@ ten , &quot; &quot; which is the past parti@@ ci@@ ple of the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defin@@ ed as both &quot; &quot; g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ous a@@ ff@@ li@@ ction , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I t@@ end to as@@ soci@@ ate the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite &quot; &quot; with a very particular con@@ text , which is the O@@ ld T@@ est@@ a@@ ment ."
"In the B@@ o@@ ok of E@@ x@@ o@@ du@@ s al@@ one , there are 1@@ 6 re@@ fer@@ ences to sm@@ iting , which is the word that the Bi@@ ble uses for the ven@@ ge@@ ance of an an@@ gr@@ y God ."
( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to expla@@ in a pla@@ gue of lo@@ cu@@ sts . ( Laughter )
R@@ ight ?
"So , how did this happen ?"
How have we come to as@@ soci@@ ate love with great pa@@ in and su@@ ff@@ ering ?
And why do we talk about this os@@ ten@@ si@@ bly good experience as if we are v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?
"These are difficult questions , but I have some the@@ or@@ ies ."
"And to think this through , I want to focu@@ s on one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or in particular , which is the idea of love as mad@@ ness ."
"When I first started re@@ sear@@ ching ro@@ man@@ tic love , I found these mad@@ ness met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors every@@ where ."
The history of We@@ ster@@ n culture is full of language that equ@@ a@@ tes love to mental il@@ l@@ ness .
These are just a few exa@@ mp@@ les .
"W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ ha@@ ke@@ spe@@ are : &quot; Lo@@ ve is mer@@ ely a mad@@ ness , &quot; from &quot; &quot; A@@ s You L@@ ik@@ e It . &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ed@@ ri@@ ch N@@ i@@ et@@ z@@ sch@@ e : &quot; There is always some mad@@ ness in love . &quot;"
"&quot; G@@ ot me looking , got me looking so cra@@ z@@ y in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her , B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é K@@ no@@ w@@ les . ( Laughter )"
"I f@@ ell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty tur@@ bul@@ ent relation@@ ship right from the start ."
"And it was long di@@ stance for the first couple of years , so for me that me@@ ant very high high@@ s and very low lo@@ ws ."
I can remember one moment in particular .
"I was si@@ tting on a bed in a h@@ os@@ te@@ l in S@@ outh America , and I was wat@@ ching the person I love walk out the do@@ or ."
"And it was late , it was ne@@ ar@@ ly mid@@ night , we &apos;d g@@ ot@@ ten into an ar@@ gu@@ ment over din@@ ner , and when we got back to our room , he thre@@ w his things in the ba@@ g and stor@@ med out ."
"Wh@@ ile I can no longer remember what that ar@@ gu@@ ment was about , I very c@@ lear@@ ly remember how I felt wat@@ ching him leave ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , it was my first time in the develop@@ ing world , and I was tot@@ ally al@@ one ."
"I had another week until my f@@ light home , and I knew the name of the to@@ wn that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to f@@ ly out , but I had no idea how to get around ."
"I had no gu@@ ide@@ book and very little money , and I sp@@ ok@@ e no S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"S@@ ome@@ one more ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous than me might have seen this as a moment of opport@@ unity , but I just f@@ ro@@ ze ."
I just s@@ at there .
And then I bur@@ st into te@@ ars .
"But de@@ sp@@ ite my pan@@ ic , some small vo@@ ice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow . That was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel mi@@ ser@@ able in love .
"And it s@@ ounds so st@@ range to me now , but at 2@@ 2 , I lon@@ ged to have dra@@ ma@@ tic experi@@ ences , and in that moment , I was ir@@ ra@@ tional and fu@@ ri@@ ous and dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted , and we@@ ir@@ dly enough , I thought that this some@@ how le@@ gi@@ ti@@ miz@@ ed the fe@@ el@@ ings I had for the guy who had just left me ."
"I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit cra@@ z@@ y , because I thought that that was how lo@@ ved worked ."
"This really should not be surpri@@ sing , consi@@ der@@ ing that ac@@ cor@@ ding to W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia , there are e@@ ight fil@@ ms , 1@@ 4 son@@ gs , two al@@ bu@@ ms and one no@@ vel with the ti@@ tle &quot; &quot; C@@ raz@@ y Lo@@ ve . &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ out half an h@@ our later , he came back to our room ."
We made up .
We sp@@ ent another mos@@ tly happy week tra@@ v@@ eling together .
"And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so ter@@ ri@@ ble and so great ."
"This must be a real ro@@ man@@ ce . &quot; &quot; I expe@@ cted my first love to feel like mad@@ ness , and of course , it met that expe@@ c@@ tation very well ."
But lo@@ ving someone like that — as if my entire wel@@ l-@@ being de@@ pen@@ ded on him lo@@ ving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
But I su@@ spe@@ ct this experience of love is not that unu@@ su@@ al .
M@@ ost of us do feel a bit ma@@ d in the early sta@@ ges of ro@@ man@@ tic love .
"In fact , there is research to con@@ fir@@ m that this is some@@ what normal , because , ne@@ uro@@ chemi@@ cally spe@@ ak@@ ing , ro@@ man@@ tic love and mental il@@ l@@ ness are not that eas@@ ily di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ ish@@ ed ."
This is true .
"( Laughter ) Y@@ es , and low lev@@ els of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in are also as@@ soci@@ ated with se@@ as@@ on@@ al af@@ fe@@ ctive di@@ sor@@ der and de@@ pres@@ sion ."
So there is some ev@@ iden@@ ce that love is as@@ soci@@ ated with changes to our mo@@ o@@ ds and our behavi@@ ors .
And there are other stu@@ dies to con@@ fir@@ m that most relation@@ shi@@ ps be@@ gin this way .
"@@ Re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers believe that the low lev@@ els of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in is cor@@ rela@@ ted with ob@@ ses@@ sive thinking about the obje@@ ct of love , which is like this fe@@ eling that someone has set up ca@@ mp in your brain ."
And most of us feel this way when we first f@@ all in love .
"But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — u@@ su@@ ally from a few months to a couple of years ."
"I decided that if my friends could not understand my g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ous a@@ ff@@ li@@ ction , then I did not need their fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship ."
So I st@@ opp@@ ed han@@ ging out with most of them .
And it was probably the most un@@ happy year of my life .
"But I think I felt like it was my job to be mi@@ ser@@ able , because if I could be mi@@ ser@@ able , then I would pro@@ ve how much I lo@@ ved him ."
"And if I could pro@@ ve it , then we would have to end up together ev@@ en@@ tually ."
"This is the real mad@@ ness , because there is no cos@@ mic ru@@ le that says that great su@@ ff@@ ering equ@@ als great re@@ ward , but we talk about love as if this is true ."
O@@ ur experi@@ ences of love are both bi@@ ological and cul@@ tu@@ ral .
"O@@ ur bi@@ ology tel@@ ls us that love is good by ac@@ tiv@@ ating these re@@ ward cir@@ cu@@ its in our brain , and it tel@@ ls us that love is pain@@ ful when , after a fi@@ ght or a bre@@ ak@@ up , that ne@@ uro@@ chemi@@ cal re@@ ward is with@@ dra@@ wn ."
"And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — ne@@ uro@@ chemi@@ cally spe@@ ak@@ ing , going through a bre@@ ak@@ up is a lot like going through co@@ ca@@ ine with@@ dra@@ w@@ al , which I find reas@@ sur@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shap@@ e and re@@ in@@ for@@ ce these ideas about love .
"In this case , we &apos;re talking about met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors about pa@@ in and ad@@ di@@ ction and mad@@ ness ."
It &apos;s kind of an interesting fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op .
"L@@ o@@ ve is powerful and at times pain@@ ful , and we ex@@ pre@@ ss this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories pri@@ me us to expe@@ ct love to be powerful and pain@@ ful ."
What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that val@@ u@@ es li@@ fel@@ ong mon@@ o@@ ga@@ my .
"It see@@ ms like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like mad@@ ness , and we want it to last an entire li@@ fe@@ time ."
That s@@ ounds ter@@ ri@@ ble .
"( Laughter ) T@@ o re@@ con@@ c@@ ile this , we need to e@@ ither change our culture or change our expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions ."
"So , imagine if we were all less pas@@ sive in love ."
"If we were more as@@ ser@@ tive , more open@@ -@@ min@@ ded , more gener@@ ous and instead of fal@@ ling in love , we ste@@ pp@@ ed into love ."
"I know that this is as@@ king a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to sug@@ gest this ."
"In their book , &quot; &quot; M@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ ors We Li@@ ve B@@ y , &quot; &quot; lin@@ gu@@ ists Mar@@ k Joh@@ n@@ son and Ge@@ or@@ ge L@@ ak@@ off sug@@ gest a really interesting solu@@ tion to this di@@ lem@@ ma , which is to change our met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors ."
"They ar@@ gue that met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors really do shap@@ e the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a gu@@ ide for future ac@@ tions , like self-@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling pro@@ p@@ he@@ ci@@ es ."
Joh@@ n@@ son and L@@ ak@@ off sug@@ gest a new met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for love : love as a col@@ labor@@ a@@ tive work of art .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
"L@@ in@@ gu@@ ists talk about met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors as having en@@ ta@@ il@@ ments , which is essen@@ ti@@ ally a way of consi@@ der@@ ing all the imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions of , or ideas con@@ ta@@ ined within , a given met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"And Joh@@ n@@ son and L@@ ak@@ off talk about everything that col@@ labor@@ ating on a work of art en@@ ta@@ il@@ s : ef@@ for@@ t , com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se , pati@@ ence , sh@@ ared go@@ als ."
"These ideas ali@@ g@@ n ni@@ ce@@ ly with our cul@@ tu@@ ral inve@@ st@@ ment in lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m ro@@ man@@ tic comm@@ it@@ ment , but they also work well for other kinds of relation@@ shi@@ ps — sh@@ ort@@ -@@ ter@@ m , cas@@ ual , pol@@ ya@@ mor@@ ous , non@@ -@@ mon@@ o@@ ga@@ mous , as@@ ex@@ ual — because this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or br@@ ings much more comple@@ x ideas to the experience of lo@@ ving someone ."
"So if love is a col@@ labor@@ a@@ tive work of art , then love is an a@@ es@@ the@@ tic experience ."
"L@@ o@@ ve is un@@ predi@@ c@@ table , love is crea@@ tive , love re@@ qui@@ res communi@@ cation and dis@@ cip@@ line , it is f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ting and emo@@ tion@@ ally de@@ man@@ ding ."
And love inv@@ ol@@ ves both jo@@ y and pa@@ in .
"U@@ l@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , each experience of love is different ."
"When I was youn@@ ger , it never oc@@ cur@@ red to me that I was allo@@ wed to de@@ m@@ and more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just ac@@ cept w@@ hatever love off@@ er@@ ed ."
"When 1@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old Ju@@ li@@ et first me@@ ets — or , when 1@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old Ju@@ li@@ et cannot be with R@@ ome@@ o , wh@@ om she has met four days ago , she does not feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted or an@@ g@@ st@@ y ."
Wh@@ ere is she ?
She wan@@ ts to die .
R@@ ight ?
"And just as a re@@ fre@@ sh@@ er , at this point in the play , act three of five , R@@ ome@@ o is not de@@ ad ."
"He &apos;s ali@@ ve , he &apos;s heal@@ thy , he &apos;s just been ban@@ ish@@ ed from the city ."
"I understand that 1@@ 6@@ th@@ -@@ century V@@ er@@ ona is un@@ like con@@ temp@@ or@@ ary Nor@@ th America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 1@@ 4 , Ju@@ li@@ et &apos;s su@@ ff@@ ering made sense to me ."
"R@@ ef@@ ra@@ ming love as something I get to create with someone I ad@@ mi@@ re , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or con@@ s@@ ent , is emp@@ o@@ wer@@ ing ."
It &apos;s still hard .
"L@@ o@@ ve still fe@@ els tot@@ ally mad@@ den@@ ing and cru@@ sh@@ ing some days , and when I feel really f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted , I have to re@@ mind myself : my job in this relation@@ ship is to talk to my part@@ ner about what I want to make together ."
"This isn &apos;t easy , e@@ ither ."
"But it &apos;s just so much better than the al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive , which is that thing that fe@@ els like mad@@ ness ."
This ver@@ sion of love is not about win@@ ning or los@@ ing someone &apos;s af@@ fe@@ ction .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , it re@@ qui@@ res that you tru@@ st your part@@ ner and talk about things when tru@@ sting fe@@ els difficult , which s@@ ounds so simple , but is actually a kind of re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary , radi@@ cal act ."
"This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re ga@@ ining or los@@ ing in your relation@@ ship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to off@@ er ."
"This ver@@ sion of love allo@@ ws us to say things like , &quot; H@@ ey , we &apos;re not very good col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors . M@@ ay@@ be this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;"
"O@@ r , &quot; &quot; That relation@@ ship was sh@@ or@@ ter than I had plan@@ ned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the col@@ labor@@ a@@ tive work of art is that it will not pa@@ int or dra@@ w or s@@ cul@@ pt itself ."
This ver@@ sion of love allo@@ ws us to deci@@ de what it looks like .
Thank you .

I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ ink about everything it has b@@ rought us .
"Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we use , all the conne@@ c@@ tivity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the com@@ mer@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting history book@@ s hundre@@ ds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be reme@@ mb@@ er@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very ser@@ i@@ ous problems , problems with se@@ cur@@ ity and problems with pri@@ vac@@ y ."
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my car@@ e@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a f@@ l@@ opp@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch f@@ l@@ opp@@ y dis@@ k in@@ fe@@ cted by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vir@@ us we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot se@@ ctor of an in@@ fe@@ cted f@@ l@@ opp@@ y , and if we take a clos@@ er look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ u@@ es , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad are first na@@ mes , P@@ ak@@ ist@@ ani first na@@ mes ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C vir@@ us problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ ak@@ istan myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photo@@ s I took while I was in P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"This is from the city of L@@ ah@@ ore , which is around 3@@ 00 kil@@ ome@@ ters s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where B@@ in La@@ den was ca@@ u@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a ty@@ pi@@ cal stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad le@@ ad@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am blo@@ ck at Al@@ lama I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who open@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wr@@ ote the first P@@ C vir@@ us .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters in@@ fe@@ cted do@@ zen@@ s of times by completely un@@ rela@@ ted other vir@@ uses over these years .
So there is some sort of ju@@ sti@@ ce in the world after all .
"Now , the vir@@ uses that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exa@@ mp@@ les of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run a@@ ge@@ -@@ old progra@@ ms on a modern computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a li@@ st of old vir@@ uses .
So let me just run some vir@@ uses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vir@@ us first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a cen@@ ti@@ pe@@ de s@@ c@@ rol@@ ling across your computer when you get in@@ fe@@ cted by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted because it actually sho@@ ws up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the vir@@ us called C@@ ras@@ h , inven@@ ted in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ ir@@ en no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ k@@ er vir@@ us does ?"
"Y@@ es , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get in@@ fe@@ cted ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted by a vir@@ us , when the vir@@ uses were wr@@ it@@ ten by ho@@ b@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ a@@ gers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being wr@@ it@@ ten by ho@@ b@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ a@@ gers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vir@@ uses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the bac@@ k@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our la@@ b@@ s , where we tra@@ ck vir@@ us in@@ fe@@ ctions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blo@@ c@@ ked vir@@ uses in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just conne@@ ct back to our la@@ b systems through the We@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vir@@ uses , how many new exa@@ mp@@ les of mal@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the la@@ test vir@@ us we &apos;ve found , in a f@@ ile called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just s@@ c@@ rol@@ l around , it &apos;s just mas@@ sive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hundre@@ ds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed cri@@ min@@ al gan@@ gs wr@@ iting these vir@@ uses because they make money with their vir@@ uses ."
It &apos;s gan@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ an@@ g@@ sta@@ Bu@@ ck@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ site oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ co@@ w where these guys are bu@@ ying in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a vir@@ us wr@@ it@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of in@@ fe@@ cting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can se@@ ll those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s multi@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ lo@@ g@@ gers ."
"K@@ ey@@ lo@@ g@@ gers s@@ ilen@@ tly sit on your computer , hi@@ d@@ den from view , and they recor@@ d everything you ty@@ pe ."
So you &apos;re si@@ tting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google sear@@ ches .
E@@ very single Google search you ty@@ pe is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very single e@@ ma@@ il you wr@@ ite is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
Sa@@ me thing with every single pas@@ s@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are ses@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ ch@@ ases in any on@@ line stor@@ e .
"Because when you do pur@@ ch@@ ases in on@@ line stor@@ es , you will be ty@@ p@@ ing in your name , the deli@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d number and the cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d se@@ cur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a f@@ ile we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of we@@ eks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion da@@ te , that &apos;s the se@@ cur@@ ity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the car@@ d ."
"On@@ ce you ga@@ in ac@@ cess to other people &apos;s cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y w@@ hatever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground mark@@ et@@ place and business ec@@ osy@@ ste@@ m built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ z@@ ing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the pa@@ ges of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and search for wanted person@@ s .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ din , ori@@ gin@@ ally from S@@ we@@ den , and his part@@ ner in cri@@ me , also li@@ s@@ ted on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted pa@@ ges , M@@ r. S@@ ha@@ ile@@ sh@@ ku@@ ma@@ r J@@ a@@ in , a U.@@ S@@ . ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
"These guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted mil@@ lions ."
They are both right now on the run .
No@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"U@@ .@@ S@@ . off@@ ici@@ als , just a couple of we@@ eks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t bel@@ on@@ ging to M@@ r. J@@ a@@ in , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S@@ . dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ a@@ tes is sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually af@@ for@@ d to inve@@ st into their at@@ tac@@ ks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are hir@@ ing program@@ mers , hir@@ ing te@@ sting people , te@@ sting their co@@ de , having bac@@ k@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L da@@ tab@@ ases ."
And they can af@@ for@@ d to wat@@ ch how we work — like how se@@ cur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any se@@ cur@@ ity pre@@ ca@@ u@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ lar@@ i@@ fied N@@ et@@ works , which il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tes how one single mal@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be ori@@ gin@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ site is tried to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one ju@@ ris@@ di@@ ction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e tic@@ ket@@ s to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tra@@ ck them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exp@@ lo@@ it f@@ ile .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the He@@ x du@@ mp of an image f@@ ile , which con@@ ta@@ ins an exp@@ lo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image f@@ ile on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image f@@ ile — well there &apos;s the image he@@ ad@@ er , and there the ac@@ tual co@@ de of the at@@ tac@@ k star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been en@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted , so let &apos;s de@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ pt it ."
It has been en@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R fun@@ ction 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start de@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the co@@ de is now de@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the ori@@ gin@@ al ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a We@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ se@@ ek@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that program .
And that &apos;s a bac@@ k@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more interest@@ ing@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue de@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ tion as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goo@@ g@@ led for it .
I got zer@@ o h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I sp@@ ok@@ e with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our la@@ b@@ s , and one of them men@@ tion@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone num@@ bers and car li@@ cen@@ se pla@@ tes and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for con@@ tac@@ ts in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ site ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who run@@ s his own we@@ b@@ site , and he run@@ s a blo@@ g under the popu@@ lar Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very ni@@ ce car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ Ben@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ li@@ ter en@@ gine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a ni@@ ce car for a 20@@ -@@ something ye@@ ar-@@ old k@@ id in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blo@@ g@@ ged about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually c@@ ras@@ h@@ ed his car into another car ."
And he put blo@@ g@@ ged ima@@ ges about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ada Sa@@ mar@@ a he c@@ ras@@ h@@ ed into .
And you can actually see that the li@@ cen@@ se pla@@ te of the Sa@@ mar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the s@@ cen@@ e picture , you can see that the pla@@ te of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ yer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are ca@@ u@@ ght ?"
Well in most cas@@ es it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me cas@@ es , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the at@@ tac@@ ks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough ev@@ iden@@ ce , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be eas@@ i@@ er ; un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also chan@@ ging at a very rap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it in@@ fe@@ cted these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ e@@ men@@ s S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , program@@ ma@@ ble lo@@ gi@@ c &#91; con@@ trol@@ ler &#93; ."
And this is what run@@ s our inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are program@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the ele@@ v@@ at@@ ors in this building most lik@@ ely are con@@ trol@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net in@@ fe@@ cts one of these , that &apos;s a mas@@ sive re@@ v@@ olution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture ."
"You go to any fac@@ tor@@ y , any power plan@@ t , any chemi@@ cal plan@@ t , any food pro@@ cess@@ ing plan@@ t , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ very@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on bas@@ ic things like electri@@ city , obvi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which crea@@ tes completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fa@@ il .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very bas@@ ic stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about bac@@ ku@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ ink about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
On@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my life def@@ en@@ ding the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are run@@ ning a risk of los@@ ing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al gan@@ gs — these organiz@@ ed gan@@ gs that are making mil@@ lions out of their at@@ tac@@ ks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning anti@@ -@@ vir@@ uses or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ wal@@ ls .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these at@@ tac@@ ks , and even more imp@@ or@@ tan@@ tly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the s@@ kil@@ ls , but without the opport@@ uni@@ ties and give them the opport@@ uni@@ ties to use their s@@ kil@@ ls for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is chan@@ ging with really re@@ mark@@ able spe@@ ed .
"If you look at the ch@@ art at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proje@@ ctions sug@@ gest that the Ch@@ in@@ ese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
"And if you look at the ch@@ art for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s proje@@ cted that the Ch@@ in@@ ese economy will be tw@@ ice the size of the American economy , and the In@@ di@@ an economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
And we should be@@ ar in mind here that these proje@@ ctions were dra@@ wn up before the We@@ ster@@ n finan@@ cial cri@@ sis .
"A couple of we@@ eks ago , I was looking at the la@@ test proje@@ ction by B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ b@@ as for when China will have a lar@@ ger economy than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proje@@ cted 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The pos@@ t-@@ cri@@ sis proje@@ ction is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a deca@@ de away .
China is going to change the world in two fun@@ da@@ mental re@@ spe@@ cts .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a huge develop@@ ing country with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been gro@@ wing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a deca@@ de , it will have the lar@@ gest economy in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the modern er@@ a has the lar@@ gest economy in the world been that of a develop@@ ing country , rather than a develop@@ ed country ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , for the first time in the modern er@@ a , the do@@ min@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tional ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a w@@ ide@@ sp@@ read as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion in the W@@ est that as countries moder@@ n@@ ize , they also we@@ ster@@ n@@ ize ."
This is an il@@ lu@@ sion .
"It &apos;s an as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that moder@@ n@@ ity is a produ@@ ct simply of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , mark@@ ets and technology ."
It is not . It is also shap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"@@ China is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ ma@@ in in very fun@@ da@@ mental re@@ spe@@ cts very different .
"Now the big question here is obvi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the con@@ ven@@ tional appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in We@@ ster@@ n terms , using We@@ ster@@ n ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to off@@ er you three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state for the last hun@@ d@@ red years , but everyone who kno@@ ws anything about China kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the v@@ ic@@ tor@@ y of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ n@@ as@@ ty in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ state peri@@ od — the bir@@ th of modern China .
And you can see it against the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies of modern China .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ n@@ as@@ ty , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ es most of what we now know as E@@ as@@ ter@@ n China , which is where the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of Ch@@ in@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is extra@@ ordin@@ ary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Ch@@ in@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Ch@@ in@@ ese , comes not from the last hun@@ d@@ red years , not from the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state peri@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the peri@@ od , if you like , of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ sto@@ ms like an@@ ce@@ stra@@ l wor@@ ship , of a very di@@ st@@ inc@@ tive no@@ tion of the state , lik@@ e@@ wi@@ se , a very di@@ st@@ inc@@ tive no@@ tion of the family , social relation@@ shi@@ ps like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an val@@ u@@ es and so on ."
These are all things that come from the peri@@ od of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the We@@ ster@@ n sta@@ tes and most countries in the world , is shap@@ ed by its sense of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , its ex@@ ist@@ ence as a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , rather than as a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ cally and ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cally , with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often ar@@ en &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that China is extre@@ me@@ ly di@@ verse and very p@@ l@@ ur@@ al@@ isti@@ c , and in many ways very de@@ cen@@ tr@@ al@@ ized ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , rather than a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of pro@@ found imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions ."
I &apos;ll give you two quic@@ k ones .
"The first is that the most important political value for the Ch@@ in@@ ese is unity , is the ma@@ in@@ ten@@ ance of Ch@@ in@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Euro@@ pe : bre@@ ak@@ down — the fra@@ g@@ men@@ tation of the H@@ ol@@ y Ro@@ man E@@ mp@@ ire ."
"It di@@ vi@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ ined di@@ vi@@ ded ever since ."
"@@ China , over the same time peri@@ od , went in exactly the op@@ pos@@ ite dire@@ ction , very pain@@ ful@@ ly hol@@ ding this huge ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pr@@ os@@ a@@ ic , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
D@@ o you remember the han@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by B@@ rit@@ a@@ in to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Ch@@ in@@ ese con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ posi@@ tion was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll la@@ y a wa@@ ger that bar@@ ely any@@ one in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ do@@ w d@@ res@@ sing .
"When China gets its hands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the political and le@@ g@@ al system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , nat@@ ur@@ ally enough , in na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ ink of Ger@@ man uni@@ fi@@ cation , 199@@ 0 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state men@@ tal@@ ity .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , on the bas@@ is of one ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an — was a natural respon@@ se : one ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , many systems ."
Let me off@@ er you another building blo@@ ck to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a com@@ for@@ table one .
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very , very different con@@ cep@@ tion of ra@@ ce to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Ch@@ in@@ ese , over 9@@ 0 percent of them think they bel@@ ong to the same ra@@ ce , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most pop@@ ul@@ ous countries ."
"I@@ n@@ dia , the United States , In@@ don@@ e@@ si@@ a , B@@ raz@@ il — all of them are multi@@ ra@@ cial ."
The Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multi@@ ra@@ cial really at the mar@@ gin@@ s .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , essen@@ ti@@ ally is , again , back to the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation , ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion , as@@ si@@ mi@@ lation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this no@@ tion of the H@@ an emer@@ ged — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a gro@@ wing and very powerful sense of cul@@ tu@@ ral iden@@ ti@@ ty ."
"Now the great ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge of this hi@@ stor@@ i@@ cal experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have hel@@ d together ."
The H@@ an iden@@ ti@@ ty has been the ce@@ ment which has hel@@ d this country together .
The great di@@ sa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ge of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ ak con@@ cep@@ tion of cul@@ tu@@ ral difference .
"They really believe in their own su@@ peri@@ or@@ ity , and they are dis@@ re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur@@ s and to the T@@ i@@ be@@ tan@@ s ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building blo@@ ck , the Ch@@ in@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly see@@ m to think — in these days at least — that the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy of the state is a fun@@ ction of democra@@ cy .
The problem with this pro@@ posi@@ tion is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese state en@@ j@@ oy@@ s more le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy and more au@@ th@@ or@@ ity a@@ mon@@ g@@ st the Ch@@ in@@ ese than is true with any We@@ ster@@ n state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s obvi@@ ously got nothing to do with democra@@ cy , because in our terms the Ch@@ in@@ ese cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have a democra@@ cy ."
"And the reason for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very speci@@ al — it en@@ j@@ oy@@ s a very speci@@ al sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance as the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Ch@@ in@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual r@@ ole .
"And the second reason is because , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as in Euro@@ pe and Nor@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is contin@@ u@@ ously challen@@ ged — I mean in the Euro@@ pe@@ an tradi@@ tion , hi@@ stor@@ ically against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other se@@ c@@ tors of the ar@@ ist@@ o@@ cra@@ cy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Ch@@ in@@ ese state has not been challen@@ ged ."
It &apos;s had no ser@@ i@@ ous ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ stru@@ cted in China is very different from our experience in We@@ ster@@ n history .
"The res@@ ult , by the way , is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as we t@@ end to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a st@@ ran@@ ger , cer@@ tain@@ ly an or@@ gan wh@@ ose po@@ w@@ ers need to be li@@ mi@@ ted or defin@@ ed and con@@ stra@@ ined , the Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese view the state as an in@@ ti@@ mate — not just as an in@@ ti@@ mate actually , as a me@@ mber of the family — not just in fact as a me@@ mber of the family , but as the head of the family , the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of the family ."
"This is the Ch@@ in@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to ours ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would sug@@ gest to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Ch@@ in@@ ese con@@ text , is a new kind of para@@ di@@ g@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China beli@@ ev@@ es in the market and the state .
"I mean , A@@ dam S@@ m@@ ith , already wr@@ iting in the late 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ in@@ ese market is lar@@ ger and more develop@@ ed and more s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cated than anything in Euro@@ pe . &quot; &quot; And , ap@@ art from the Ma@@ o peri@@ od , that has re@@ ma@@ ined more or less the case ever since ."
But this is com@@ bin@@ ed with an extre@@ me@@ ly str@@ ong and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s le@@ ad@@ ing fir@@ ms — many of them are still publi@@ c@@ ly ow@@ ned ."
"P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , ho@@ w@@ ever large they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , de@@ p@@ end in many ways on state pat@@ ron@@ age ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its au@@ th@@ or@@ ity flo@@ ws into lots of other are@@ as — as we are famili@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"M@@ or@@ e@@ over , this is a very old state tradi@@ tion , a very old tradi@@ tion of sta@@ tec@@ raf@@ t ."
"I mean , if you want an il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion of this , the Gre@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ stru@@ cted in the first in@@ stance in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally comple@@ ted in the se@@ ven@@ th century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 1@@ 4 mi@@ les , lin@@ king Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing with H@@ an@@ g@@ z@@ h@@ ou and S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of extra@@ ordin@@ ary state inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ c@@ tu@@ ral proje@@ cts in China , which I supp@@ ose hel@@ ps us to expla@@ in what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ or@@ ges D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state comp@@ et@@ ence within China ."
"So there we have three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , the no@@ tion of ra@@ ce and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still in@@ si@@ st , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply dra@@ wing on We@@ ster@@ n experience , looking at it through We@@ ster@@ n eyes , using We@@ ster@@ n con@@ cep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ing@@ ly see@@ m to get China wrong — our predi@@ ctions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct — this is the reason .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de to@@ wards China is that of a kind of little We@@ ster@@ ner men@@ tal@@ ity ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and ther@@ e@@ fore we have the uni@@ ver@@ sal meas@@ ure ."
"And secon@@ dly , it &apos;s ig@@ nor@@ ant ."
We re@@ f@@ use to really ad@@ dre@@ ss the issu@@ e of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pas@@ sa@@ ge in a book by P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en , the American hi@@ stor@@ ian ."
And P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en ar@@ gu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most cos@@ m@@ op@@ oli@@ tan of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most par@@ o@@ chi@@ al , because for 200 years , the W@@ est has been so do@@ min@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tions ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if ne@@ cess@@ ary by for@@ ce , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as those cul@@ tures — vir@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ ak@@ er posi@@ tion , vis@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been ther@@ e@@ by for@@ ced to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s presen@@ ce in those soci@@ e@@ ties ."
"And ther@@ e@@ fore , they are , as a res@@ ult , more cos@@ m@@ op@@ oli@@ tan in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : Jap@@ an , K@@ or@@ e@@ a , China , et@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
Now the lar@@ gest economic regi@@ on in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the present ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ac@@ k to that ch@@ art at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ch@@ art ."
"What is happening is that , very rap@@ id@@ ly in hi@@ stor@@ i@@ cal terms , the world is being dri@@ ven and shap@@ ed , not by the old develop@@ ed countries , but by the develop@@ ing world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 us@@ ur@@ p@@ ing very rap@@ id@@ ly the posi@@ tion of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ sequ@@ ences of this .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the W@@ est is rap@@ id@@ ly los@@ ing its inf@@ lu@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dra@@ ma@@ tic il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion of this actually a year ago — C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen , cli@@ mate change con@@ fer@@ ence ."
Euro@@ pe was not at the fin@@ al ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating table .
Wh@@ en did that last happen ?
I would wa@@ ger it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second imp@@ li@@ cation is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly un@@ famili@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be shap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experi@@ ences and hi@@ stories that we are not really famili@@ ar with , or conver@@ san@@ t with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Euro@@ pe ; America is sli@@ gh@@ tly different — but Euro@@ pe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ig@@ nor@@ ant , are un@@ aw@@ are about the way the world is chan@@ ging ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an En@@ gli@@ sh friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is s@@ le@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exa@@ g@@ ger@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Euro@@ pe is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly out of tou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of los@@ s of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Euro@@ pe once , of course , once com@@ man@@ ded the future in its con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce ."
"T@@ ake the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to tas@@ te the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation the lik@@ es of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation for the high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed tra@@ ins .
China already has a big@@ ger net@@ work than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the rest of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out sh@@ ort@@ ly in a su@@ bur@@ b of Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the u@@ pp@@ er de@@ ck car@@ ri@@ es about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It tra@@ v@@ els on ra@@ il@@ s down a su@@ bur@@ b@@ an ro@@ ad , and the c@@ ars tra@@ vel under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ eds of up to about 100 mi@@ les an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very speci@@ fic problem , which is different from Euro@@ pe and different from the United States : China has huge num@@ bers of people and no space ."
"So this is a solu@@ tion to a si@@ tu@@ ation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de be to@@ wards this world that we see very rap@@ id@@ ly develop@@ ing before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to ar@@ gue , ab@@ o@@ ve all , a big@@ -@@ picture posi@@ tive for this world ."
"For 200 years , the world was essen@@ ti@@ ally gover@@ ned by a fra@@ g@@ ment of the human population ."
That &apos;s what Euro@@ pe and Nor@@ th America re@@ presen@@ ted .
"The ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ don@@ e@@ si@@ a and B@@ raz@@ il and so on , re@@ present the most important single act of democra@@ ti@@ za@@ tion in the last 200 years ."
"C@@ i@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tions and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ nor@@ ed , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not list@@ en@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of re@@ presen@@ tation in this world ."
"As human@@ ists , we must wel@@ come , su@@ re@@ ly , this trans@@ formation , and we will have to learn about these ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tions ."
"This big ship here was the one sa@@ i@@ led in by Z@@ hen@@ g He in the early 1@@ 5@@ th century on his great vo@@ ya@@ ges around the S@@ outh China Se@@ a , the E@@ ast China Se@@ a and across the In@@ di@@ an O@@ ce@@ an to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little bo@@ at in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ op@@ her C@@ olu@@ m@@ bu@@ s c@@ ros@@ sed the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at this s@@ ilk s@@ c@@ rol@@ l made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re pla@@ ying g@@ ol@@ f .
"@@ Ch@@ ri@@ st , the Ch@@ in@@ ese even inven@@ ted g@@ ol@@ f ."
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a re@@ v@@ olution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ ak into son@@ g , or you pic@@ k a fav@@ or@@ ite col@@ or , I want to def@@ ine what I mean by re@@ v@@ olution ."
"B@@ y re@@ v@@ olution , I mean a dr@@ as@@ tic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , S@@ te@@ ve , why do we need a re@@ v@@ olution ?"
We need a re@@ v@@ olution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sa@@ d because I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us not living up to our pot@@ ential ."
I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors ."
We &apos;re last place in Euro@@ pe in inno@@ v@@ ation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ to@@ m , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value inno@@ v@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of wel@@ l-@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Euro@@ pe , at the very bot@@ to@@ m ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three we@@ eks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ con@@ omi@@ st ."
"We &apos;re the sa@@ d@@ de@@ st place on Earth , rela@@ tive to G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a — the sa@@ d@@ de@@ st place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Wh@@ ere do we ran@@ k three we@@ eks ago in another re@@ p@@ ort by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in read@@ ing , ma@@ th and science . L@@ ast ."
Bu@@ sin@@ ess : The lo@@ we@@ st per@@ cep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U@@ .
that en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ s provi@@ de ben@@ ef@@ its to society .
"Wh@@ y as a res@@ ult , what happens ?"
The lo@@ we@@ st per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ s star@@ ting busin@@ es@@ ses .
And this is de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that everybody kno@@ ws that small business is the en@@ gine of economi@@ es .
We hi@@ re the most people ; we create the most ta@@ x@@ es .
"So if our en@@ gine &apos;s bro@@ ken , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Euro@@ pe G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no surpri@@ se , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ gar@@ i@@ ans are not op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st busin@@ es@@ ses ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story tal@@ e ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy I have got against B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really cle@@ ar that our system is bro@@ ken ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is bro@@ ken ."
"We need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be posi@@ tive now . We &apos;re going to get posi@@ tive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ as@@ tic to some of you — because we are han@@ di@@ c@@ app@@ ing ourselves .
We &apos;re hol@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ a@@ bi@@ es play , kids play , a@@ du@@ l@@ ts play ."
We don &apos;t value play .
"In fact , we dev@@ al@@ ue play ."
And we dev@@ al@@ ue it in three are@@ as .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three are@@ as .
So@@ cial : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f comm@@ un@@ ism — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individu@@ al and squ@@ as@@ h@@ ing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly , crea@@ tivity , individu@@ al self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion and inno@@ v@@ ation ."
"And instead , what do we value ?"
"Because it &apos;s sho@@ wn the way we app@@ ly , gener@@ ate and use knowle@@ dge is af@@ fe@@ cted by our social and in@@ stitu@@ tional con@@ text , which told us what in comm@@ un@@ ism ?"
T@@ o be ser@@ i@@ ous .
"T@@ o be really , really ser@@ i@@ ous ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e ser@@ i@@ ous .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been s@@ col@@ ded in the par@@ k for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ e@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d they play in the dir@@ t , the ka@@ l , or even wor@@ se , lo@@ k@@ vi , water — that will k@@ ill them ."
I have been told by bab@@ as and d@@ ya@@ do@@ s that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is ser@@ i@@ ous and we need to tra@@ in them for the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of life .
We have a ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me run@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e run@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a ser@@ i@@ ous gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a bab@@ y . I@@ s@@ ka@@ m bab@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ te@@ p two : we get the bab@@ y . W@@ oo@@ ho@@ o !@@ "
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to f@@ ur@@ ther my car@@ e@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ f@@ fe@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ k@@ o to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been in@@ fe@@ cted by the ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"S@@ he pas@@ ses that vir@@ us on to bab@@ y , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ wo@@ od tre@@ es — for that ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ u@@ es r@@ ote learning , me@@ mor@@ iz@@ ation and stan@@ dar@@ di@@ za@@ tion , and dev@@ al@@ u@@ es self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , self-@@ exp@@ lor@@ ation , ques@@ tion@@ ing , crea@@ tivity and play ."
It &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my k@@ id .
We went to this pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study ma@@ th 10 times a week and science e@@ ight times a week and read@@ ing five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and re@@ cess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the sch@@ edu@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cri@@ me . What a cri@@ me ."
"And it &apos;s a cri@@ me that our education system is so ser@@ i@@ ous because education is ser@@ i@@ ous that we &apos;re cre@@ ating min@@ d@@ less , robo@@ tic work@@ ers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ dr@@ il@@ led hol@@ es ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ ev@@ olution ."
"We need ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ bility , the ability to learn how to be crea@@ tive and inno@@ va@@ tive ."
We don &apos;t need me@@ chan@@ ized work@@ ers .
"But no , now our me@@ me goes into work where we don &apos;t value play ."
"We create robo@@ tic work@@ ers that we tre@@ at like as@@ se@@ ts , to le@@ ver and just th@@ row away ."
What are qu@@ ali@@ ties of a B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ian work ?
Au@@ to@@ cra@@ tic — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the b@@ os@@ s and I know better than you .
"U@@ n@@ tru@@ sting — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously a cri@@ min@@ al , so I &apos;m going to in@@ st@@ all ca@@ mer@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ trol@@ ling — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously an i@@ di@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ il@@ lion little pro@@ ce@@ s@@ ses for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t step out of the bo@@ x ."
"So they &apos;re re@@ stri@@ ctive — don &apos;t use your mo@@ bile phone , don &apos;t use your l@@ ap@@ top , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ ."
That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ profes@@ sion@@ al and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling because you &apos;re con@@ trol@@ led , you &apos;re re@@ stri@@ cted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any f@@ un ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , S@@ te@@ ve . What a du@@ m@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"@@ Ju@@ st play , that &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id thing . &quot; &quot; We have the ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ e@@ ch — that play is the cat@@ al@@ y@@ st , it is the re@@ v@@ olution , that we can use to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
P@@ la@@ y : our bra@@ ins are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ v@@ olution has se@@ le@@ cted , over mil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of years , for play in animals and in humans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ v@@ olution does a really , really good job of de@@ se@@ le@@ cting tra@@ its that ar@@ en &apos;t ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous to us and se@@ le@@ cting tra@@ its for com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge ."
"N@@ ature isn &apos;t stu@@ p@@ id , and it se@@ le@@ cted for play ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , for example : an@@ ts . An@@ ts play ."
M@@ ay@@ be you didn &apos;t know that .
"But when they &apos;re pla@@ ying , they &apos;re learning the social order and dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs of things ."
"R@@ at@@ s play , but what you might not have known is that ra@@ ts that play more have big@@ ger bra@@ ins and they learn tas@@ ks better , s@@ kil@@ ls ."
K@@ it@@ ten@@ s play . We all know kit@@ ten@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that kit@@ ten@@ s de@@ pri@@ ved of play are un@@ able to inter@@ act soci@@ ally .
"They can still hun@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social ."
Be@@ ars play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more survi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a fin@@ al really interesting study — it &apos;s been sho@@ wn , a cor@@ rela@@ tion between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the big@@ ger the bra@@ ins there are ."
"D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big bra@@ ins , play a lot ."
But who do you think with the big@@ gest bra@@ ins are the big@@ gest pla@@ yer@@ s ?
Y@@ ours tru@@ ly : humans .
"K@@ i@@ ds play , we play — of every na@@ tion@@ ality , of every ra@@ ce , of every col@@ or , of every reli@@ gi@@ on ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ ver@@ sal thing — we play .
"And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s a@@ du@@ l@@ ts too ."
Re@@ ally co@@ ol ter@@ m : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in a@@ du@@ l@@ ts .
And who are the big@@ gest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
H@@ u@@ man@@ s . We play sp@@ or@@ ts .
"We do it for f@@ un , or as O@@ ly@@ mp@@ i@@ ans , or as profes@@ sion@@ als ."
We play mu@@ si@@ cal in@@ stru@@ ments .
"We dan@@ ce , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re desig@@ ned by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re desig@@ ned to do that contin@@ u@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop pla@@ ying .
It is a huge ben@@ ef@@ it .
"@@ Ju@@ st like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to humans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sho@@ wn to sti@@ mu@@ late ne@@ ural growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a , in the area where it con@@ tr@@ ols emo@@ tions ."
It &apos;s been sho@@ wn to pro@@ m@@ ote pre@@ -@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ ment where a lot of co@@ g@@ ni@@ tion is happening .
"As a res@@ ult , what happens ?"
We devel@@ op more emo@@ tional ma@@ tur@@ ity if we play more .
We devel@@ op better deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s c@@ old , hard science ."
These are the ben@@ ef@@ its to play .
"It is a gene@@ tic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spe@@ ak@@ ing or seeing ."
"And if we han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves with play , we han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We h@@ old ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ ma@@ gine a world without the@@ at@@ er , without the ar@@ ts , without son@@ g , without dan@@ cing , without so@@ c@@ cer , without fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , without la@@ u@@ ghter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty b@@ le@@ ak .
It &apos;s pretty g@@ lu@@ m .
Now imagine your work@@ place .
I@@ s it f@@ un ? I@@ s it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the work@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re for@@ ward thinking .
I@@ s it f@@ un ? I@@ s it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it cra@@ p ? I@@ s it au@@ to@@ cra@@ tic , con@@ trol@@ ling , re@@ stri@@ ctive and un@@ tru@@ sting and un@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling ?"
We have this con@@ cept that the op@@ pos@@ ite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen pla@@ ying at work .
"&quot; Oh , my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es see me la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ os@@ s might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is bac@@ k@@ wards .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of play is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of play
is de@@ pres@@ sion . It &apos;s de@@ pres@@ sion .
"In fact , play im@@ pro@@ ves our work ."
"@@ Ju@@ st like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for humans and animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for play at work ."
"For example , it sti@@ mu@@ la@@ tes crea@@ tivity ."
It incre@@ ases our open@@ ness to change .
It im@@ pro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It pro@@ vide@@ s a sense of pur@@ p@@ ose and ma@@ ster@@ y — two key mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tional things that incre@@ ase produ@@ c@@ tivity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not ser@@ i@@ ous , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ v@@ ol@@ ous ."
"You know , the profes@@ sion@@ al a@@ th@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s ser@@ i@@ ous about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"He &apos;s having f@@ un , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A do@@ ctor might be ser@@ i@@ ous , but la@@ u@@ ghter &apos;s still a great medi@@ cine ."
O@@ ur thinking is bac@@ k@@ wards .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fe@@ eling gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be ce@@ le@@ bra@@ ting play .
Q@@ u@@ ic@@ k example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy mot@@ to : people , ser@@ vice , prof@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er , they &apos;re ful@@ fil@@ led , they have a sense of ma@@ ster@@ y and pur@@ p@@ ose ."
"What happens ? They give better ser@@ vice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cu@@ sto@@ mers call for ser@@ vice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make deci@@ sions and are ful@@ fil@@ led , how do the cu@@ sto@@ mers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cu@@ sto@@ mers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ fe@@ eling cu@@ sto@@ mers ?"
"They bu@@ y more of your ser@@ vice and they tell more of their friends , which lea@@ ds to more prof@@ it ."
"P@@ eople , ser@@ vice , prof@@ it ."
"P@@ la@@ y incre@@ ases produ@@ c@@ tivity , not de@@ cre@@ ases ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Ge@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia ."
"N@@ o way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia , you guys . T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons ."
"One , play is uni@@ ver@@ sal ."
"There &apos;s nothing we@@ ird about B@@ ul@@ gar@@ i@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , be@@ si@@ des the ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me that we have to k@@ ic@@ k out ."
"T@@ w@@ o , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had zer@@ o happy cu@@ sto@@ mers ."
N@@ ot one cu@@ sto@@ mer would re@@ fer us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ gin@@ al prof@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ gin@@ al prof@@ its , and we had un@@ happy st@@ ak@@ e@@ hol@@ ders ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh some bas@@ ic change , change like im@@ pro@@ ving trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , change like pro@@ mot@@ ing self-@@ dire@@ ction and col@@ labor@@ ation , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging col@@ labor@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ cra@@ cy , the things like having a res@@ ul@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ focu@@ s ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the mor@@ ning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cu@@ sto@@ mer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organiz@@ ed with that .
Why do I care if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck ?
B@@ as@@ ically pro@@ mot@@ ing f@@ un .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh pro@@ mot@@ ing f@@ un and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three sh@@ ort years — s@@ ounds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cu@@ sto@@ mer , from zer@@ o to every cu@@ sto@@ mer re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing us , ab@@ o@@ ve a@@ verage prof@@ its for the indu@@ stry and happy st@@ ak@@ e@@ hol@@ ders ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did w@@ in , every year that we en@@ ter@@ ed , one of the ran@@ kin@@ gs for best emp@@ lo@@ yer for small business ."
In@@ de@@ pen@@ dent anal@@ y@@ sis from an@@ on@@ y@@ mous emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia ."
"There &apos;s nothing hol@@ ding us back , ex@@ cept our own men@@ tal@@ ity about play ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this re@@ v@@ olution through play .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the fe@@ eling of play in you , you need to re@@ disco@@ ver play ."
"W@@ hatever it was that as a k@@ id you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ j@@ oy@@ ed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pro@@ mo@@ tion you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be ser@@ i@@ ous , re@@ disco@@ ver it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ tain bi@@ king or read@@ ing a book or pla@@ ying a game .
"R@@ edi@@ s@@ co@@ ver that because you &apos;re the lea@@ ders , the inno@@ v@@ ation lea@@ ders , the thought lea@@ ders ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the of@@ fi@@ ce or talk to your friends and i@@ gn@@ ite the fir@@ e of change in the play re@@ v@@ olution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not fe@@ eling it , your col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tru@@ st you . &quot; &quot; We@@ ird con@@ cept : I hi@@ red you ; I should tru@@ st you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make deci@@ sions . I &apos;m going to emp@@ o@@ wer you , and I &apos;m going to de@@ le@@ g@@ ate to the lo@@ we@@ st level , rather than the top ."
I &apos;m going to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge con@@ stru@@ ctive cri@@ tic@@ ism .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
Because it &apos;s by challen@@ ging the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ ak out of the ru@@ t that we &apos;re in and create inno@@ va@@ tive solu@@ tions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as lea@@ ders .
We &apos;re going to er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ate fe@@ ar .
F@@ e@@ ar is the ene@@ my of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eli@@ min@@ ate re@@ stri@@ ctions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bile phone for person@@ al cal@@ ls — he@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d ."
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on in@@ st@@ ant mes@@ sen@@ gers .
Let them take long l@@ un@@ ches .
L@@ un@@ ch is like the re@@ cess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you w@@ ouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"L@@ et them do it . G@@ ive them some fre@@ e@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have f@@ un at the work@@ place ."
"We spend so much of our lives at the work@@ place , and it &apos;s su@@ p@@ posed to be , what , a mi@@ ser@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we w@@ ake up and say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this it ?"
I@@ s that all there was ? &quot; &quot; U@@ n@@ ac@@ cep@@ table . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in su@@ m@@ mar@@ y , we need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a work@@ ers &apos; re@@ v@@ olution ."
We don &apos;t need a work@@ ers &apos; re@@ v@@ olution .
What we need is a pla@@ yer@@ s &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pla@@ yer@@ s &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pla@@ yer@@ s &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing .
"S@@ er@@ i@@ ously , we need to b@@ and together . T@@ o@@ day is the start of the u@@ pri@@ sing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fla@@ mes of the re@@ v@@ olution . You need to go and share your ideas and your suc@@ cess stor@@ i@@ es@@ "
"@@ of what worked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ gor@@ ating our lives , our sch@@ o@@ ols , and our work with play ; about how play pro@@ mot@@ es a sense of pro@@ mi@@ se and self-@@ ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment ; of how play pro@@ mot@@ es inno@@ v@@ ation and produ@@ c@@ tivity , and , ulti@@ ma@@ tely , how play crea@@ tes me@@ an@@ ing ."
"Because we can &apos;t do it al@@ one . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a free no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life ha@@ ck , and all it re@@ qui@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audi@@ t of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves s@@ mal@@ ler ?
S@@ ome@@ times we h@@ old on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay atten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ cin@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particu@@ lar@@ ly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a sm@@ ile , or a con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a han@@ d@@ s@@ ha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ i@@ mes .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about non@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about communi@@ cation ."
"When we think about communi@@ cation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predi@@ ct really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pro@@ m@@ ote , who we ask out on a da@@ te ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ ini A@@ mb@@ ad@@ y , a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ versity , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predi@@ ct whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our fe@@ el@@ ings and our physi@@ ology ."
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ st . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interested in power dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
I became es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally interested in non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and do@@ min@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and do@@ min@@ ance ?
"So in the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , they are about exp@@ an@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you st@@ ret@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically open@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about open@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca T@@ ra@@ cy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves s@@ mal@@ ler . We don &apos;t mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the cla@@ ss@@ room , and what do I no@@ ti@@ ce ?"
"When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I no@@ ti@@ ce a couple of things about this .
So women are much more lik@@ ely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ o@@ men feel ch@@ ron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cla@@ ss@@ room , because parti@@ cip@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business sch@@ o@@ ols have been stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ cip@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some ev@@ iden@@ ce that they do .
"So , for example , we sm@@ ile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to sm@@ ile by hol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ et@@ h like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at ga@@ mes of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power le@@ ad@@ er that &apos;s do@@ min@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ bab@@ ly not , right ?"
"So we have this ev@@ iden@@ ce , both that the body can shap@@ e the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that r@@ ole changes can shap@@ e the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a r@@ ole change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tin@@ y man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , this tin@@ y inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be si@@ tting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prote@@ cting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it see@@ ms that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ a@@ tive si@@ tu@@ ations , like social thre@@ at si@@ tu@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being he@@ ck@@ led ."
P@@ eople ha@@ te this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re b@@ l@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis . They &apos;re b@@ l@@ ind to the con@@ di@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the presen@@ ce that they &apos;re br@@ in@@ ging to the spe@@ e@@ ch .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effe@@ ct , or medi@@ ating the effe@@ ct ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , rol@@ led sever@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had iden@@ ti@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ ik@@ e , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that fe@@ eling ."
"L@@ ik@@ e , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
D@@ o it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ al@@ ize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y twe@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .

"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity . In times of need , we need great crea@@ tivity ."
"D@@ is@@ cu@@ ss . Gre@@ at crea@@ tivity is as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly , ab@@ sur@@ dly , ra@@ tion@@ ally , ir@@ ra@@ tion@@ ally powerful ."
"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity can sp@@ read t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on fre@@ e@@ dom , make education see@@ m like a b@@ right idea ."
"( Laughter ) Gre@@ at crea@@ tivity can turn a sp@@ ot@@ light on de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation , or show that de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation a@@ in &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily so ."
"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity can make poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans elec@@ table , or par@@ ties un@@ elec@@ table ."
It can make war see@@ m like tra@@ ge@@ dy or far@@ ce .
C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity is the me@@ me@@ -@@ mak@@ er that pu@@ ts s@@ lo@@ g@@ ans on our t-@@ shi@@ r@@ ts and ph@@ ras@@ es on our li@@ ps .
It &apos;s the pa@@ th@@ fin@@ der that sho@@ ws us a simple ro@@ ad through an imp@@ en@@ et@@ ra@@ ble mor@@ al maz@@ e .
"S@@ ci@@ ence is cle@@ ver , but great crea@@ tivity is something less know@@ able , more ma@@ gi@@ cal . And now we need that ma@@ gi@@ c ."
This is a time of need .
"O@@ ur cli@@ mate is chan@@ ging quickly , too quickly ."
And great crea@@ tivity is needed to do what it does so well : to pro@@ v@@ ok@@ e us to think differ@@ ently with dra@@ ma@@ tic crea@@ tive sta@@ te@@ ments .
T@@ o temp@@ t us to act differ@@ ently with deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful crea@@ tive s@@ c@@ rap@@ s .
Here is one such s@@ cra@@ p from an in@@ iti@@ a@@ tive I &apos;m inv@@ olved in using crea@@ tivity to in@@ sp@@ ire people to be gre@@ en@@ er .
"( Video ) M@@ an : You know , rather than dri@@ ve today , I &apos;m going to walk ."
"N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : And so he wal@@ ked , and as he wal@@ ked he saw things ."
S@@ tran@@ ge and wonderful things he would not o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se have seen .
A de@@ er with an it@@ ch@@ y le@@ g . A f@@ lying mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle .
A father and da@@ u@@ ghter se@@ para@@ ted from a bi@@ cy@@ cle by a my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous w@@ all .
And then he st@@ opp@@ ed . W@@ al@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed with him through fiel@@ ds and bro@@ ken his heart .
"S@@ ure , she had a@@ ged a little ."
"In fact , she had a@@ ged a lot ."
But he felt all his old pas@@ sion for her re@@ turn .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ d , &quot; &quot; he called so@@ f@@ tly . F@@ or that was her name ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t say another word , G@@ u@@ st@@ y , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name ."
"&quot; &quot; I know a t@@ ent next to a c@@ ara@@ van , exactly 3@@ 00 yar@@ ds from here ."
"L@@ et &apos;s go there and make love . In the t@@ ent . &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ d un@@ d@@ res@@ sed . She sp@@ read one le@@ g , and then the other ."
"G@@ u@@ st@@ y en@@ ter@@ ed her b@@ ol@@ dly and made love to her r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ cally while she fil@@ med him , because she was a ke@@ en ama@@ te@@ ur por@@ no@@ grap@@ her ."
The ear@@ th mo@@ ved for both of them .
And they li@@ ved together happ@@ ily ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
"( Applause ) An@@ dy H@@ ob@@ s@@ ba@@ w@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the de@@ b@@ ate ."
The mor@@ al im@@ per@@ a@@ tive is on the table .
"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sh@@ ar@@ p ."
T@@ o make it conne@@ ct . T@@ o make it make people want to act .
"So this is a call , a ple@@ a , to the incredi@@ bly tal@@ en@@ ted TED community ."
Let &apos;s get crea@@ tive against cli@@ mate change .
And let &apos;s do it so@@ on . Thank you .
( Applause )
"Be@@ a@@ u L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . R@@ ight ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ di@@ ence : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ maz@@ ing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ di@@ ence : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
Au@@ di@@ ence : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . R@@ ight ?"
"It liter@@ ally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ight ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . R@@ ight ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our experience .
"R@@ ight ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ ing@@ less information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was u@@ se@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? W@@ hi@@ ch means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this f@@ ro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavi@@ or that &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ y@@ ed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hop@@ es , our dre@@ a@@ ms , the c@@ lo@@ the@@ s we we@@ ar , fal@@ ling in love , everything begin@@ s with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions be@@ gin in the same way ."
They be@@ gin with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ da@@ tor , it &apos;s too late ."
O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ as@@ ic@@ k@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"R@@ ight ? If you go down be@@ low on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner e@@ ars are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m standing still ."
"Y@@ our brain cannot deal with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dan@@ ger@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the ir@@ on@@ y is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tun@@ ately , ev@@ olution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life be@@ gin , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ yon@@ d the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ pp@@ ing into that space ."
So what is ev@@ olution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ la@@ y is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually ce@@ le@@ bra@@ ted . U@@ n@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play f@@ un .
"R@@ ight ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . R@@ ight ? It open@@ s possi@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ a@@ tive . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bon@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ la@@ y is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not defin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od se@@ ction of a p@@ aper .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is crea@@ tive ."
"So if you ad@@ d ru@@ les to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 e@@ igh@@ t@@ - to 10@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ en@@ a down to a small school in Dev@@ on , and the a@@ im of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . R@@ ight ?"
The first step was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fun@@ ding for this study because the scienti@@ sts said small children couldn &apos;t make a u@@ se@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . R@@ ight ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small pr@@ int so you w@@ ouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . P@@ o@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science publi@@ cation the last five to 15 years . R@@ ight ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant to exper@@ t scienti@@ sts .
"Now here , I want to share the st@@ age with someone quite speci@@ al . R@@ ight ?"
"S@@ he was one of the young people who was inv@@ olved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scienti@@ sts in the world . R@@ ight ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to st@@ age , will be the youn@@ gest person to ever spe@@ ak at TED . R@@ ight ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the person@@ i@@ fi@@ cation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you ple@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es Pro@@ je@@ ct , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ o@@ ole : Thank you , Be@@ a@@ u . We thought that it was easy to see the lin@@ k between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look al@@ ik@@ e ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible lin@@ k with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought si@@ mi@@ lar , since they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might sol@@ ve comple@@ x problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new si@@ tu@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned ru@@ les and con@@ di@@ tions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ se@@ ct with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can reco@@ gn@@ ize a good flo@@ wer re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any an@@ gle they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a game . So the kids went off and they desig@@ ned this experim@@ ent , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The p@@ uz@@ z@@ le we came up with was an if@@ -@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain col@@ or , but to a certain col@@ or flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain patter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ w@@ ers if the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ w@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the b@@ lue , or if the b@@ lue flo@@ w@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different ru@@ les the be@@ es can learn to sol@@ ve this p@@ uz@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really ex@@ c@@ iting about this project was we , and Be@@ a@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a c@@ lue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a te@@ ac@@ her not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ di@@ t goes to Da@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k , who was the col@@ labor@@ at@@ or on this project . O@@ kay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is ob@@ serv@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ ser@@ va@@ tions . They &apos;re recor@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es f@@ ly ."
( Video ) Da@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
Da@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Ye@@ ah .
"Da@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : So you keep tra@@ ck of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : R@@ ight ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ ser@@ va@@ tions . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , a@@ ver@@ a@@ ging , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to wr@@ ite this up and try to sub@@ mit this for publi@@ cation . R@@ ight ? So we have to wr@@ ite it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a p@@ aper has four different se@@ ctions : an in@@ tro@@ du@@ ction , a me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , a res@@ ul@@ ts , a dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion ."
"The in@@ tro@@ du@@ ction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ds , what did you do ? R@@ es@@ ul@@ ts , what was the ob@@ serv@@ ation ?"
"And the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? R@@ ight ?"
"That &apos;s a science p@@ aper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive , which means that this p@@ aper is wr@@ it@@ ten in ki@@ d@@ spe@@ ak ."
"It &apos;s not wr@@ it@@ ten by me . It &apos;s wr@@ it@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the cla@@ ss . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science p@@ aper begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; On@@ ce up@@ on a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The res@@ ul@@ ts se@@ ction , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining ph@@ ase , the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; s@@ mi@@ ley face . R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) This is a science p@@ aper . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle pa@@ ge . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in b@@ old are e@@ ight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton P@@ ri@@ mar@@ y S@@ ch@@ ool , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ en@@ ced , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ mit it to a public ac@@ cess jour@@ n@@ al , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the p@@ aper fa@@ il@@ s our in@@ iti@@ al qu@@ ality control che@@ cks in sever@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once up@@ on a time , &quot; &quot; the fi@@ gu@@ res are in cra@@ yon , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vie@@ wed . So I s@@ ent it to D@@ al@@ e P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the Na@@ tional A@@ cade@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the le@@ ad@@ ing neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most ori@@ gin@@ al science p@@ aper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly de@@ ser@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The p@@ aper is ma@@ g@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be publi@@ s@@ ha@@ ble if done by a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We sen@@ d it back to the edi@@ tor .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ at@@ ali@@ e He@@ m@@ pe@@ l to wr@@ ite a com@@ men@@ tar@@ y si@@ tu@@ ating the fin@@ din@@ gs for scienti@@ sts , right , pu@@ tting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vie@@ wed by five inde@@ pen@@ dent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . O@@ kay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) T@@ y@@ pi@@ cal science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scienti@@ sts in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ di@@ tors &apos; C@@ ho@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science ma@@ gaz@@ ine ."
It &apos;s for@@ ever fre@@ ely ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sible by Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only p@@ aper that will ever be fre@@ ely ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sible by this jour@@ n@@ al .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded p@@ aper by Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scienti@@ sts and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; re@@ cen@@ tly . I don &apos;t have words to expla@@ in exactly how I am fe@@ eling right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , inno@@ c@@ ence and ze@@ al are the most bas@@ ic and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ ali@@ ties more than children ?
P@@ le@@ ase con@@ gra@@ tu@@ late your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a physi@@ cal met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Ye@@ ah ye@@ ah . O@@ kay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredi@@ ble risk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . R@@ ight ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ hi@@ m@@ on S@@ cho@@ c@@ ken : R@@ ight , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . R@@ ight . O@@ kay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ app@@ ing . All right ?"
"( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) ( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) O@@ kay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) B@@ r@@ il@@ li@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) Wh@@ ere &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"R@@ ight ? We nor@@ m@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . Wh@@ en he open@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the possi@@ bility to step on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about gi@@ ving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pre@@ ss that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this sh@@ ort story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really ex@@ c@@ iting for me , because it b@@ rought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it sho@@ wed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the pot@@ ential to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."
C@@ han@@ ging the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all de@@ pen@@ ds on the way the person fe@@ els about change .
"But chan@@ ging the way I thought about science was surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly easy . On@@ ce we pla@@ y@@ ed the ga@@ mes and then started to think about the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ je@@ ct , and that any@@ one can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opport@@ unity . My opport@@ unity came in the form of Be@@ a@@ u , and the B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ e Pro@@ je@@ ct ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the big@@ gest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ viron@@ men@@ tal@@ ist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and p@@ aper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and p@@ aper .
"B@@ ot@@ to@@ m line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to li@@ st some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water .
T@@ w@@ o billion people without san@@ it@@ ation .
There are sever@@ al million people d@@ ying of HI@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two bil@@ lions of people who will be sever@@ ely af@@ fe@@ cted by cli@@ mate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would sol@@ ve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually sol@@ ve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy ses@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king ourselves , which ones should we sol@@ ve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We iden@@ ti@@ fied 10 of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges in the world , and I will just bri@@ ef@@ ly read them : cli@@ mate change , comm@@ un@@ ic@@ able dise@@ ases , con@@ fli@@ cts , education , finan@@ cial in@@ sta@@ bility , govern@@ ance and cor@@ rup@@ tion , mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion and hun@@ ger , population mi@@ gra@@ tion , san@@ it@@ ation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and tra@@ de bar@@ ri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ as@@ s the big@@ gest problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the big@@ gest things ?"
Wh@@ ere should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ av@@ os in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to focu@@ s on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t sol@@ ve problems .
Su@@ re@@ ly the big@@ gest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to sol@@ ve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze solu@@ tions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more compli@@ cated .
T@@ o cli@@ mate change that would be like K@@ y@@ ot@@ o .
"T@@ o comm@@ un@@ ic@@ able dise@@ ases , it might be health c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s or mos@@ qui@@ to ne@@ ts ."
"T@@ o con@@ fli@@ cts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ac@@ ek@@ e@@ ep@@ ing for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an im@@ possible tas@@ k — wr@@ ite down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economi@@ cs gets ev@@ il — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st ?
"P@@ le@@ ase , just take 30 secon@@ ds , perhaps talk to your neigh@@ b@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ ori@@ ties and the bot@@ to@@ m pri@@ ori@@ ties of the solu@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s big@@ gest issu@@ es ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sions af@@ ter@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a li@@ st never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ za@@ tion is incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
No@@ body wan@@ ts to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organiz@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a li@@ st ."
But every organiz@@ ation would also ha@@ te to be not on the top of the li@@ st .
"And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one sp@@ ots on the li@@ st than there is number ones , it makes per@@ fect sense not to want to do such a li@@ st ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fun@@ da@@ mental li@@ st of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ za@@ tion , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing , if only imp@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ lik@@ ely to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ za@@ tion , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a si@@ tu@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ices ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pri@@ ces , n@@ or the siz@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ ma@@ gine going into a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u car@@ d , but you have no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"You know , you have a p@@ iz@@ za ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"It could be at one dol@@ lar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a fa@@ mil@@ y@@ -@@ size p@@ iz@@ za ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size p@@ iz@@ za , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pri@@ ces on these issu@@ es .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economi@@ sts , three in each area ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top economi@@ sts wr@@ ite about cli@@ mate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the ben@@ ef@@ it of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se in comm@@ un@@ ic@@ able dise@@ ases .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top exper@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pri@@ ce ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top economi@@ sts , e@@ ight of the world &apos;s top economi@@ sts , inclu@@ ding three No@@ be@@ l Lau@@ re@@ a@@ tes , me@@ et in C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen in M@@ ay 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ a@@ mb@@ ri@@ dge Uni@@ versity pre@@ fe@@ cts decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of economi@@ cs .
"That works very well in Euro@@ pe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ed li@@ st .
"And then you ask , why economi@@ sts ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about malar@@ ia , you ask a malar@@ ia exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about cli@@ mate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ ologi@@ st ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask e@@ ither of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what economi@@ sts do .
They pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ sting tas@@ k of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ wards ?"
"So this is the li@@ st , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ site , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a li@@ st where they said there were bad proje@@ cts — basically , proje@@ cts where if you inve@@ st a dol@@ lar , you get less than a dol@@ lar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fa@@ ir proje@@ cts , good proje@@ cts and very good proje@@ cts ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good proje@@ cts we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from bac@@ k@@ wards so that we end up with the best proje@@ cts .
These were the bad proje@@ cts .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st was cli@@ mate change .
"This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t come back , e@@ ither ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cu@@ ri@@ ous ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with on the li@@ st that you wr@@ ote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ ot@@ o — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ ot@@ o — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very ine@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ ming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the a@@ verage of all ma@@ cro@@ economic mode@@ ls , is that K@@ y@@ ot@@ o , if everyone a@@ gre@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develop@@ ment a@@ id that we give the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mode@@ ls show it will pos@@ t@@ p@@ one war@@ ming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ an@@ gla@@ de@@ sh who gets a flo@@ od in 2@@ 100 can wa@@ it until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
"W@@ hi@@ ch is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually es@@ ti@@ mate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could sol@@ ve all maj@@ or bas@@ ic problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water , san@@ it@@ ation , bas@@ ic heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend tw@@ ice the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ or@@ ity ."
"The fa@@ ir proje@@ cts — no@@ ti@@ ce I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but comm@@ un@@ ic@@ able dise@@ ases , scale of bas@@ ic health serv@@ ices — just made it , simply because , y@@ es , scale of bas@@ ic health serv@@ ices is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very cos@@ tly ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what it tel@@ ls us is su@@ d@@ den@@ ly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good proje@@ cts , a lot of san@@ it@@ ation and water proje@@ cts came in ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , san@@ it@@ ation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also cos@@ ts a lot of inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ ori@@ ties which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is malar@@ ia — de@@ al@@ ing with malar@@ ia .
The in@@ ci@@ den@@ ce of malar@@ ia is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get in@@ fe@@ cted every year .
It might even cost up to@@ wards a per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge point of G@@ D@@ P every year for af@@ fe@@ cted na@@ tions .
"If we inv@@ ested about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ ci@@ den@@ ce down to half ."
"We could av@@ o@@ id about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people d@@ ying , but perhaps more imp@@ or@@ tan@@ tly , we could av@@ o@@ id about a &#91; million &#93; people getting in@@ fe@@ cted every year ."
"We would sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly incre@@ ase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global war@@ ming ."
This third best one was free tra@@ de .
"B@@ as@@ ically , the model sho@@ wed that if we could get free tra@@ de , and es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally cut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.@@ S@@ . and Euro@@ pe , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global economy to an as@@ t@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would ac@@ cru@@ e to the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , the point is to say that we could actually pul@@ l two to three hun@@ d@@ red million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very radi@@ cally f@@ ast , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focu@@ s on mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion .
"N@@ ot just mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very che@@ ap way of de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion , na@@ me@@ ly , the la@@ ck of mi@@ c@@ ron@@ u@@ tri@@ ents ."
"B@@ as@@ ically , about half of the world &apos;s population is la@@ c@@ king in ir@@ on , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and v@@ it@@ am@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inve@@ st about 12 billion dollars , we could make a sev@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best inve@@ st@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to focu@@ s on HI@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if we inve@@ st 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next e@@ ight years , we could av@@ o@@ id 2@@ 8 new million cas@@ es of HI@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what this does and what it focu@@ ses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HI@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do e@@ ither , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inve@@ st first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more ex@@ pen@@ sive than pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So basically , what this focu@@ ses on is saying , we can do a lot more by inve@@ sting in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"B@@ as@@ ically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So again , what we focu@@ s on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first rate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity li@@ st and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is cli@@ mate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ lik@@ ely that we should do that ."
"We should also do cli@@ mate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focu@@ s on problems , that we focu@@ s on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling , one of the parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the cli@@ mate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er ."
E@@ ven the most pe@@ s@@ si@@ mi@@ stic imp@@ act s@@ cen@@ ar@@ i@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
es@@ ti@@ mate that the a@@ verage person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as ri@@ ch as we are today .
"M@@ u@@ ch more lik@@ ely , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or help@@ ing people in B@@ an@@ gla@@ de@@ sh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a po@@ or B@@ an@@ gla@@ de@@ sh@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money help@@ ing a little , 100 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real po@@ or people , right now , in B@@ an@@ gla@@ de@@ sh , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling put it , imagine if you were a ri@@ ch — as you will be — a ri@@ ch Ch@@ in@@ ese , a ri@@ ch B@@ oli@@ vi@@ an , a ri@@ ch Con@@ g@@ ol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about help@@ ing me a little bit through cli@@ mate change , and car@@ ed so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about help@@ ing my gran@@ d@@ father and my great gran@@ d@@ father , wh@@ om they could have help@@ ed so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ ori@@ ties stra@@ ight ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the ty@@ pi@@ cal way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because cli@@ mate change has good pic@@ tures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay Af@@ ter T@@ o@@ mor@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expe@@ ct E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to c@@ ast B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next movi@@ e di@@ g@@ ging la@@ tr@@ ines in Tan@@ z@@ an@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movi@@ e ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion of pri@@ ori@@ ties as a def@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
T@@ o make sure that we real@@ ize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media atten@@ tion , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other obje@@ ctions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a fal@@ se cho@@ ice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly a@@ gre@@ e ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the develop@@ ed world decided we were going to spend tw@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ ince then our a@@ id has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the pat@@ h of su@@ d@@ den@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real issu@@ e here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I should just men@@ tion bri@@ ef@@ ly , is this really the right li@@ st that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economi@@ sts , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably end up as@@ king old , wh@@ ite American men ."
"And they &apos;re not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually in@@ vi@@ ted 80 young people from all over the world to come and sol@@ ve the same problem .
"The only two re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments were that they were stu@@ d@@ ying at the uni@@ versity , and they sp@@ ok@@ e En@@ gli@@ sh ."
"The maj@@ or@@ ity of them were , first , from develop@@ ing countries ."
"They had all the same materi@@ al but they could go v@@ as@@ tly outside the s@@ cop@@ e of dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts ."
And the surpri@@ sing thing was that the li@@ st was very si@@ mi@@ lar — with mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion and dise@@ ases at the top and cli@@ mate change at the bot@@ to@@ m .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ars and uni@@ versity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same li@@ st .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a pat@@ h a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ ori@@ ties , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
M@@ ap out the right pat@@ h for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
"T@@ o start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ mous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be hon@@ est and f@@ ran@@ k about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ ori@@ ties , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A cu@@ ri@@ ous little inven@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tin@@ y little li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms that are in@@ vi@@ sible to the n@@ ak@@ ed eye .
So@@ on comes the medi@@ cal disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms are actually ca@@ uses of ter@@ ri@@ ble human dise@@ ases .
"I@@ ma@@ gine what happened to the society when they realized that an En@@ gli@@ sh mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was dr@@ in@@ king a mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from L@@ on@@ don ."
F@@ ast for@@ ward 200 years .
"We still have this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken h@@ old in the develop@@ ing countries around the tro@@ pi@@ cal bel@@ t ."
"@@ Ju@@ st for malar@@ ia itself , there are a million de@@ a@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be te@@ s@@ ted because they are at risk for different species of malar@@ i@@ al in@@ fe@@ ctions ."
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ ster@@ s .
"You take a sta@@ in , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine oran@@ ge or a f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent sta@@ in or G@@ i@@ em@@ sa , and a mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"Wh@@ y is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in Ken@@ ya , F@@ ati@@ ma in B@@ an@@ gla@@ de@@ sh , N@@ av@@ j@@ oo@@ t in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , and Ju@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ gan@@ da still wa@@ it months to be able to dia@@ gn@@ ose why they are si@@ ck ?"
And that &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ ily because scal@@ ability of the dia@@ gn@@ os@@ tics is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem li@@ es with the mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e itself .
"E@@ ven though the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of modern science , research mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es are not desig@@ ned for field te@@ sting ."
Ne@@ ither were they first desig@@ ned for dia@@ gn@@ os@@ tics at all .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , bul@@ k@@ y , really hard to ma@@ in@@ tain , and cost a lot of money ."
This picture is Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ an@@ d@@ hi in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for dia@@ gn@@ os@@ ing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his as@@ h@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ a@@ gra@@ m in India .
"T@@ w@@ o of my students , J@@ im and J@@ a@@ mes , tra@@ ve@@ led around India and T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of don@@ ated equ@@ ip@@ ment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us gro@@ wing on mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e len@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a fun@@ c@@ tional mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ cop@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ cop@@ e ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ cop@@ e is a completely fun@@ c@@ tional mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e , a pla@@ t@@ form for f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ c@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field , pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation , proje@@ ction , all kinds of ad@@ van@@ ced mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ y built pu@@ re@@ ly by fol@@ ding p@@ aper ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exa@@ mp@@ les here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
What you see here is all the possible comp@@ on@@ ents to build a fun@@ c@@ tional bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field and f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ c@@ ence mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e .
"So , there are three sta@@ ges : There is the op@@ tical st@@ age , the il@@ lu@@ min@@ ation st@@ age and the mas@@ k@@ -@@ hol@@ ding st@@ age ."
And there are mi@@ c@@ r@@ o op@@ tics at the bot@@ to@@ m that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the p@@ aper itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are pla@@ ying like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I bre@@ ak it off ."
This p@@ aper has no in@@ stru@@ ctions and no langu@@ a@@ ges .
"There is a co@@ de , a col@@ or co@@ de em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that tel@@ ls you exactly how to f@@ old that speci@@ fic mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties of a stan@@ d@@ ard mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ e , just like an X@@ Y st@@ age , a place where a sa@@ mple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stan@@ d@@ ard that &apos;s been op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ed for over the years , and many health work@@ ers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what changes , but the stan@@ d@@ ard sta@@ ins all re@@ ma@@ in the same for many different dise@@ ases ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y st@@ age , and then there is a focu@@ sing st@@ age , which is a fle@@ x@@ ure me@@ chan@@ ism that &apos;s built in p@@ aper itself that allo@@ ws us to move and focu@@ s the len@@ ses by mi@@ c@@ r@@ on ste@@ ps ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this obje@@ ct , and my students ha@@ te when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ g@@ ged dev@@ ices ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to sto@@ mp on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re desig@@ ned from a very fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble materi@@ al , like p@@ aper ."
"A@@ no@@ ther f@@ un fact is , this is what we actually sen@@ d out there as a stan@@ d@@ ard dia@@ gn@@ os@@ tic to@@ ol , but here in this en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ s@@ cop@@ es of different con@@ fi@@ gu@@ ra@@ tions all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pic@@ k one ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually desig@@ ned speci@@ f@@ ically for malar@@ ia , because it has the f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent fil@@ ters built speci@@ f@@ ically for dia@@ gn@@ os@@ ing malar@@ ia ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic dia@@ gn@@ os@@ tic mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es comes out of this .
"So up ti@@ ll now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the li@@ ghts , ple@@ ase , it turns out fol@@ d@@ s@@ cop@@ es are also proje@@ ction mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es ."
"I have these two mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ se@@ ction of a comp@@ ound eye , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m in clos@@ er , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is ."
You actually see how the len@@ ses are cut together in the c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ se@@ ction patter@@ n .
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fav@@ or@@ ite in@@ se@@ cts , I love to ha@@ te this one , is a mos@@ qui@@ to , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ na of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ en@@ s ."
R@@ ight there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually des@@ cri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been field te@@ sting some of our mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es by was@@ h@@ ing my c@@ lo@@ the@@ s wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the dr@@ yer .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also sho@@ ws you how the proje@@ ction s@@ cop@@ e works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s proje@@ cted and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it cos@@ ts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the big@@ gest idea was rol@@ l-@@ to@@ -@@ rol@@ l man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 cen@@ ts of parts and cos@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allo@@ ws us to do is to think about a new para@@ di@@ g@@ m in mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ y , which we call u@@ se@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ th@@ row mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ y ."
I &apos;m going to give you a quic@@ k s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
These are the three sta@@ ges that you actually see .
"And the op@@ tical comp@@ on@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture len@@ ses in p@@ aper itself at really high throu@@ gh@@ pu@@ ts , so it uses a process of self-@@ as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly and surface ten@@ sion to build ach@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic len@@ ses in the p@@ aper itself ."
So that &apos;s where the len@@ ses go .
There are some light sour@@ ces .
"And essen@@ ti@@ ally , in the end , all the parts line up because of ori@@ ga@@ mi , because of the fact that ori@@ ga@@ mi allo@@ ws us mi@@ c@@ ron@@ -@@ scale pre@@ ci@@ sion of op@@ tical ali@@ gn@@ ment ."
"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the as@@ pe@@ cts of engine@@ ering that go in something like this are fa@@ ir@@ ly s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cated ."
"So here is another obvi@@ ous thing that we would do , ty@@ pic@@ ally , if I was going to show that these mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es are ro@@ bu@@ st , is go to the third flo@@ or and dro@@ p it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it survi@@ ves ."
"So for us , the next step actually is really fin@@ ish@@ ing our field tri@@ als ."
We are star@@ ting at the end of the su@@ m@@ mer .
We are at a st@@ age where we &apos;ll be making thousands of mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field tri@@ als with the high@@ est den@@ si@@ ty of mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ es ever at a given place .
"We &apos;ve started colle@@ cting data for malar@@ ia , C@@ ha@@ g@@ as disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from pati@@ ents themselves ."
And I want to leave you with this picture .
"I had not anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted this before , but a really interesting lin@@ k between han@@ d@@ s@@ -@@ on science education and global health ."
What are the to@@ ols that we &apos;re actually provi@@ ding the kids who are going to fi@@ ght this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p for to@@ mor@@ row ?
I would love for them to be able to just pr@@ int out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ cop@@ e and car@@ ry them around in their po@@ c@@ ket@@ s .
Thank you .
( Applause )
O@@ ur world has many su@@ per@@ her@@ o@@ es .
But they have the wor@@ st of all su@@ per@@ po@@ w@@ ers : in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
"H@@ ere in B@@ raz@@ il , they colle@@ ct 9@@ 0 percent of all the was@@ te that &apos;s actually re@@ cy@@ c@@ led ."
"M@@ ost of the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es work inde@@ pen@@ den@@ tly , pic@@ king was@@ te from the stre@@ ets and sel@@ ling to j@@ un@@ k yar@@ ds at very low pri@@ ces ."
"They may colle@@ ct over 3@@ 00 kil@@ os in their ba@@ gs , sh@@ opp@@ ing car@@ ts , bi@@ cy@@ c@@ les and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as ."
"C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from wo@@ od or met@@ al and found in sever@@ al stre@@ ets in B@@ raz@@ il , much like gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i and stre@@ et art ."
And this is how I first met these mar@@ gin@@ al@@ ized su@@ per@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"I am a gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i arti@@ st and ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st and my art is social , environ@@ mental and political in nature ."
"In 200@@ 7 , I took my work be@@ yon@@ d wal@@ ls and on@@ to the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new ur@@ b@@ an supp@@ ort for my messa@@ ge ."
"But at this time , gi@@ ving vo@@ ice to the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es ."
"B@@ y ad@@ ding art and h@@ um@@ or to the cause , it became more appe@@ al@@ ing , which help@@ ed call atten@@ tion to the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es and im@@ pro@@ ve their self-@@ es@@ te@@ e@@ m ."
"And also , they are fa@@ mous now on the stre@@ ets , on mas@@ s media and social ."
"So , the thing is , I p@@ l@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not st@@ opp@@ ed working since ."
I have pain@@ ted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been in@@ vi@@ ted to do ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions and tri@@ ps wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
"And then I realized that cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es , in their in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility , are not ex@@ clu@@ sive to B@@ raz@@ il ."
"I met them in Ar@@ gen@@ tin@@ a , Ch@@ ile , B@@ oli@@ vi@@ a , S@@ outh Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in develop@@ ed countries such as the United States and Jap@@ an ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
"And then , I created a col@@ labor@@ a@@ tive mo@@ vement called P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded ev@@ ent ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded ev@@ ent to help cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"C@@ at@@ ad@@ or@@ es are as@@ si@@ s@@ ted by wel@@ l-@@ being profes@@ sion@@ als and heal@@ th@@ care , like physi@@ ci@@ ans , den@@ ti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ sts , ha@@ ir st@@ y@@ li@@ sts , mas@@ sa@@ ge ther@@ ap@@ ists and much more ."
"But also , they also rece@@ ive sa@@ f@@ ety shi@@ r@@ ts , g@@ lo@@ ves , ra@@ in@@ co@@ at@@ s and e@@ ye@@ gla@@ s@@ ses to see in high@@ -@@ defin@@ i@@ tion the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are ren@@ o@@ va@@ ted by our incredi@@ ble v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers ."
"And then they rece@@ ive sa@@ f@@ ety ite@@ ms , too : re@@ fle@@ ctive t@@ ap@@ es , hor@@ ns and mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bile art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
"P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the stre@@ ets of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o , Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ u@@ ri@@ ti@@ ba ."
"But to me@@ et the de@@ m@@ and in other cities , inclu@@ ding outside of B@@ raz@@ il , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is in@@ spi@@ red by TE@@ D@@ x , and it &apos;s a simp@@ li@@ fied , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded edi@@ tion of P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a ."
So now everybody can jo@@ in .
"In two years , over 1@@ 70 cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es , 8@@ 00 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and 200 stre@@ et arti@@ sts and more than 1@@ ,000 don@@ ors have been inv@@ olved in the P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a mo@@ vement , wh@@ ose ac@@ tions have even been used in teach@@ ing re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling at a local school ."
So cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es are lea@@ ving in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility behind and be@@ coming incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly re@@ spe@@ cted and val@@ u@@ ed .
"Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es and other in@@ vi@@ sible su@@ per@@ her@@ o@@ es from your city ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , reco@@ gn@@ ize them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , th@@ ank you ."
( Applause ) .
"A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tual Earth , b@@ rought me over to become the archi@@ te@@ ct of B@@ ing M@@ ap@@ s , which is M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ m@@ app@@ ing ef@@ for@@ t ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ defin@@ ing the way m@@ ap@@ s work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of m@@ app@@ ing and dire@@ ction site that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might no@@ ti@@ ce about the m@@ app@@ ing site is just the f@@ lu@@ i@@ di@@ ty of the z@@ oo@@ ming and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re famili@@ ar at all with Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ app@@ ing is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ graph@@ y , it &apos;s also about ima@@ ger@@ y ."
"So , as we z@@ oo@@ m@@ -@@ in be@@ yon@@ d a certain level this res@@ ol@@ ves into a kind of S@@ im C@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ like vir@@ tual view at 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es ."
"This can be vie@@ wed from any of the car@@ din@@ al dire@@ ctions to show you the 3@@ D stru@@ cture of the city , all the fac@@ a@@ des ."
"Now , we see this space , this thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al environment , as being a can@@ v@@ as on which all sor@@ ts of app@@ li@@ ca@@ tions can play out , and ma@@ p &apos;s dire@@ ctions are really just one of them ."
"If you cli@@ ck on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve la@@ un@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the dis@@ as@@ ter in Ha@@ it@@ i , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ma@@ p that sho@@ wed before and after pic@@ tures from the sk@@ y ."
"This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ local blo@@ gs in real time and m@@ app@@ ing those stories , those en@@ tries to the places that are re@@ fer@@ red to on the blo@@ gs ."
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more can@@ dy sort of stuff .
"So , we see the ima@@ ger@@ y , of course , not st@@ opp@@ ing at the sk@@ y ."
These little gre@@ en bu@@ b@@ b@@ les re@@ present ph@@ ot@@ osy@@ n@@ ths that us@@ ers have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them e@@ ither , but ph@@ ot@@ osy@@ n@@ ths are in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into the ma@@ p ."
E@@ very@@ thing that &apos;s cas@@ ed in b@@ lue is an area where we &apos;ve taken ima@@ ger@@ y on the ground as well .
"And so , when you f@@ ly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . Wh@@ en you f@@ ly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ a@@ mic ima@@ ger@@ y , the first thing that you might no@@ ti@@ ce is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al under@@ standing of this environment as there is of the thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al city from ab@@ o@@ ve , so if I cli@@ ck on something to get a clos@@ er view of it , then , the fact that that tran@@ si@@ tion looks as it does , is a fun@@ ction of all of that ge@@ ome@@ try , all of that 3@@ D under@@ standing behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a f@@ un ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a col@@ labor@@ ation with our friends at F@@ li@@ ck@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ li@@ ck@@ r , ge@@ or@@ e@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed ima@@ ger@@ y and uses ph@@ ot@@ osy@@ n@@ th@@ -@@ like pro@@ ce@@ s@@ ses to conne@@ ct that ima@@ ger@@ y to our ima@@ ger@@ y , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pul@@ l up , but — ( Laughter ) But no@@ ti@@ ce — this is , of course , a popu@@ lar tou@@ ri@@ st site , and there are lots of photo@@ s around here , and these photo@@ s are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ li@@ ck@@ r ph@@ ot@@ o , that &apos;s our ima@@ ger@@ y ."
"So you really see how this kind of cro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced ima@@ ger@@ y is in@@ te@@ gra@@ ting , in a very de@@ ep way , into the ma@@ p itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are sever@@ al reas@@ ons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time tra@@ vel ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful hi@@ stor@@ ic ima@@ ger@@ y in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ a@@ ges and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s co@@ ol about this is that , not only is it au@@ g@@ men@@ ting this vis@@ ual re@@ presen@@ tation of the world with things that are coming in from us@@ ers , but it also is the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be sho@@ wing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a tran@@ si@@ tion in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , no@@ ti@@ ce there &apos;s now a ro@@ of ab@@ o@@ ve us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ ik@@ e P@@ la@@ ce Mar@@ ket .
"And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ k ca@@ mera , so , we &apos;re now not only ima@@ ging in the stre@@ et with this ca@@ mera on top@@ s of c@@ ars , but we &apos;re also ima@@ ging inside ."
"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of regi@@ stra@@ tion , not only of still ima@@ ges , but also of video ."
"So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , tru@@ ly , very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) OK .
"( R@@ in@@ ging ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( No@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m h@@ it@@ ting it . I &apos;m p@@ un@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ ik@@ e P@@ la@@ ce Mar@@ ket , the la@@ b ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting this live .
"O@@ K , Ge@@ or@@ ge , can you p@@ an back over to the cor@@ ner market ?"
Because I want to show poin@@ ts of inter@@ est .
"N@@ o , no . The other way ."
"Y@@ e@@ ah , ye@@ ah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , OK , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these poin@@ ts of inter@@ est over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the s@@ po@@ t , you can think about this — this is taking a step in ad@@ di@@ tion to au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"What the h@@ ell are you guys — o@@ h , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m han@@ ging up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and th@@ ank the team ."
They &apos;ve done a fan@@ tas@@ tic job of pul@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ an@@ don them now and walk back outside .
"And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for tele@@ presen@@ ce , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the s@@ po@@ t , for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"When you use it on the s@@ po@@ t , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that me@@ ta@@ data and information about the world to you ."
"So here , we &apos;re taking the ex@@ tr@@ a step of also bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting it ."
"That was being bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast , by the way , on a 4@@ G net@@ work from the market ."
"A@@ ll right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t has given in the past sever@@ al years ."
"And that &apos;s C@@ ur@@ ti@@ s W@@ ong , Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ ide T@@ ele@@ s@@ cop@@ e ."
"So , we &apos;re going to head over to the du@@ mp@@ ster@@ s , where it &apos;s tradi@@ tional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a bre@@ ak , but also st@@ are up at the sk@@ y ."
This is the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ ide T@@ ele@@ s@@ cop@@ e into our m@@ ap@@ s .
"( Applause ) This is the cur@@ r@@ ent — th@@ ank you — this is the cur@@ r@@ ent time . If we s@@ cru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sk@@ y will look at different times , and we can get all of this very de@@ ta@@ i@@ led information about different times , different da@@ tes : Let &apos;s move the mo@@ on a little high@@ er in the sk@@ y , maybe change the da@@ te ."
I would like to kind of z@@ oo@@ m in on the mo@@ on .
"So , this is an as@@ tron@@ omi@@ cally comple@@ te re@@ presen@@ tation of the sk@@ y in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted right into the Earth ."
"A@@ ll right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop ."
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from Pro@@ vi@@ den@@ ce , R@@ ho@@ de I@@ s@@ land to P@@ ort@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ads through state par@@ ks and national for@@ est@@ s — basically the lon@@ gest rou@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mi@@ les ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me tot@@ ally b@@ lan@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a per@@ fect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mo@@ ments , and then she cra@@ cks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fa@@ mous Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about si@@ tu@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a st@@ range car@@ e@@ er move , but it actually has one great ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge : no job com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ stra@@ ct .
We all know everybody in this room makes mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is fal@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I h@@ old , here in the present ten@@ se , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ stra@@ ct ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of fal@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the present ten@@ se .
"So effe@@ cti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ v@@ eling through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of fe@@ eling very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our person@@ al and profes@@ sion@@ al lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us colle@@ cti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this fe@@ eling of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ v@@ ince you that it is possible to step outside of that fe@@ eling and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ a@@ test mor@@ al , in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tual and crea@@ tive lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this fe@@ eling of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a fe@@ eling of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ mb@@ ar@@ ras@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , e@@ mb@@ ar@@ ras@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to real@@ ize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ al@@ iz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating , it can be re@@ ve@@ la@@ tor@@ y , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my stu@@ p@@ id Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter mi@@ st@@ ake ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
D@@ o you remember that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s tot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and real@@ iz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he fal@@ ls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we real@@ ize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ re@@ ct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a stru@@ c@@ tu@@ ral reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this fe@@ eling of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this fe@@ eling as well — and this one is cul@@ tu@@ ral .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school .
"You &apos;re si@@ tting there in cla@@ ss , and your te@@ ac@@ her is han@@ ding back qu@@ iz p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not mine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ aper ."
"It &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b k@@ id , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his ho@@ me@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are laz@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es ."
We learn these really bad le@@ s@@ son@@ s really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ spe@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just be@@ coming per@@ fect little A students , per@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"R@@ ight , M@@ r. C@@ F@@ O , as@@ tro@@ physi@@ ci@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ m@@ ara@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , as@@ tro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ m@@ ara@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ ger@@ y ."
B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ osp@@ ital for Har@@ var@@ d — one of the best h@@ osp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing see@@ ms to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she w@@ ak@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ ges ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perfor@@ med a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el sp@@ ok@@ e about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or w@@ hatever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ sting too much in the fe@@ eling of being on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of anything can be very dan@@ ger@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ ide to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 200 million g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global economy ."
So this is a huge pra@@ c@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly re@@ fle@@ ct reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to expla@@ in all of those people who di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expla@@ in those people the same way , by re@@ sor@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone di@@ sa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with us , then we move on to a second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pi@@ e@@ ces of the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ re@@ c@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately di@@ st@@ ort@@ ing it for their own mal@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ as@@ tro@@ p@@ he .
This at@@ t@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ ep@@ s us from pre@@ ven@@ ting mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es when we absolu@@ tely need to and ca@@ uses us to tre@@ at each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ ling and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly trans@@ lu@@ cent win@@ do@@ ws and we just gaz@@ e out of them and des@@ cri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to gaz@@ e out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ ra@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ tes said his fa@@ mous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , S@@ t@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ al@@ l@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine under@@ sto@@ od that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of e@@ mb@@ ar@@ ras@@ sing de@@ fect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fun@@ da@@ mental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ ses@@ sed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ ses@@ sion is the sour@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produ@@ c@@ tivity and crea@@ tivity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself list@@ en@@ ing to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American Li@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing and I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing , and at some point , I start fe@@ eling like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness la@@ dy .
"I just ima@@ gin@@ ed it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ la@@ ss , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we j@@ ok@@ e that every single ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ la@@ ss , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mo@@ ments of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ sal and wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audi@@ ence me@@ mb@@ ers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as re@@ a@@ ders , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se en@@ din@@ gs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to in@@ va@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a bun@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of mas@@ s de@@ stru@@ ction , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring democra@@ cy to the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i Mu@@ b@@ arak thought he was going to be the di@@ c@@ tat@@ or of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too si@@ ck and could pas@@ s the re@@ ig@@ ns of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ art and move back to your ho@@ me@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a bun@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ je@@ ct everybody ha@@ tes for an audi@@ ence that would never materi@@ al@@ ize .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredi@@ ble stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and as@@ ton@@ ish@@ es us ."
"N@@ o off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ um@@ ent to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just sp@@ ent an entire week talking about inno@@ va@@ tions and ad@@ van@@ ce@@ ments and im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those inno@@ va@@ tions and ad@@ van@@ ce@@ ments and im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ g@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) Di@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ac@@ k , Ch@@ r@@ is ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We h@@ old another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tin@@ y , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ as@@ t@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ ster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ ay@@ be I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
"O@@ n No@@ ve@@ mber 5@@ th , 199@@ 0 , a man na@@ med E@@ l-@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air wal@@ ked into a h@@ ot@@ el in Man@@ ha@@ tt@@ an and as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ated R@@ ab@@ bi M@@ e@@ ir Kah@@ an@@ e , the le@@ ad@@ er of the J@@ e@@ w@@ ish D@@ ef@@ en@@ se Le@@ a@@ gue ."
"N@@ os@@ air was in@@ iti@@ ally found not gu@@ il@@ ty of the m@@ ur@@ der , but while ser@@ ving time on le@@ ss@@ er char@@ ges , he and other men began plan@@ ning at@@ tac@@ ks on a do@@ z@@ en New York C@@ ity lan@@ d@@ mark@@ s , inclu@@ ding tun@@ ne@@ ls , sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the United N@@ ations he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters ."
"Th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly , those plan@@ s were fo@@ i@@ led by an F@@ B@@ I in@@ for@@ man@@ t ."
"S@@ ad@@ ly , the 199@@ 3 bo@@ mb@@ ing of the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter was not ."
N@@ os@@ air would ev@@ en@@ tually be con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted for his inv@@ ol@@ vement in the p@@ lot .
E@@ l-@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
"I was born in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia in 19@@ 8@@ 3 to him , an E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an engine@@ er , and a lo@@ ving American mother and gra@@ de school te@@ ac@@ her , who together tried their best to create a happy chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od for me ."
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dy@@ na@@ mic started to change .
"My father ex@@ posed me to a side of I@@ sla@@ m that few people , inclu@@ ding the maj@@ or@@ ity of M@@ us@@ li@@ ms , get to see ."
"It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to inter@@ act with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to real@@ ize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , in every reli@@ gi@@ on , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of people who h@@ old so fer@@ ven@@ tly to their beli@@ ef@@ s that they feel they must use any means ne@@ cess@@ ary to make others live as they do ."
"A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ rest , he s@@ at me down and expla@@ ined that for the past few we@@ ek@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ ot@@ ing range on L@@ ong I@@ s@@ land for tar@@ get pra@@ cti@@ ce ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next mor@@ ning .
"We ar@@ ri@@ ved at C@@ al@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ ot@@ ing R@@ an@@ ge , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being wat@@ ched by the F@@ B@@ I ."
"When it was my turn to sh@@ oo@@ t , my father help@@ ed me h@@ old the ri@@ f@@ le to my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der and expla@@ ined how to a@@ im at the tar@@ get about 30 yar@@ ds off ."
"That day , the last bul@@ let I sho@@ t h@@ it the small oran@@ ge light that s@@ at on top of the tar@@ get and to everyone &apos;s surpri@@ se , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally mine , the entire tar@@ get bur@@ st into fla@@ mes ."
"My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in Ara@@ bi@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; L@@ ik@@ e father , like son ."
"They all see@@ med to get a really big la@@ u@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I ful@@ ly under@@ sto@@ od what they thought was so fun@@ ny ."
They thought they saw in me the same de@@ stru@@ ction my father was cap@@ able of .
"Th@@ ose men would ev@@ en@@ tually be con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted of pla@@ cing a van fil@@ led with 1@@ ,@@ 500 p@@ ounds of exp@@ los@@ i@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter &apos;s Nor@@ th T@@ o@@ wer , ca@@ using an exp@@ los@@ i@@ on that kil@@ led six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"These were the men I called am@@ mu , which means un@@ cle ."
"B@@ y the time I turned 1@@ 9 , I had already mo@@ ved 20 times in my life , and that in@@ sta@@ bility during my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od didn &apos;t really provi@@ de an opport@@ unity to make many friends ."
"E@@ ach time I would be@@ gin to feel com@@ for@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ac@@ k up and move to the next to@@ wn ."
"Be@@ ing the per@@ pet@@ ual new face in cla@@ ss , I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the tar@@ get of bul@@ li@@ es ."
"I ke@@ pt my iden@@ ti@@ ty a se@@ cre@@ t from my cla@@ ss@@ ma@@ tes to av@@ o@@ id being tar@@ ge@@ ted , but as it turns out , being the qui@@ et , ch@@ u@@ b@@ by new k@@ id in cla@@ ss was more than enough am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion ."
"So for the most part , I sp@@ ent my time at home read@@ ing book@@ s and wat@@ ching T@@ V or pla@@ ying video ga@@ mes ."
"I &apos;d been ra@@ i@@ sed to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , like a person &apos;s ra@@ ce or reli@@ gi@@ on ."
So what open@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that challen@@ ged this way of thinking was during the 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al elec@@ tions .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh a colle@@ ge pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the Na@@ tional Y@@ outh Con@@ ven@@ tion in P@@ hi@@ la@@ de@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a ."
"My particular group &apos;s focu@@ s was on y@@ outh viol@@ ence , and having been the v@@ ic@@ tim of bul@@ lying for most of my life , this was a sub@@ je@@ ct in which I felt particu@@ lar@@ ly pas@@ sion@@ ate ."
The me@@ mb@@ ers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ w@@ ish ."
"Now , it had taken sever@@ al days for this de@@ ta@@ il to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural anim@@ os@@ ity between the two of us ."
"I had never had a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish friend before , and f@@ ran@@ kly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a bar@@ ri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a su@@ m@@ mer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ den@@ s , an a@@ mu@@ se@@ ment par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sor@@ ts of fa@@ i@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fun@@ da@@ mental to the develop@@ ment of my charac@@ ter ."
"M@@ ost of my life , I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght that ho@@ mos@@ ex@@ u@@ ality was a sin , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion , that all g@@ ay people were a ne@@ ga@@ tive inf@@ lu@@ ence ."
"As chan@@ ce would have it , I had the opport@@ unity to work with some of the g@@ ay perfor@@ mers at a show there , and so@@ on found that many were the kin@@ de@@ st , least ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met ."
"Be@@ ing bul@@ li@@ ed as a k@@ id created a sense of emp@@ a@@ thy in me to@@ ward the su@@ ff@@ ering of others , and it comes very un@@ nat@@ ur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"Because of that fe@@ eling , I was able to con@@ tr@@ ast the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
"I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be g@@ ay , but I &apos;m well ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with being ju@@ d@@ ged for something that &apos;s be@@ yon@@ d my control ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The Da@@ ily S@@ how . &quot; &quot; O@@ n a ni@@ gh@@ tly bas@@ is , J@@ on S@@ te@@ w@@ art for@@ ced me to be in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tually hon@@ est with myself about my own big@@ ot@@ ry and help@@ ed me to real@@ ize that a person &apos;s ra@@ ce , reli@@ gi@@ on or se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ en@@ tation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one &apos;s charac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"I@@ n@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion can often come from an un@@ expe@@ cted place , and the fact that a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish co@@ medi@@ an had done more to pos@@ iti@@ vely inf@@ lu@@ ence my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view than my own extre@@ mi@@ st father is not lost on me ."
"One day , I had a conver@@ sa@@ tion with my mother about how my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view was star@@ ting to change , and she said something to me that I will h@@ old de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I live ."
"S@@ he looked at me with the we@@ ary eyes of someone who had experi@@ en@@ ced enough do@@ g@@ ma@@ tis@@ m to last a li@@ fe@@ time , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of ha@@ ting people . &quot;"
"In that in@@ st@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ ga@@ tive energy it takes to h@@ old that ha@@ tre@@ d inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
So why would I out myself and pot@@ enti@@ ally put myself in dan@@ ger ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I do it in the hop@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ el@@ led to use viol@@ ence may hear my story and real@@ ize that there is a better way , that al@@ though I had been sub@@ je@@ cted to this viol@@ ent , in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ ology , that I did not become fan@@ a@@ tic@@ ized ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , against the big@@ ot@@ ry ."
"I do it for the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism and their lo@@ ved ones , for the ter@@ ri@@ ble pa@@ in and los@@ s that ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism has for@@ ced up@@ on their lives ."
"For the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , I will spe@@ ak out against these sen@@ se@@ less ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that viol@@ ence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s reli@@ gi@@ on or ra@@ ce , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be here .
"I &apos;m hon@@ or@@ ed by the inv@@ it@@ ation , and th@@ an@@ ks ."
"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I su@@ spe@@ ct that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t inter@@ est many other people ."
"F@@ ir@@ st off , my b@@ ad@@ ge says I &apos;m an as@@ tron@@ om@@ er ."
"I would love to talk about my as@@ tron@@ omy , but I su@@ spe@@ ct that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ a@@ tive trans@@ fer in non@@ -@@ gra@@ y atmos@@ ph@@ er@@ es and pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation of light in Ju@@ p@@ it@@ er &apos;s u@@ pp@@ er atmos@@ p@@ here are the number of people who &apos;d f@@ it in a bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ter ."
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much f@@ un to talk about some stuff that happened in 19@@ 8@@ 6 and 19@@ 8@@ 7 , when a computer ha@@ ck@@ er is bre@@ ak@@ ing into our systems over at L@@ aw@@ ren@@ ce B@@ erke@@ ley L@@ ab@@ s ."
"And I ca@@ u@@ ght the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the So@@ vi@@ et K@@ G@@ B , and ste@@ al@@ ing information and sel@@ ling it ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be f@@ un — but , 20 years later ..."
"I find computer se@@ cur@@ ity , f@@ ran@@ kly , to be kind of bor@@ ing ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science ."
"The second time , it &apos;s engine@@ ering ."
"A third time , it &apos;s just being a tech@@ n@@ ici@@ an ."
"I &apos;m a scienti@@ st . On@@ ce I do something , I do something else ."
"So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that ."
"N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvi@@ ous sta@@ te@@ ments from my first book , &quot; &quot; S@@ ili@@ c@@ on S@@ n@@ ake O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , n@@ or am I going to talk about why I believe compu@@ ters don &apos;t bel@@ ong in sch@@ o@@ ols ."
I feel that there &apos;s a mas@@ sive and biz@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more compu@@ ters into sch@@ o@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"G@@ et them out of sch@@ o@@ ols , and keep them out of sch@@ o@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the ar@@ gu@@ ment is so obvi@@ ous to any@@ one who &apos;s hun@@ g around a f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de cla@@ ss@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has li@@ es in it as well .
"H@@ a@@ ving said that , I out@@ lin@@ ed my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the ma@@ in thing I wr@@ ote on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m su@@ p@@ posed to talk about the future , y@@ es ?"
"O@@ h , right . And my fe@@ eling is , as@@ king me to talk about the future is biz@@ ar@@ re , because I &apos;ve got gra@@ y ha@@ ir , and so , it &apos;s kind of sil@@ ly for me to talk about the future ."
"In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologi@@ st , a scienti@@ st , a physi@@ ci@@ st ."
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s wr@@ iting co@@ de .
"N@@ o , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten te@@ ac@@ her ."
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten te@@ ac@@ her , ask an experi@@ en@@ ced one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another gener@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I su@@ spe@@ ct , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these co@@ ol new things that are going to be there ."
"But to me , things ar@@ en &apos;t the future ."
"What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ ally good at text messa@@ ging and spend a huge amount of on@@ -@@ scre@@ en time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?"
"C@@ han@@ ge is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be f@@ un , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . R@@ ight over here .
I@@ s that vi@@ sible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is on@@ e-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ ar@@ ly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s . I not only love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"R@@ ight away , I hope that all of your eyes gla@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the audi@@ ence who know , you rol@@ l your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .
It has zer@@ o v@@ olu@@ me . And it &apos;s non@@ -@@ ori@@ en@@ table .
It has wonderful pro@@ per@@ ties .
"If you take two Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their common ed@@ ge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of gla@@ ss ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a c@@ old . ) H@@ ow@@ ever , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stan@@ ds for design ."
"@@ Ju@@ st two we@@ eks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medi@@ um and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the tra@@ de ."
"But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here ."
"This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , al@@ though in four di@@ men@@ sions it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to h@@ old any f@@ lu@@ id at all , it &apos;s per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly cap@@ able of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al di@@ men@@ sions ."
"And because our universe is only three sp@@ ati@@ al di@@ men@@ sions , it can h@@ old f@@ lu@@ i@@ ds ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the co@@ ol one .
That was a mon@@ th of my life .
"But al@@ though I would love to talk about top@@ ology with you , I &apos;m not going to ."
"( Laughter ) In@@ ste@@ ad , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mo@@ m , who pas@@ sed away last su@@ m@@ mer ."
"H@@ ad colle@@ cted photo@@ graph@@ s of me , as mo@@ thers will do ."
C@@ ould somebody put this guy up ?
"And I looked over her al@@ bu@@ m and she had colle@@ cted a picture of me , standing — well , si@@ tting — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 , in front of a bun@@ ch of di@@ als ."
"And I looked at it , and said , o@@ h my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the elec@@ tron@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o !@@ "
"As a tech@@ n@@ ici@@ an , re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing and ma@@ in@@ tain@@ ing the elec@@ tron@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o . And w@@ ow !@@ "
"W@@ ay back machine . And I said to myself , o@@ h ye@@ ah !@@ "
And it s@@ ent me back .
"S@@ o@@ on after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me ."
This guy over here of course is me .
"This man is Ro@@ ber@@ t M@@ oo@@ g , the inven@@ tor of the M@@ oo@@ g sy@@ n@@ the@@ siz@@ er , who pas@@ sed away this past Au@@ gu@@ st ."
"@@ Ro@@ ber@@ t M@@ oo@@ g was a gener@@ ous , kind person , extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily comp@@ et@@ ent engine@@ er ."
"A mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an who took time from his life to te@@ ach me , a s@@ op@@ ho@@ more , a fre@@ sh@@ man at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o ."
"He &apos;d come up from T@@ ru@@ man@@ s@@ bur@@ g to te@@ ach me not just about the M@@ oo@@ g sy@@ n@@ the@@ siz@@ er , but we &apos;d be si@@ tting there — I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying physi@@ cs at the time . This is 19@@ 6@@ 9 , 70 , 7@@ 1 ."
"We &apos;re stu@@ d@@ ying physi@@ cs , I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying physi@@ cs , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do ."
D@@ on &apos;t get ca@@ u@@ ght up in elec@@ tron@@ ic music if you &apos;re doing physi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; M@@ en@@ tor@@ ing me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
He wr@@ ote a let@@ ter of re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tion for me to get into gra@@ du@@ ate school .
"In the bac@@ k@@ ground , my bi@@ cy@@ cle ."
I real@@ ize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
B@@ o@@ b M@@ oo@@ g came by and ha@@ u@@ led a whole p@@ ile of equ@@ ip@@ ment to show Gre@@ g F@@ lin@@ t and I things about this .
"We s@@ at around talking about F@@ ou@@ ri@@ er trans@@ for@@ ms , B@@ es@@ sel fun@@ ctions , mo@@ du@@ lation trans@@ fer fun@@ ctions , stuff like this ."
B@@ o@@ b &apos;s pas@@ sing this past su@@ m@@ mer has been a los@@ s to all of us .

"( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can reco@@ gn@@ ize that there &apos;s a di@@ stor@@ ted sine wa@@ ve , almost a tri@@ an@@ gu@@ lar wa@@ ve up@@ on this He@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ P@@ ac@@ kar@@ d os@@ c@@ il@@ los@@ cop@@ e ."
"O@@ h , co@@ ol . I can get to this place over here , right ?"
K@@ i@@ ds . K@@ i@@ ds is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that o@@ kay ?
"It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about ."
"I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head ."
So I think lo@@ cally and I act lo@@ cally .
"I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very lo@@ cally ."
"So P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . this , and de@@ gre@@ e there , and the y@@ ad@@ da y@@ ad@@ da ."
I was talking about this stuff to some sch@@ o@@ ol@@ teach@@ ers about a year ago .
"And one of them , sever@@ al of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you a@@ in &apos;t teach@@ ing ? &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve ta@@ u@@ ght gra@@ du@@ ate — I &apos;ve had gra@@ du@@ ate students , I &apos;ve ta@@ u@@ ght under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate cla@@ s@@ ses . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you a@@ in &apos;t over here on the front lin@@ es ?"
P@@ ut your money where you m@@ outh is . &quot; &quot; I@@ s true . I@@ s true . I te@@ ach e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de science four days a week .
N@@ ot just sho@@ wing up every now and then .
"N@@ o , no , no , no , no . I take atten@@ dan@@ ce ."
"I take l@@ un@@ ch h@@ our . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not cl@@ ap@@ s ."
I st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly sug@@ gest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
N@@ ot just show up to cla@@ ss every now and then .
"T@@ each a so@@ li@@ d week . O@@ kay , I &apos;m teach@@ ing thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters time , but good enough ."
"One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I &apos;m going to te@@ ach you colle@@ ge@@ -@@ level physi@@ cs ."
"N@@ o cal@@ cul@@ us , I &apos;ll cut out that ."
You won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .
"But you will need to know e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra , and we &apos;re going to do ser@@ i@@ ous experim@@ ents ."
N@@ one of this open@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ch@@ ap@@ ter@@ -@@ se@@ ven@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ do@@ -@@ al@@ l-@@ the@@ -@@ od@@ d-@@ problem@@ -@@ se@@ ts .
We &apos;re going to be doing gen@@ u@@ ine physi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
"( H@@ igh@@ -@@ p@@ it@@ ched t@@ one ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three we@@ eks ago in my cla@@ ss — this is through the len@@ s , and one of the things we used a len@@ s for was to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"My students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up os@@ c@@ il@@ los@@ cop@@ e — meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ ders do you know of who have meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ?
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light here .
"I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to imp@@ ose up@@ on the po@@ w@@ ers that be , and meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !@@ "
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light !@@ "
"But me@@ an@@ while , let &apos;s meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound !@@ "
"Well , the obvi@@ ous way to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the e@@ ch@@ o ."
"But , probably — one of my students , A@@ ri@@ el &#91; un@@ cle@@ ar &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ould we meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light using the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation is the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th of any wa@@ ve ...
"@@ is a con@@ st@@ ant . Wh@@ en the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes up , the w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th goes up , fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes down . So , if we have a wa@@ ve here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the p@@ it@@ ch goes up , things get clos@@ er , p@@ it@@ ch goes down , things st@@ ret@@ ch out ."
R@@ ight ? This is simple physi@@ cs .
"A@@ ll of you know this from e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , remember ?"
"What they didn &apos;t tell you in physi@@ cs — in e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de physi@@ cs — but they should have , and I w@@ ish they had , was that if you multi@@ p@@ ly the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th of sound or light , you get a con@@ st@@ ant ."
And that con@@ st@@ ant is the spe@@ ed of sound .
"So , in order to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy . Well , that &apos;s easy ."
I &apos;ve got a fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy coun@@ ter right here .
"S@@ et it up to around A , ab@@ o@@ ve A , ab@@ o@@ ve A@@ . There &apos;s an A , more or less ."
"Now , so I know the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ."
It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z . I meas@@ ure its w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th .
"A@@ ll I need now is to fli@@ p on another be@@ am , and the bot@@ to@@ m be@@ am is me talking , right ?"
"So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the scre@@ en ."
"I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the sour@@ ce , you &apos;ll no@@ ti@@ ce the spi@@ ral ."
"The s@@ lin@@ k@@ y mo@@ ves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the wa@@ ve , coming out this way ."
"Th@@ ose of you who are physi@@ ci@@ sts , I hear you rol@@ ling your eyes , but be@@ ar with me . ( Laughter ) T@@ o meas@@ ure the w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th , all I need to do is meas@@ ure the di@@ stance from here — one full wa@@ ve — over to here ."
F@@ rom here to here is the w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th of sound .
"So , I &apos;ll put a meas@@ ur@@ ing t@@ ap@@ e here , meas@@ ur@@ ing t@@ ap@@ e here , move it back over to here ."
I &apos;ve mo@@ ved the mi@@ cro@@ phone 20 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters .
"@@ 0@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ters from here , back to here , 20 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters ."
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go back to M@@ r. E@@ l@@ m@@ o ."
"And we &apos;ll say the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy is 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 1@@ 7@@ 60 ."
The w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th was 0@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ters .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 times 0@@ .@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 5@@ 2 me@@ ters per second .
"If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 4@@ 3 ."
"But , here with k@@ lu@@ d@@ gy materi@@ al , and l@@ ous@@ y dr@@ ink — we &apos;ve been able to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound to — not bad . P@@ re@@ tty good ."
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
G@@ o back to this picture of me a million years ago .
"It was 19@@ 7@@ 1 , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying physi@@ cs : L@@ an@@ da@@ u , L@@ ip@@ sch@@ it@@ z , R@@ es@@ n@@ ic@@ k and H@@ al@@ li@@ day ."
I &apos;m going home for a mid@@ ter@@ m . A ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on ca@@ mp@@ us .
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot ! H@@ ey , E@@ l@@ m@@ o &apos;s done : off ."
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on ca@@ mp@@ us , and the poli@@ ce are ch@@ as@@ ing me , right ?"
"I &apos;m wal@@ king across ca@@ mp@@ us . Co@@ p comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a stu@@ dent . &quot;"
P@@ ul@@ ls out a g@@ un . G@@ o@@ es bo@@ om !
And a te@@ ar g@@ as can@@ ister the size of a P@@ ep@@ si can goes by my head . Wh@@ o@@ os@@ h !
I get a bre@@ ath of te@@ ar g@@ as and I can &apos;t bre@@ a@@ the .
This co@@ p comes after me with a ri@@ f@@ le .
He wan@@ ts to cl@@ un@@ k me over the head !
"I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to cle@@ ar out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go run@@ ning across ca@@ mp@@ us quic@@ k as I can . I du@@ ck into Hay@@ es H@@ all ."
It &apos;s one of these bel@@ l-@@ to@@ wer buil@@ din@@ gs .
The co@@ p &apos;s ch@@ as@@ ing me .
"C@@ has@@ ing me up the first flo@@ or , second flo@@ or , third flo@@ or ."
C@@ has@@ es me into this room .
The en@@ tran@@ ce@@ way to the be@@ ll to@@ wer .
"I sla@@ m the do@@ or behind me , cli@@ m@@ b up , go past this place where I see a pen@@ du@@ lu@@ m tic@@ king ."
"And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , the squ@@ are ro@@ ot of the len@@ g@@ th is pro@@ por@@ tional to its peri@@ od . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep cli@@ mb@@ ing up , go back ."
I go to a place where a do@@ w@@ el sp@@ li@@ ts off .
"There &apos;s a c@@ lo@@ ck , c@@ lo@@ ck , c@@ lo@@ ck , c@@ lo@@ ck ."
The time &apos;s going bac@@ k@@ wards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of L@@ or@@ en@@ z con@@ tra@@ ctions and E@@ inste@@ in@@ ian rela@@ tivity .
"I cli@@ m@@ b up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you cli@@ m@@ b up this w@@ oo@@ den la@@ d@@ der ."
"I po@@ p up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a ."
"A do@@ me , one of these ten@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t do@@ mes ."
"I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cop@@ s bas@@ h@@ ing students &apos; he@@ ads , sho@@ ot@@ ing te@@ ar g@@ as , and wat@@ ching students th@@ ro@@ wing bri@@ cks ."
"And I &apos;m as@@ king , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I remember what my En@@ gli@@ sh te@@ ac@@ her in high school said ."
"N@@ a@@ me@@ ly , that when they c@@ ast bel@@ ls , they wr@@ ite in@@ s@@ cri@@ p@@ tions on them ."
"So , I wi@@ pe the pi@@ ge@@ on man@@ ure off one of the bel@@ ls , and I look at it ."
"I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words in@@ s@@ cri@@ bed up@@ on the Hay@@ es H@@ all to@@ wer bel@@ ls : &quot; &quot; All tru@@ th is one ."
"In this light , may science and reli@@ gi@@ on en@@ de@@ av@@ or here for the ste@@ ad@@ y ev@@ olution of man@@ kind , from d@@ ark@@ ness to light , from n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ ness to bro@@ ad@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , from pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance ."
"It is the vo@@ ice of life , which cal@@ ls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much ."
"A few years ago , I bro@@ ke into my own house ."
"I had just dri@@ ven home , it was around mid@@ night in the de@@ ad of M@@ on@@ tre@@ al win@@ ter , I had been vi@@ si@@ ting my friend , J@@ ef@@ f , across to@@ wn , and the ther@@ mo@@ me@@ ter on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 de@@ gre@@ es — and don &apos;t bo@@ ther as@@ king if that &apos;s C@@ el@@ si@@ us or F@@ ah@@ ren@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two scal@@ es me@@ et — it was very c@@ old ."
"And as I sto@@ od on the front por@@ ch f@@ um@@ b@@ ling in my po@@ c@@ ket@@ s , I found I didn &apos;t have my ke@@ ys ."
"In fact , I could see them through the win@@ do@@ w , lying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them ."
"So I quickly ran around and tried all the other do@@ ors and win@@ do@@ ws , and they were lo@@ c@@ ked ti@@ ght ."
"I thought about cal@@ ling a lo@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith — at least I had my cel@@ l@@ phone , but at mid@@ night , it could take a while for a lo@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith to show up , and it was c@@ old ."
"I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend J@@ ef@@ f &apos;s house for the night because I had an early f@@ light to Euro@@ pe the next mor@@ ning , and I needed to get my pas@@ sp@@ ort and my su@@ it@@ case ."
"So , des@@ per@@ ate and fre@@ ez@@ ing c@@ old , I found a large ro@@ ck and I bro@@ ke through the bas@@ e@@ ment win@@ do@@ w , c@@ lear@@ ed out the sh@@ ar@@ ds of gla@@ ss , I cra@@ w@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard and t@@ ap@@ ed it up over the open@@ ing , fig@@ ur@@ ing that in the mor@@ ning , on the way to the air@@ p@@ ort , I could call my con@@ tra@@ ctor and ask him to fi@@ x it ."
"This was going to be ex@@ pen@@ sive , but probably no more ex@@ pen@@ sive than a mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night lo@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith , so I fi@@ gu@@ red , under the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , I was coming out even ."
"Now , I &apos;m a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st by tra@@ ining and I know a little bit about how the brain perfor@@ ms under stre@@ ss ."
"It re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l that ra@@ i@@ ses your heart rate , it mo@@ du@@ la@@ tes ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine lev@@ els and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking ."
"So the next mor@@ ning , when I w@@ ok@@ e up on too little s@@ le@@ ep , wor@@ r@@ ying about the h@@ ole in the win@@ do@@ w , and a mental n@@ ote that I had to call my con@@ tra@@ ctor , and the fre@@ ez@@ ing temp@@ er@@ atu@@ res , and the me@@ et@@ ings I had up@@ coming in Euro@@ pe , and , you know , with all the cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l in my brain , my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cl@@ ou@@ dy because my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy ."
"( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the air@@ p@@ ort che@@ ck@@ -@@ in coun@@ ter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pas@@ sp@@ ort . ( Laughter )"
"So I ra@@ ced home in the s@@ now and ice , 40 minutes , got my pas@@ sp@@ ort , ra@@ ced back to the air@@ p@@ ort , I made it just in time , but they had given away my se@@ at to someone else , so I got stu@@ ck in the back of the plan@@ e , next to the ba@@ th@@ ro@@ o@@ ms , in a se@@ at that w@@ ouldn &apos;t re@@ cl@@ ine , on an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our f@@ light ."
"Well , I had a lot of time to think during those e@@ ight hours and no s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Laughter ) And I started wonder@@ ing , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will pre@@ v@@ ent bad things from happening ?"
"So I started thinking about that , but my thou@@ ghts didn &apos;t c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al@@ li@@ ze until about a mon@@ th later ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had g@@ ot@@ ten from the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ st G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had wr@@ it@@ ten about it a few years before , also called the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m ."
"Now , you all know what the pos@@ t@@ mor@@ te@@ m is ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever there &apos;s a dis@@ as@@ ter , a team of exper@@ ts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?"
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
"S@@ ome of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ r@@ ound the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a place for things that are eas@@ ily lost ."
The hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us is the part of the brain that in L@@ on@@ don ta@@ x@@ i@@ ca@@ b dri@@ ver@@ s be@@ comes en@@ lar@@ ged .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allo@@ ws squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their n@@ u@@ ts .
"And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , somebody actually did the experim@@ ent where they cut off the ol@@ fac@@ tor@@ y sense of the squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls , and they could still find their n@@ u@@ ts ."
"They wer@@ en &apos;t using s@@ me@@ ll , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us , this ex@@ qui@@ si@@ tely ev@@ olved me@@ chan@@ ism in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around ."
So this is why we l@@ ose car ke@@ ys and read@@ ing gla@@ s@@ ses and pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"So in the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a s@@ po@@ t for your ke@@ ys — a ho@@ ok by the do@@ or , maybe a de@@ cor@@ a@@ tive bo@@ w@@ l ."
"For your pas@@ sp@@ ort , a particular dra@@ wer ."
"For your read@@ ing gla@@ s@@ ses , a particular table ."
"If you desig@@ n@@ ate a s@@ po@@ t and you &apos;re s@@ c@@ rup@@ ul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about tra@@ vel ?
"If these things are lost or st@@ ol@@ en , you can fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ate re@@ pla@@ ce@@ ment ."
Now these are some rather obvi@@ ous things .
"@@ Re@@ me@@ mber , when you &apos;re under stre@@ ss , the brain re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l ."
"C@@ or@@ ti@@ so@@ l is to@@ x@@ ic , and it ca@@ uses cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
And there &apos;s perhaps no more st@@ res@@ s@@ ful a si@@ tu@@ ation than when you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a medi@@ cal deci@@ sion to make .
"And at some point , all of us are going to be in that posi@@ tion , where we have to make a very important deci@@ sion about the future of our medi@@ cal care or that of a lo@@ ved one , to help them with a deci@@ sion ."
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medi@@ cal con@@ di@@ tion .
"But this stan@@ ds as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medi@@ cal deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making , and inde@@ ed for finan@@ cial deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making , and social deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making — any kind of deci@@ sion you have to make that would ben@@ ef@@ it from a ra@@ tional as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment of the fac@@ ts ."
"So supp@@ ose you go to your do@@ ctor and the do@@ ctor says , &quot; I just got your la@@ b work back , your ch@@ ol@@ e@@ ster@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;"
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a dru@@ g or under@@ go a sur@@ ger@@ y or any medi@@ cal pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re before one person is help@@ ed .
"And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of cra@@ z@@ y sta@@ ti@@ stic is that ?"
The number should be one .
My do@@ ctor w@@ ouldn &apos;t pres@@ cri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
"But actually , medi@@ cal pra@@ cti@@ ce doesn &apos;t work that way ."
"And it &apos;s not the do@@ ctor &apos;s fa@@ ult , if it &apos;s any@@ body &apos;s fa@@ ult , it &apos;s the fa@@ ult of scienti@@ sts like me ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red out the under@@ lying me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line es@@ ti@@ ma@@ tes that 9@@ 0 percent of the dru@@ gs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
"So the number needed to tre@@ at for the most w@@ ide@@ ly pres@@ cri@@ bed sta@@ tin , what do you supp@@ ose it is ?"
How many people have to take it before one person is help@@ ed ?
3@@ 00 .
"Wh@@ y not , do@@ c ? G@@ ive me the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion any@@ way . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another sta@@ ti@@ stic , and that is , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about the side effe@@ cts . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"So for this particular dru@@ g , the side effe@@ cts oc@@ cu@@ r in five percent of the pati@@ ents ."
"Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the sta@@ tin or not ."
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conver@@ sa@@ tion with your do@@ ctor .
You have the right to have ac@@ cess to this kind of information to be@@ gin the conver@@ sa@@ tion about whether you want to take the ris@@ ks or not .
"For the most w@@ ide@@ ly perfor@@ med sur@@ ger@@ y on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate for cancer , the number needed to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ ger@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s help@@ ed ."
And the side effe@@ cts in that case oc@@ cu@@ r in 50 percent of the pati@@ ents .
"They inclu@@ de imp@@ ot@@ ence , er@@ e@@ cti@@ le dy@@ s@@ fun@@ ction , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , re@@ c@@ tal te@@ aring , fe@@ cal in@@ contin@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the s@@ po@@ t .
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
"These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your lo@@ ved ones ."
"You might change your mind in the he@@ at of the moment , but at least you &apos;re pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed with this kind of thinking ."
"@@ Re@@ me@@ mber , our brain under stre@@ ss re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bun@@ ch on systems sh@@ ut down ."
There &apos;s an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary reason for this .
"F@@ ac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ face with a pre@@ da@@ tor , you don &apos;t need your di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , because if you &apos;re body is ex@@ pen@@ ding met@@ ab@@ oli@@ s@@ m on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s l@@ un@@ ch , and then n@@ one of those things matter ."
So we need to tra@@ in ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of si@@ tu@@ ations .
I think the important point here is reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ ing that all of us are fla@@ wed .
We all are going to fa@@ il now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fa@@ il@@ u@@ res might be , to put systems in place that will help min@@ i@@ mize the da@@ ma@@ ge , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the bad things from happening in the first place ."
"G@@ et@@ ting back to that s@@ no@@ w@@ y night in M@@ on@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my tri@@ p , I had my con@@ tra@@ ctor in@@ st@@ all a com@@ bin@@ ation lo@@ ck next to the do@@ or , with a key to the front do@@ or in it , an easy to remember com@@ bin@@ ation ."
"And I have to ad@@ mit , I still have pi@@ les of ma@@ il that ha@@ ven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and pi@@ les of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s that I ha@@ ven &apos;t gone through ."
"So I &apos;m not completely organiz@@ ed , but I see organiz@@ ation as a gra@@ du@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there ."
Thank you very much .

G@@ o@@ od mor@@ ning !
A@@ re you aw@@ ake ?
"They took my name ta@@ g , but I wanted to ask you , did any@@ one here wr@@ ite their name on the ta@@ g in Ara@@ bi@@ c ?"
"An@@ y@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem ."
"On@@ ce up@@ on a time , not long ago , I was si@@ tting in a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant with my friend , or@@ der@@ ing food ."
"So I looked at the wa@@ it@@ er and said , &quot; D@@ o you have a men@@ u ( Ara@@ bi@@ c ) ? &quot;"
"He looked at me st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ e@@ ard ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry ? ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The men@@ u ( Ara@@ bi@@ c ) , ple@@ ase . &quot; &quot; He re@@ p@@ li@@ ed , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) , or &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( F@@ ren@@ ch ) . &quot; &quot; I@@ s the F@@ ren@@ ch pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation cor@@ re@@ ct ?"
"&quot; &quot; C@@ ome , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ it@@ er ."
"He was dis@@ gu@@ s@@ ted when talking to me , as if he was saying to hi@@ m@@ self , &quot; If this was the last gir@@ l on Earth , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;"
What &apos;s the me@@ an@@ ing of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in Ara@@ bi@@ c ?
T@@ w@@ o words made a Le@@ ban@@ ese young man ju@@ dge a gir@@ l as being bac@@ k@@ ward and ig@@ nor@@ ant .
How could she spe@@ ak that way ?
"A@@ t that moment , I started thinking ."
It made me ma@@ d .
It defin@@ i@@ tely h@@ ur@@ ts !
I &apos;m den@@ i@@ ed the right to spe@@ ak my own language in my own country ?
Wh@@ ere could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
"Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would re@@ ach a st@@ age in their lives , where they inv@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed ."
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get all my culture , thou@@ ghts , in@@ tel@@ le@@ ct and all my me@@ mor@@ ies ?"
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ ho@@ od stories might be the best me@@ mor@@ ies we have of the war !
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get everything I learned in Ara@@ bi@@ c , just to con@@ form ?"
T@@ o be one of them ?
Wh@@ ere &apos;s the lo@@ gi@@ c in that ?
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite all that , I tried to understand him ."
I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ dge him with the same cru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ ged me .
The Ara@@ bi@@ c language doesn &apos;t sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y today &apos;s needs .
"It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in uni@@ versi@@ ties , a language we use in the work@@ place , a language we re@@ ly on if we were to per@@ form an ad@@ van@@ ced research project , and it defin@@ i@@ tely isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ p@@ ort ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our c@@ lo@@ the@@ s ."
"Wh@@ ere can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !@@ "
"So , you want us to use Ara@@ bi@@ c . Wh@@ ere are we to do so ?"
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ou@@ ght to think about .
Ara@@ bi@@ c is the mother ton@@ gue .
Re@@ search says that ma@@ ster@@ y of other langu@@ a@@ ges de@@ man@@ ds ma@@ ster@@ y of the mother ton@@ gue .
M@@ as@@ ter@@ y of the mother ton@@ gue is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ i@@ site for crea@@ tive ex@@ pres@@ sion in other langu@@ a@@ ges .
How ?
"G@@ i@@ br@@ an K@@ hal@@ il G@@ i@@ br@@ an , when he first started wr@@ iting , he used Ara@@ bi@@ c ."
"A@@ ll his ideas , ima@@ gin@@ ation and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y were in@@ spi@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the vil@@ la@@ ge where he gre@@ w up , s@@ me@@ l@@ ling a speci@@ fic s@@ me@@ ll , he@@ aring a speci@@ fic vo@@ ice , and thinking a speci@@ fic thought ."
"So , when he started wr@@ iting in En@@ gli@@ sh , he had enough ba@@ g@@ ga@@ ge ."
"E@@ ven when he wr@@ ote in En@@ gli@@ sh , when you read his wr@@ it@@ ings in En@@ gli@@ sh , you s@@ me@@ ll the same s@@ me@@ ll , sense the same fe@@ eling ."
"You can imagine that that &apos;s him wr@@ iting in En@@ gli@@ sh , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ tain . F@@ rom a vil@@ la@@ ge on M@@ oun@@ t Le@@ ban@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can ar@@ gue with ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , it &apos;s often said that if you want to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , the only way to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , is to k@@ ill its language ."
This is a reality that develop@@ ed soci@@ e@@ ties are aw@@ are of .
"The Ger@@ man@@ s , F@@ ren@@ ch , Jap@@ an@@ ese and Ch@@ in@@ ese , all these na@@ tions are aw@@ are of this ."
That &apos;s why they le@@ gi@@ s@@ late to prote@@ ct their language .
They make it sa@@ cre@@ d .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produ@@ ction , they pay a lot of money to devel@@ op it ."
D@@ o we know better than them ?
"A@@ ll right , we ar@@ en &apos;t from the develop@@ ed world , this ad@@ van@@ ced thinking has@@ n &apos;t re@@ ach@@ ed us yet , and we would like to cat@@ ch up with the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for develop@@ ment , do research , and cat@@ ch up with those countries , such as T@@ ur@@ key , M@@ al@@ ay@@ si@@ a and others , they car@@ ri@@ ed their language with them as they were cli@@ mb@@ ing the la@@ d@@ der , prote@@ cted it like a dia@@ mon@@ d ."
They ke@@ pt it close to them .
"Because if you get any produ@@ ct from T@@ ur@@ key or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not la@@ be@@ led in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local produ@@ ct ."
You w@@ ouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local produ@@ ct .
"They &apos;d go back to being consu@@ mers , clu@@ ele@@ ss consu@@ mers , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in order for them to inno@@ v@@ ate and produ@@ ce , they had to prote@@ ct their language ."
"If I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ vere@@ i@@ gn@@ ty , inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce ( Ara@@ bi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; what does this re@@ mind you of ?"
"It doesn &apos;t r@@ ing a be@@ ll , does it ?"
"@@ Re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t just for conver@@ sing , just words coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age re@@ presen@@ ts speci@@ fic sta@@ ges in our lives , and ter@@ min@@ ology that is lin@@ ked to our emo@@ tions ."
"So when we say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ vere@@ i@@ gn@@ ty , inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a speci@@ fic image in their own mind , there are speci@@ fic fe@@ el@@ ings of a speci@@ fic day in a speci@@ fic hi@@ stor@@ i@@ cal peri@@ od ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or let@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea inside that rela@@ tes to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us ."
What is our in@@ tel@@ le@@ ct ?
How do you say whether this guy under@@ stan@@ ds or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ vere@@ i@@ gn@@ ty , inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the peri@@ od of the fre@@ e@@ dom ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) s@@ lo@@ gan ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in va@@ in ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a f@@ ran@@ cop@@ h@@ one friend who &apos;s mar@@ ri@@ ed to a F@@ ren@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing is f@@ ine , but once , I sp@@ ent a whole night as@@ king and trying to trans@@ late the me@@ an@@ ing of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or woman had mi@@ st@@ ak@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i , &quot; &quot; and then sp@@ ent the whole night trying to expla@@ in it to him ."
He was p@@ uz@@ z@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could any@@ one be this cru@@ el ?
Do@@ es she want to com@@ mit su@@ ici@@ de ?
&apos;@@ B@@ ur@@ y me ? &apos; ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few exa@@ mp@@ les .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s un@@ able to tell that word to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
"S@@ he said to me , &quot; &quot; He list@@ en@@ s to F@@ air@@ uz with me , and one night , I tried to trans@@ late for him so he can feel what I feel when I list@@ en to F@@ air@@ uz . &quot; &quot; The po@@ or woman tried to trans@@ late this for him : &quot; F@@ rom them I ex@@ ten@@ ded my hands and st@@ ole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you bel@@ ong to them , I re@@ turned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )"
T@@ ran@@ s@@ late that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prote@@ ct the Ara@@ bi@@ c language ?"
"We turned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the ci@@ vi@@ l society , and we la@@ un@@ ched a ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve the Ara@@ bi@@ c language ."
"E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?"
F@@ or@@ get about this he@@ ada@@ ch@@ e and go have f@@ un . &quot; &quot; No problem !
"The ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve Ara@@ bi@@ c la@@ un@@ ched a s@@ lo@@ gan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ p@@ ly from the W@@ est . &quot;"
"We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not ac@@ cept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t ad@@ op@@ t this st@@ yle because that way , we w@@ ouldn &apos;t be under@@ sto@@ od ."
"And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I ha@@ te the Ara@@ bi@@ c language ."
"We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced in a way that re@@ fle@@ cts our dre@@ a@@ ms , as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions and day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day life ."
In a way that d@@ res@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
"So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ p@@ ly from the W@@ est &quot; &quot; has h@@ it the s@@ po@@ t ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very easy , yet crea@@ tive and per@@ su@@ as@@ ive ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we la@@ un@@ ched another ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n with s@@ cen@@ es of let@@ ters on the ground ."
"You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a s@@ cen@@ e of a let@@ ter sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by black and y@@ el@@ low t@@ ap@@ e with &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t k@@ ill your language ! &quot; &quot; wr@@ it@@ ten on it ."
"Wh@@ y ? S@@ er@@ i@@ ously , don &apos;t k@@ ill your language ."
We really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t k@@ ill our language .
"If we were to k@@ ill the language , we &apos;d have to find an iden@@ ti@@ ty ."
We &apos;d have to find an ex@@ ist@@ ence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is be@@ yon@@ d just mi@@ ss@@ ing our chan@@ ce of being modern and ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed .
Af@@ ter that we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed photo@@ s of guys and gir@@ ls we@@ aring the Ara@@ bi@@ c let@@ ter .
P@@ h@@ oto@@ s of &quot; &quot; co@@ ol &quot; &quot; guys and gir@@ ls .
We are very co@@ ol !
"And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an En@@ gli@@ sh word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I ad@@ op@@ t the word &apos; co@@ ol . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them obje@@ ct ho@@ w@@ ever they want , but give me a word that &apos;s n@@ ic@@ er and mat@@ ches the reality better ."
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wi@@ de we@@ b &quot; &quot; ( Lau@@ gh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t f@@ it ! We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t k@@ id ourselves .
"But to re@@ ach this point , we all have to be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t al@@ low any@@ one who is big@@ ger or thin@@ ks they have any au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want ."
C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity is the idea .
"So , if we can &apos;t re@@ ach space or build a ro@@ c@@ ket and so on , we can be crea@@ tive ."
"A@@ t this moment , every one of you is a crea@@ tive project ."
C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity in your mother ton@@ gue is the pat@@ h .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s wr@@ ite a no@@ vel or produ@@ ce a sh@@ ort film .
A single no@@ vel could make us global again .
It could bring the Ara@@ bi@@ c language back to being number one .
"So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solu@@ tion ; there is a solu@@ tion !@@ "
"But we have to know that , and be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that a solu@@ tion ex@@ ists , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solu@@ tion ."
"In con@@ clu@@ sion , what can you do today ?"
"Now , twe@@ ets , who &apos;s twe@@ et@@ ing ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has fin@@ ish@@ ed , e@@ ither Ara@@ bi@@ c , En@@ gli@@ sh , F@@ ren@@ ch or Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
But don &apos;t wr@@ ite Ara@@ bi@@ c with La@@ tin charac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with num@@ bers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a dis@@ as@@ ter ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a vir@@ tual world with a vir@@ tual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and ri@@ se .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
"S@@ econ@@ d , there are many other things that we can do ."
We &apos;re not here today to con@@ v@@ ince each other .
We &apos;re here to bring atten@@ tion to the ne@@ ce@@ s@@ si@@ ty of pre@@ ser@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a se@@ cre@@ t .
A bab@@ y first iden@@ ti@@ fi@@ es its father through language .
"When my da@@ u@@ ghter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , hon@@ ey ( Ara@@ bi@@ c ) . &quot; &quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your da@@ d , hon@@ ey ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) . &quot; &quot; And in the su@@ per@@ market , I pro@@ mi@@ se my da@@ u@@ ghter No@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ ks ( Ara@@ bi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ ci , Ma@@ man , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her ."
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get ri@@ d of this cul@@ tu@@ ral c@@ r@@ in@@ ge . ( Applause )
"S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ ability re@@ presen@@ ts the what , the where and the how of what is ca@@ u@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they re@@ ly on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
U@@ n@@ der@@ standing all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of se@@ af@@ o@@ od away from a com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty to an opport@@ unity to re@@ stor@@ e our ec@@ osy@@ ste@@ m .
It allo@@ ws for us to ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te the se@@ af@@ o@@ od that we &apos;re also so for@@ tun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
"Wh@@ ere su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to en@@ du@@ re and ma@@ in@@ tain , re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive is the ability to re@@ p@@ len@@ ish and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"@@ Re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od allo@@ ws for an ev@@ ol@@ ving and dy@@ na@@ mic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the ocean as a resour@@ ce , sug@@ ge@@ sting that we en@@ ga@@ ge to re@@ p@@ len@@ ish the ocean and to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge its resi@@ li@@ en@@ cy ."
"It is a more hop@@ e@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more u@@ se@@ ful way of under@@ standing our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ ide@@ s — stan@@ d@@ ard issu@@ e by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation world — are very han@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonderful to@@ ol .
"G@@ re@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ af@@ o@@ od species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : bu@@ y gre@@ en , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think tw@@ ice about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at gre@@ en li@@ st ."
We can &apos;t su@@ sta@@ in this without the meas@@ ure of our suc@@ cess really chan@@ ging the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the gre@@ en li@@ st ?
You &apos;ve got pol@@ e-@@ ca@@ u@@ ght y@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in t@@ una here — comes from su@@ sta@@ in@@ able sto@@ cks .
P@@ ole ca@@ u@@ ght — no b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for f@@ is@@ her@@ men . L@@ ots of money . Su@@ pp@@ ort@@ ing local economi@@ es .
But it &apos;s a lion of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ da@@ tor .
What &apos;s the con@@ text of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I si@@ tting down in a ste@@ ak@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
D@@ o I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the gre@@ en li@@ st , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oce@@ ans any fav@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a con@@ text , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ a@@ mple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ an@@ ts and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to dr@@ ink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prote@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it re@@ gar@@ ds our food , and we are pay@@ ing a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost ben@@ e@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce of exp@@ an@@ ding wa@@ ist@@ lin@@ es .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster prof@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"@@ Re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od might best be re@@ presen@@ ted not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ pp@@ er , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s f@@ is@@ her@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ tab@@ les : they might yet sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a lik@@ es to say that b@@ lue is the new gre@@ en .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ ful@@ ly sub@@ mit that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i gre@@ en might then be the new b@@ lue .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ af@@ o@@ od possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and lem@@ on we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia bre@@ a@@ ded with Di@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ i@@ led b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing p@@ ile of pe@@ can qu@@ in@@ o@@ a pi@@ la@@ f with c@@ run@@ ch@@ y , gr@@ il@@ led bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and s@@ mo@@ k@@ y on the outside with just a h@@ int of ch@@ ili fla@@ ke ."
Wh@@ oo@@ o !
This is an easy se@@ ll .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble to every family at the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ a@@ mi@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a patter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar h@@ olo@@ ca@@ u@@ st ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ va@@ ged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expe@@ ct from our food .
Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is compli@@ cated but din@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of mo@@ vement re@@ cen@@ tly in gre@@ en@@ ing our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are le@@ ad@@ ing pas@@ sion@@ ately the gre@@ en food D@@ eli@@ ci@@ ous R@@ ev@@ olution .
But gre@@ en f@@ oo@@ ds often re@@ present a way for us to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ at@@ ers .
Ju@@ st because it comes from a gre@@ en sour@@ ce doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard on the pla@@ te .
We have e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly sh@@ ri@@ mp .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly al@@ l-@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ mp bu@@ f@@ fe@@ t .
It doesn &apos;t work .
He@@ art@@ -@@ heal@@ thy din@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
"Wh@@ ile we try to man@@ age de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing mar@@ ine popu@@ la@@ tions , the media &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ding incre@@ as@@ ed consu@@ mp@@ tion of se@@ af@@ o@@ od ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American gran@@ d@@ mo@@ thers , gran@@ d@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ o@@ od ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not wil@@ ling to pas@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pla@@ tes .
"As a che@@ f , I real@@ ize the eas@@ i@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ du@@ ce the por@@ tion siz@@ es on my pla@@ te ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ eople started bu@@ ying appe@@ ti@@ z@@ ers and sal@@ ads , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the en@@ tre@@ es al@@ one ."
"P@@ eople sp@@ ent more time en@@ ga@@ ging in their me@@ als , en@@ ga@@ ging with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ eople got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even though they got less prote@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ or@@ ies over the course of a di@@ versi@@ fied me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ viron@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pla@@ te , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was be@@ gin to di@@ versi@@ f@@ y the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , ma@@ ck@@ er@@ el , sar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common ."
"S@@ hel@@ l@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , oy@@ ster@@ s , cla@@ ms , ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia , cha@@ r — these were the common species ."
"We were dire@@ cting tas@@ tes to@@ wards more resi@@ li@@ ence , more re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fav@@ or .
This is what the gre@@ en li@@ st says .
But this is also how we can actually be@@ gin to re@@ stor@@ e our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ da@@ tors , those fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able species , that gre@@ en li@@ st t@@ una that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ pe for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
S@@ tar@@ t with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pla@@ tes .
"M@@ ound up those four pla@@ tes with ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ un@@ dy you have , light the can@@ d@@ les and ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te it ."
C@@ ele@@ bra@@ te the opport@@ unity you have to e@@ at this .
"I@@ n@@ v@@ ite your friends and neigh@@ bor@@ s over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I expe@@ ct a lot from food .
I expe@@ ct health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I expe@@ ct that produ@@ cing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the communi@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was lu@@ ck@@ y enough that my father was a fan@@ tas@@ tic co@@ ok .
And he ta@@ u@@ ght me very early on about the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ presen@@ ts .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prote@@ in ser@@ ved with cop@@ i@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ties of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , u@@ su@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get si@@ ck when I go to ste@@ ak@@ h@@ ou@@ ses .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ at@@ s .
It &apos;s like a han@@ go@@ ver from prote@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you possi@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ e@@ some in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ t@@ ter and sal@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things tas@@ te less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ cip@@ es that gen@@ u@@ fle@@ ct to my own person@@ al hi@@ stories ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first step to min@@ i@@ mize it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our b@@ lue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our resour@@ ces ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ o@@ graph@@ y of the communi@@ on we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can be@@ gin to share the rest , we can be@@ gin to ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te , we can be@@ gin to re@@ stor@@ e ."
We need to sav@@ or ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
We need to sav@@ or s@@ mal@@ ler por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
And we need to sa@@ ve din@@ ner .
Thank you .

H@@ i . I am an archi@@ te@@ ct .
"I am the only archi@@ te@@ ct in the world making buil@@ din@@ gs out of p@@ aper like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is the first one I did using p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about ec@@ ological issu@@ es and environ@@ mental issu@@ es , I just started te@@ sting the p@@ aper tu@@ be in order to use this as a building stru@@ cture ."
"It &apos;s very compli@@ cated to test the new materi@@ al for the building , but this is much st@@ ron@@ ger than I expe@@ cted , and also it &apos;s very easy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indu@@ stri@@ al materi@@ al , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the temp@@ or@@ ary stru@@ cture , 199@@ 0 ."
This is the first temp@@ or@@ ary building made out of p@@ aper .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ be@@ s , dia@@ me@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ be@@ s with a dia@@ me@@ ter of 1@@ 20 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters , or four feet , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the ph@@ ot@@ o , inside is the to@@ ile@@ t ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ ish@@ ed with to@@ ile@@ t p@@ aper , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very u@@ se@@ ful ."
"Y@@ e@@ ar 2@@ 000 , there was a big exp@@ o in Ger@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the exp@@ o was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was ch@@ os@@ en to build the pa@@ vi@@ lion out of p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s , re@@ cy@@ cla@@ ble p@@ aper ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"My go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ lions but after half a year , we create a lot of indu@@ stri@@ al was@@ te , so my building has to be re@@ used or re@@ cy@@ c@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was re@@ cy@@ c@@ led ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to w@@ in the com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion to build the second P@@ o@@ mp@@ i@@ do@@ u C@@ en@@ ter in Fran@@ ce in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to r@@ ent an of@@ fi@@ ce in Par@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d it , so I decided to bring my students to Par@@ is to build our of@@ fi@@ ce on top of the P@@ o@@ mp@@ i@@ do@@ u C@@ en@@ ter in Par@@ is by ourselves ."
So we b@@ rought the p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s and the w@@ oo@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long of@@ fi@@ ce .
We st@@ ay@@ ed there for six years without pay@@ ing any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a tic@@ ket to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ o@@ mp@@ i@@ do@@ u C@@ en@@ ter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very popu@@ lar mu@@ se@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ um@@ ent for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted at my profes@@ sion as an archi@@ te@@ ct , because we are not help@@ ing , we are not working for society , but we are working for pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged people , ri@@ ch people , government , develop@@ ers ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ vi@@ sible .
So they hi@@ re us to vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize their power and money by making mon@@ u@@ mental archi@@ te@@ cture .
"That is our profes@@ sion , even hi@@ stor@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their h@@ ou@@ ses by natural dis@@ as@@ ters ."
But I must say they are no longer natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es never k@@ ill people , but col@@ l@@ ap@@ se of the buil@@ din@@ gs k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of archi@@ te@@ cts .
"Th@@ en people need some temp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no archi@@ te@@ cts working there because we are too bu@@ s@@ y working for pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged people ."
"So I thought , even as archi@@ te@@ cts , we can be inv@@ olved in the re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction of temp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in dis@@ as@@ ter are@@ as .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big dis@@ as@@ ter in R@@ wan@@ da , Africa ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ be@@ s , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ ut@@ si , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so surpri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ mp organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are fre@@ ez@@ ing with b@@ lan@@ ket@@ s during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a pla@@ stic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to cut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people cut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ for@@ est@@ ation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um bar@@ ra@@ cks ."
"@@ V@@ er@@ y ex@@ pen@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then cu@@ tting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ posed my idea to im@@ pro@@ ve the si@@ tu@@ ation using these re@@ cy@@ c@@ led p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s because this is so che@@ ap and also so str@@ ong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.@@ S@@ . dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the du@@ ra@@ bility and mo@@ ist@@ ure and ter@@ mi@@ tes , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , Jap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kil@@ led , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a di@@ stri@@ ct , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fir@@ e after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ me@@ se re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ ff@@ ering and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ th@@ oli@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was tot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you cra@@ z@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fir@@ e , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ s@@ ted me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started com@@ mu@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I met the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ me@@ se people ."
They were living like this with very po@@ or pla@@ stic sh@@ e@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I ra@@ i@@ sed — did fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a p@@ aper tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ li@@ sh , I used be@@ er cra@@ tes as a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ p@@ ose , because at that time , the A@@ sah@@ i be@@ er company made their pla@@ stic be@@ er cra@@ tes red , which doesn &apos;t go with the col@@ or of the p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s ."
The col@@ or co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were expe@@ cting to have a be@@ er inside the pla@@ stic be@@ er cra@@ te , but it came emp@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the su@@ m@@ mer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ s@@ ted me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you colle@@ ct money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we sp@@ ent five we@@ eks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it st@@ ay@@ ed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ posed to don@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we s@@ ent them over to be built by v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It st@@ ay@@ ed there in T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a temp@@ or@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in p@@ aper can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very temp@@ or@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local materi@@ al to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka , after the Su@@ ma@@ tr@@ a ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ sun@@ a@@ mi , I re@@ built I@@ sla@@ mic f@@ is@@ her@@ men &apos;s vil@@ la@@ ges ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ en@@ g@@ du , S@@ i@@ ch@@ u@@ an area in China , ne@@ ar@@ ly 7@@ 0,000 people were kil@@ led , and also es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally many of the sch@@ o@@ ols were de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed because of the cor@@ rup@@ tion between the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and the con@@ tra@@ ctor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the temp@@ or@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I b@@ rought my Jap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Ch@@ in@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted n@@ ine cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ o@@ ms , over 500 squ@@ are me@@ ters ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the cur@@ r@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting ph@@ ot@@ o : for@@ mer P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister B@@ er@@ lu@@ s@@ con@@ i and Jap@@ an@@ ese for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister M@@ r. A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ ister ever year ."
"And they are very kind , af@@ for@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a temp@@ or@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very fa@@ mous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t hal@@ ls were de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , so mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ posed to the ma@@ yor , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the temp@@ or@@ ary audi@@ tor@@ i@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lu@@ ck@@ y ."
"M@@ r. B@@ er@@ lu@@ s@@ con@@ i b@@ rought G@@ 8 su@@ m@@ mit , and our for@@ mer pri@@ me min@@ ister came , so they help@@ ed us to colle@@ ct money , and I got half a million e@@ uro@@ s from the Jap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this temp@@ or@@ ary audi@@ tor@@ i@@ um ."
"Y@@ e@@ ar 20@@ 10 in Ha@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s im@@ possible to f@@ ly over , so I went to San@@ to Do@@ min@@ go , ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to Ha@@ it@@ i with the local students in San@@ to Do@@ min@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s ."
"This is what happened in Jap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n Jap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ sun@@ a@@ mi , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ i@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no pri@@ vac@@ y .
P@@ eople su@@ ff@@ er men@@ t@@ ally and physi@@ cally .
"So we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the stu@@ dent v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with p@@ aper tu@@ be@@ s , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fra@@ me and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , some of the fac@@ ili@@ ty au@@ th@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really ne@@ cess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fla@@ t area to build stan@@ d@@ ard government sin@@ g@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"L@@ o@@ ok at this . E@@ ven ci@@ vi@@ l government is doing such po@@ or con@@ stru@@ ction of the temp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , so den@@ se and so me@@ ss@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is le@@ ak@@ ing , so I thought , we have to make multi@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I pro@@ posed to the ma@@ yor while I was making parti@@ tions .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very ni@@ ce ma@@ yor in O@@ na@@ ga@@ w@@ a vil@@ la@@ ge in M@@ iy@@ a@@ gi .
He asked me to build thre@@ e-@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing on bas@@ e@@ b@@ all &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ pp@@ ing con@@ tain@@ er and also the students help@@ ed us to make all the building f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to st@@ ay here for@@ ever .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the Jap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many Jap@@ an@@ ese students were also kil@@ led , and the most important ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral of the city , the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was tot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the temp@@ or@@ ary ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
So this is under con@@ stru@@ ction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ u@@ ments that are be@@ lo@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this bab@@ y &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ sts , would have said that this bab@@ y was ir@@ ra@@ tional , il@@ lo@@ gi@@ cal , e@@ go@@ cen@@ tri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the per@@ spe@@ ctive of another person or understand cause and effe@@ ct ."
"In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this bab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most br@@ il@@ li@@ ant scienti@@ sts ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this bab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ de@@ st for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and fe@@ eling ."
And maybe the har@@ de@@ st thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s fol@@ lo@@ wed poli@@ tics can te@@ sti@@ f@@ y to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if ba@@ bi@@ es and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ a@@ bi@@ es , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three ye@@ ar-@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness mon@@ olo@@ gue about p@@ on@@ ies and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the se@@ cre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — B@@ et@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the ba@@ bi@@ es two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of deli@@ ci@@ ous g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish cra@@ ck@@ ers ."
"Now all of the ba@@ bi@@ es , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ ley , like the cra@@ ck@@ ers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what B@@ et@@ ty did was to take a little tas@@ te of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she lik@@ ed it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she lik@@ ed the cra@@ ck@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a bab@@ y and any other san@@ e person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I tas@@ ted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cra@@ ck@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , yu@@ ck , cra@@ ck@@ ers ."
"I tas@@ ted the cra@@ ck@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , yu@@ ck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the ba@@ bi@@ es wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old ba@@ bi@@ es .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the bab@@ y give her , what they lik@@ ed or what she lik@@ ed ?"
"And the re@@ mark@@ able thing was that 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old ba@@ bi@@ es , just bar@@ ely wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cra@@ ck@@ ers if she lik@@ ed the cra@@ ck@@ ers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she lik@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"O@@ n the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she lik@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cra@@ ck@@ ers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really re@@ mark@@ able things about this .
"The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old ba@@ bi@@ es have already disco@@ vered this really pro@@ found fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mark@@ ably though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this sug@@ ge@@ sts that these 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this de@@ ep , pro@@ found fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of stu@@ dies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a sh@@ ort time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at ba@@ bi@@ es su@@ per@@ f@@ ici@@ ally , they see@@ m pretty u@@ se@@ less ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than u@@ se@@ less , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ ep@@ ing them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we turn to ev@@ olution for an answer to this p@@ uz@@ z@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of u@@ se@@ less ba@@ bi@@ es , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ ma@@ tes , but also inclu@@ ding other ma@@ m@@ mal@@ s , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kan@@ gar@@ oo@@ s and wo@@ mb@@ at@@ s , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are comp@@ ared to their bo@@ dies and how smar@@ t and fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w .
"And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ ven@@ s , ro@@ ok@@ s and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly smar@@ t bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as smar@@ t as chi@@ mp@@ an@@ ze@@ es in some re@@ spe@@ cts .
And this is a bir@@ d on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a to@@ ol to get food .
"O@@ n the other hand , we have our friend the do@@ me@@ stic chi@@ c@@ ken ."
And chi@@ c@@ ken@@ s and du@@ cks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as du@@ m@@ b as du@@ mp@@ s .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at pe@@ c@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the ba@@ bi@@ es , the New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w ba@@ bi@@ es , are fle@@ d@@ g@@ lin@@ gs ."
"They de@@ p@@ end on their mo@@ ms to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bir@@ d ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the chi@@ c@@ ken@@ s are actually ma@@ ture within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the chi@@ c@@ ken@@ s end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that see@@ ms to be conne@@ cted to knowle@@ dge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the chi@@ c@@ ken , see@@ m to be beauti@@ ful@@ ly su@@ i@@ ted to doing just one thing very well ."
So they see@@ m to be beauti@@ ful@@ ly su@@ i@@ ted to pe@@ c@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ atu@@ res , like the cro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extre@@ me@@ ly good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion like the cro@@ ws ."
We have big@@ ger bra@@ ins rela@@ tive to our bo@@ dies by far than any other anima@@ l .
"We &apos;re smar@@ ter , we &apos;re more fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we survi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mi@@ gra@@ ted to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our ba@@ bi@@ es and children are de@@ pen@@ dent on us for much longer than the ba@@ bi@@ es of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still pop@@ p@@ ing those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ rela@@ tion ?"
"Well an idea is that that strate@@ gy , that learning strate@@ gy , is an extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , great strate@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ge ."
"And that one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ge is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be help@@ less ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ sto@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A s@@ lin@@ g@@ sho@@ t or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . W@@ hi@@ ch would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the ma@@ sto@@ d@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the ev@@ olu@@ tions see@@ ms to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of di@@ vision of la@@ b@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early peri@@ od when we &apos;re completely prote@@ cted .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were ba@@ bi@@ es and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that ba@@ bi@@ es and young children are like the research and develop@@ ment di@@ vision of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prote@@ cted b@@ lue sk@@ y guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produ@@ ction and mark@@ et@@ ing ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of ba@@ bi@@ es and children as being like de@@ fe@@ ctive grow@@ n@@ u@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental st@@ age of the same species — kind of like cat@@ er@@ p@@ il@@ lars and bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fli@@ es — ex@@ cept that they &apos;re actually the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fli@@ es who are fli@@ tting around the gar@@ den and exp@@ lor@@ ing , and we &apos;re the cat@@ er@@ p@@ il@@ lars who are in@@ ching along our n@@ ar@@ row , grow@@ n@@ up , a@@ du@@ l@@ t pat@@ h ."
"If this is true , if these ba@@ bi@@ es are desig@@ ned to learn — and this ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expe@@ ct that they would have really powerful learning me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the bab@@ y &apos;s brain see@@ ms to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ v@@ olution in our under@@ standing of machine learning re@@ cen@@ tly .
"And it all de@@ pen@@ ds on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s B@@ ay@@ es , who was a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an in the 18@@ th century ."
"And essen@@ ti@@ ally what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provi@@ de a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way using prob@@ ability the@@ ory to charac@@ ter@@ ize , des@@ cri@@ be , the way that scienti@@ sts find out about the world ."
So what scienti@@ sts do is they have a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis that they think might be lik@@ ely to start with .
They go out and test it against the ev@@ iden@@ ce .
The ev@@ iden@@ ce makes them change that hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ ay@@ es sho@@ wed was a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics is at the cor@@ e of the best machine learning progra@@ ms that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I sug@@ ge@@ s@@ ted that ba@@ bi@@ es might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those ba@@ bi@@ es are actually making compli@@ cated cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions with con@@ di@@ tional prob@@ a@@ bili@@ ties that they &apos;re re@@ vis@@ ing to figure out how the world works .
"A@@ ll right , now that might see@@ m like an even tal@@ ler order to actually de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ n@@ u@@ ps about sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , they look extre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ p@@ id ."
How could it be that children are doing sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ li@@ c@@ ket De@@ te@@ ctor .
This is a bo@@ x that li@@ ghts up and pla@@ ys music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple machine , my la@@ b and others have done do@@ zen@@ s of stu@@ dies sho@@ wing just how good ba@@ bi@@ es are at learning about the world ."
"L@@ et me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ u@@ ma@@ r K@@ u@@ sh@@ ner , my stu@@ dent ."
"If I sho@@ wed you this de@@ te@@ ctor , you would be lik@@ ely to think to be@@ gin with that the way to make the de@@ te@@ ctor go would be to put a blo@@ ck on top of the de@@ te@@ ctor ."
"But actually , this de@@ te@@ ctor works in a bit of a st@@ range way ."
"Because if you wa@@ ve a blo@@ ck over the top of the de@@ te@@ ctor , something you w@@ ouldn &apos;t ever think of to be@@ gin with , the de@@ te@@ ctor will actually ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if you do the lik@@ ely thing , put the blo@@ ck on the de@@ te@@ ctor , it will only ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis actually has st@@ ron@@ ger ev@@ iden@@ ce .
It looks as if the wa@@ ving is a more effe@@ ctive strate@@ gy than the other strate@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we gave four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds this patter@@ n of ev@@ iden@@ ce , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds used the ev@@ iden@@ ce to wa@@ ve the obje@@ ct on top of the de@@ te@@ ctor ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ con@@ sci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite compli@@ cated cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions that will give them a con@@ di@@ tional prob@@ ability meas@@ ure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that ev@@ iden@@ ce to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis about the world , that see@@ ms very un@@ lik@@ ely to be@@ gin with ."
"And in stu@@ dies we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , si@@ mi@@ lar stu@@ dies , we &apos;ve show that four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis than a@@ du@@ l@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same tas@@ k ."
"So in these cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , the children are using sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs to find out about the world , but after all , scienti@@ sts also do experim@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing experim@@ ents ."
Wh@@ en children do experim@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; pla@@ ying . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bun@@ ch of interesting stu@@ dies re@@ cen@@ tly that have sho@@ wn this pla@@ ying around is really a kind of experim@@ en@@ tal research program .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine Le@@ g@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ li@@ c@@ ket De@@ tec@@ tors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she sho@@ wed them an an@@ o@@ mal@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in the space of two minutes .
( Video ) B@@ o@@ y : How about this ?
Sa@@ me as the other side .
"A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : O@@ kay , so his first hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis has just been fal@@ si@@ fied ."
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ en@@ tal not@@ e@@ book out ."
B@@ o@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scienti@@ st will reco@@ gn@@ ize that ex@@ pres@@ sion of de@@ sp@@ air .
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis two ."
B@@ o@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experim@@ en@@ ter to do this , to try pu@@ tting it out on@@ to the other lo@@ cation ."
N@@ ot working e@@ ither .
"B@@ o@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ to@@ m of this bo@@ x has electri@@ city in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electri@@ city ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis ."
B@@ o@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis ."
"Now that is a particu@@ lar@@ ly — that is a particu@@ lar@@ ly ad@@ or@@ able and arti@@ cu@@ late little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine disco@@ vered is this is actually quite ty@@ pi@@ cal ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to expla@@ in something , what they really do is do a ser@@ ies of experim@@ ents ."
This is actually pretty ty@@ pi@@ cal of four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these br@@ il@@ li@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fli@@ es who can test five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ sts and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers , a lot of them have said that ba@@ bi@@ es and young children were bar@@ ely con@@ sci@@ ous if they were con@@ sci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
I think ba@@ bi@@ es and children are actually more con@@ sci@@ ous than we are as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how a@@ du@@ l@@ t con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness works .
And a@@ du@@ l@@ ts &apos; atten@@ tion and con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness look kind of like a sp@@ ot@@ light .
"So what happens for a@@ du@@ l@@ ts is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant or important , we should pay atten@@ tion to it ."
"O@@ ur con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to be@@ comes extre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dar@@ k ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we pay atten@@ tion is that the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ ecu@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a sig@@ n@@ al that makes a little part of our brain much more fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble , more pla@@ stic , better at learning , and sh@@ u@@ ts down ac@@ tivity in all the rest of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very focu@@ sed , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ dri@@ ven kind of atten@@ tion ."
"If we look at ba@@ bi@@ es and young children , we see something very different ."
I think ba@@ bi@@ es and young children see@@ m to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness than a sp@@ ot@@ light of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
So ba@@ bi@@ es and young children are very bad at n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sour@@ ces at once .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re flo@@ o@@ ded with these neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters that are really good at indu@@ cing learning and pla@@ sti@@ city , and the in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tor@@ y parts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that ba@@ bi@@ es and young children are bad at pay@@ ing atten@@ tion , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not pay@@ ing atten@@ tion ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of atten@@ tion , the kind of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , that we might expe@@ ct from those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fli@@ es who are desig@@ ned to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a tas@@ te of that kind of bab@@ y con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about cas@@ es where we &apos;re put in a new si@@ tu@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness con@@ tra@@ cts , it exp@@ an@@ ds , so that those three days in Par@@ is see@@ m to be more full of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , that wonderful co@@ f@@ fe@@ e you &apos;ve been dr@@ in@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually mi@@ mi@@ cs the effe@@ ct of those bab@@ y neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a bab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Par@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fan@@ tas@@ tic way to be , but it does t@@ end to leave you w@@ ak@@ ing up c@@ r@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck in the mor@@ ning . ( Laughter )"
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful ba@@ bi@@ es are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ e@@ la@@ ces and c@@ ross the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of ef@@ for@@ t into making ba@@ bi@@ es think like a@@ du@@ l@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fli@@ es , to have open@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , ima@@ gin@@ ation , crea@@ tivity , inno@@ v@@ ation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the a@@ du@@ l@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HI@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ca@@ mp@@ a@@ i@@ gn@@ er .
And this is the name of my ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n : S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n .
"In No@@ ve@@ mber of 200@@ 3 , I was in@@ vi@@ ted to take part in the la@@ un@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion — that is his HI@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that Man@@ de@@ la had when he was imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ ben I@@ s@@ land .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ so@@ u N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ st@@ age , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the arti@@ sts were in@@ vi@@ ted to jo@@ in Man@@ de@@ la in R@@ ob@@ ben I@@ s@@ land , where he was going to give a con@@ fer@@ ence to the world &apos;s pre@@ ss , standing in front of his for@@ mer pri@@ son cell ."
You can see the b@@ ars of the win@@ do@@ w there .
It was quite a mo@@ men@@ t@@ ous oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on for all of us .
"In that moment in time , Man@@ de@@ la told the world &apos;s pre@@ ss that there was a vir@@ tual gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that pos@@ t-@@ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id R@@ a@@ in@@ b@@ ow N@@ ation , a thou@@ s@@ and people were d@@ ying on a da@@ ily bas@@ is and that the front line v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge imp@@ act on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t realized that the HI@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mic was dire@@ c@@ tly af@@ fe@@ cting women in such a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left S@@ outh Africa , when I left C@@ ap@@ et@@ own , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , inter@@ vie@@ ws , talking and using my pla@@ t@@ form as a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to Man@@ de@@ la — out of re@@ spe@@ ct for the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ very@@ one in the world re@@ spe@@ cts N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la , everyone re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in S@@ outh Africa , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ ci@@ dents of trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us ?"
"I think that if I went out into the stre@@ et now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sho@@ c@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ tun@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ ki@@ e A@@ ch@@ ma@@ t , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n , an incredi@@ ble ca@@ mp@@ a@@ i@@ gn@@ er and ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st ."
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was we@@ aring a t-@@ shi@@ r@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a to@@ ol — this tel@@ ls you I am in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity with people who have HI@@ V , people who are living with HI@@ V ."
"And in a way because of the sti@@ g@@ ma , by we@@ aring this t-@@ shi@@ r@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , we can talk about this issu@@ e ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clos@@ et . &quot; &quot; I became a me@@ mber of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n and I &apos;m very p@@ rou@@ d to be a me@@ mber of that incredi@@ ble organiz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n with 80 percent me@@ mb@@ er@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are HI@@ V@@ -@@ posi@@ tive ."
They work in the field .
They have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living dire@@ c@@ tly with the effe@@ cts of the vir@@ us .
They have education progra@@ ms .
They bring out the issu@@ es of sti@@ g@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite extra@@ ordin@@ ary what they do .
"And y@@ es , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n has supp@@ or@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n in the way that I have tried to ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ ise fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fun@@ ding that I have man@@ a@@ ged to ra@@ ise has gone dire@@ c@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n and the incredi@@ ble work that they do , and are still contin@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ outh Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to supp@@ ort me .
I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"H@@ ere I am in O@@ s@@ l@@ o in Nor@@ way , getting a ni@@ ce , f@@ at che@@ ck ; sin@@ ging in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to ra@@ ise money ."
"In Jo@@ han@@ nes@@ bur@@ g , I had the opport@@ unity to play to a ma@@ in@@ ly wh@@ ite , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ cla@@ ss S@@ outh Afri@@ can audi@@ ence who en@@ ded up in te@@ ars because I use film cli@@ ps that really tou@@ ch the heart , the whole nature , of this ter@@ ri@@ ble tra@@ ge@@ dy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to av@@ o@@ id , because they are fa@@ ti@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solu@@ tions are ."
"A@@ ar@@ on M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ e@@ di , the cur@@ r@@ ent health min@@ ister , atten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opport@@ unity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his absolu@@ te comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absolu@@ tely ne@@ cess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ sh Par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land and HI@@ V .
"And I was sho@@ wing them my experi@@ ences and trying to , again , ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh with the wonderful Afri@@ can Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s C@@ ho@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being af@@ fe@@ cted by the A@@ I@@ D@@ S vir@@ us ."
I &apos;m si@@ tting here in New York with M@@ i@@ ch@@ el S@@ i@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the dire@@ ctor of U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very hon@@ or@@ ed by the fact that M@@ i@@ ch@@ el in@@ vi@@ ted me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing my pla@@ t@@ form and bro@@ a@@ den@@ ing my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The messa@@ ge that U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S are cur@@ ren@@ tly sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the vir@@ tual eli@@ min@@ ation of the trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed with political will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ gn@@ ant woman , who is HI@@ V posi@@ tive and we &apos;re s@@ mil@@ ing , both of us are s@@ mil@@ ing , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is rece@@ i@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take care of the bab@@ y she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her bab@@ y will rece@@ ive P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that bab@@ y can be born free of the vir@@ us ."
Now that is pre@@ ven@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mic .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le ."
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she re@@ presen@@ ts one of mil@@ lions of HI@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had HI@@ V vir@@ us — she died from A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ -@@ rela@@ ted il@@ l@@ ness .
"A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the vir@@ us , she was born with the vir@@ us ."
"And here she is at seven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one ye@@ ar-@@ old bab@@ y ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s su@@ ff@@ ering with ful@@ l-@@ blo@@ wn A@@ I@@ D@@ S and had p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia ."
We met her in a h@@ osp@@ ital in the E@@ as@@ ter@@ n C@@ ap@@ e and sp@@ ent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The do@@ c@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ al .
They put her on very speci@@ al n@@ u@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .

"So , it was obvi@@ ously — it was a very emo@@ tional en@@ coun@@ ter and left us fe@@ eling very re@@ son@@ ant with this dire@@ ct experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ ive months later , we went back to S@@ outh Africa to me@@ et A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again ."

They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the trans@@ formation that took place .

( Applause ) That r@@ ound of ap@@ plause is actually for the do@@ c@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the h@@ osp@@ ital who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of trans@@ formation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audi@@ ence , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have ac@@ cess to good n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion and good medi@@ cal care , and you believe that the M@@ il@@ len@@ ni@@ um Dev@@ el@@ op@@ ment G@@ o@@ als , speci@@ f@@ ically five and six , should be absolu@@ tely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa — could you ple@@ ase stand up ."

"F@@ if@@ ty years ago in the old So@@ vi@@ et Uni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was se@@ cre@@ tly moving a large obje@@ ct through a de@@ so@@ late coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ ith it , they were hop@@ ing to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ c@@ ket was huge .
And p@@ ac@@ ked in its n@@ ose was a sil@@ ver b@@ all with two radi@@ os inside .
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they la@@ un@@ ched their ro@@ c@@ ket ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scienti@@ sts wr@@ ote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
"In the ol@@ den days , exp@@ lor@@ ers like V@@ as@@ c@@ o da G@@ ama and C@@ olu@@ m@@ bu@@ s had the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al g@@ lo@@ be ."
Now we have the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to en@@ v@@ y us our jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets from &quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th do@@ cu@@ men@@ tar@@ y fe@@ ature , which is just about comple@@ ted ."
"It tel@@ ls the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a res@@ ult ."
"For days after the la@@ un@@ ch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was a wonderful cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on vi@@ sible by ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s , it in@@ spi@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally la@@ un@@ ched an obje@@ ct into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the media and the poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our ene@@ my had be@@ aten us in science and technology , and that they could now at@@ tac@@ k us with hy@@ dro@@ gen bo@@ mb@@ s , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ro@@ c@@ ket as an I@@ B@@ M mi@@ ss@@ ile ."
All h@@ ell bro@@ ke lo@@ ose .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great sho@@ cks to h@@ it America — hi@@ stor@@ i@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l Har@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ed the mi@@ ss@@ ile ga@@ p .
It exp@@ lo@@ ded an ar@@ ms ra@@ ce .
It began the space ra@@ ce .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in a year , Con@@ gre@@ ss fun@@ ded huge we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 200 n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar we@@ ap@@ ons to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k went far be@@ yon@@ d we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases .
"For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ un@@ e 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the Na@@ tional C@@ i@@ vi@@ l D@@ ef@@ en@@ se D@@ r@@ ill , where ten@@ s of mil@@ lions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ al@@ lu@@ p P@@ ol@@ l that sho@@ wed that seven in 10 Americ@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be kil@@ led ."
But S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ed wonderful changes as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ."
"S@@ u@@ pp@@ ort for engine@@ ering , ma@@ th and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ o@@ med ."
"And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k led dire@@ c@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ S@@ A ."
My fe@@ ature do@@ cu@@ men@@ tar@@ y sho@@ ws how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also sho@@ ws how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad si@@ tu@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"In clos@@ ing , I would like to take a moment to th@@ ank one of my inve@@ stor@@ s : lon@@ g@@ time TE@@ D@@ ster , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ k@@ er ."

I &apos;ve been at M@@ I@@ T for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvi@@ ous .
"H@@ a@@ ve they all a@@ gre@@ ed ? No , not completely ."
I &apos;ll bu@@ y it . I have so much money .
"I have so much money , it takes me for@@ ever ."
"I gre@@ w up in Bi@@ ha@@ r , India &apos;s po@@ or@@ est state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a car@@ t full of the most deli@@ ci@@ ous s@@ we@@ ets at our do@@ or@@ step ."
"My bro@@ thers and I du@@ g in , and that &apos;s when my father came home ."
"He was li@@ vi@@ d , and I still remember how we cri@@ ed when that car@@ t with our hal@@ f-@@ e@@ aten s@@ we@@ ets was pul@@ led away from us ."
"L@@ at@@ er , I under@@ sto@@ od why my father got so up@@ set ."
Th@@ ose s@@ we@@ ets were a bri@@ be from a con@@ tra@@ ctor who was trying to get my father to a@@ ward him a government con@@ tra@@ ct .
"My father was respon@@ sible for building ro@@ ads in Bi@@ ha@@ r , and he had develop@@ ed a fir@@ m stance against cor@@ rup@@ tion , even though he was har@@ as@@ sed and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ."
"H@@ is was a lon@@ ely stru@@ g@@ gle , because Bi@@ ha@@ r was also India &apos;s most cor@@ rup@@ t state , where public off@@ ici@@ als were en@@ ri@@ ching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than ser@@ ving the po@@ or who had no means to ex@@ pre@@ ss their an@@ gu@@ ish if their children had no food or no sch@@ o@@ ol@@ ing ."
And I experi@@ en@@ ced this most vis@@ cer@@ ally when I tra@@ ve@@ led to re@@ m@@ ote vil@@ la@@ ges to study po@@ ver@@ ty .
"And as I went vil@@ la@@ ge to vil@@ la@@ ge , I remember one day , when I was fa@@ mi@@ shed and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted , and I was almost col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing in a s@@ cor@@ ching he@@ at under a tre@@ e , and just at that time , one of the po@@ or@@ est men in that vil@@ la@@ ge in@@ vi@@ ted me into his h@@ ut and gra@@ ci@@ ously f@@ ed me ."
On@@ ly I later realized that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This pro@@ found gi@@ ft of gener@@ os@@ ity challen@@ ged and changed the very pur@@ p@@ ose of my life .
I res@@ olved to give back .
"L@@ at@@ er , I jo@@ ined the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , which s@@ ou@@ ght to fi@@ ght such po@@ ver@@ ty by trans@@ fer@@ r@@ ing a@@ id from ri@@ ch to po@@ or countries ."
"My in@@ iti@@ al work focu@@ sed on U@@ gan@@ da , where I focu@@ sed on ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating re@@ for@@ ms with the F@@ inan@@ ce M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of U@@ gan@@ da so they could ac@@ cess our lo@@ ans ."
"But after we dis@@ bur@@ sed the lo@@ ans , I remember a tri@@ p in U@@ gan@@ da where I found ne@@ w@@ ly built sch@@ o@@ ols without te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s or teach@@ ers , new health c@@ lin@@ ic@@ s without dru@@ gs , and the po@@ or once again without any vo@@ ice or re@@ course ."
It was Bi@@ ha@@ r all over again .
Bi@@ ha@@ r re@@ presen@@ ts the challenge of develop@@ ment : ab@@ je@@ ct po@@ ver@@ ty sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by cor@@ rup@@ tion .
"G@@ lob@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1@@ .@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in U@@ gan@@ da re@@ presen@@ ts the tradi@@ tional appro@@ ach to these problems that has been pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed since 19@@ 4@@ 4 , when win@@ ners of Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I , 500 f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ ely f@@ oun@@ ding mother , ga@@ ther@@ ed in New Ha@@ mp@@ shi@@ re , U@@ S@@ A , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the B@@ re@@ tt@@ on W@@ oo@@ ds in@@ stitu@@ tions , inclu@@ ding the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank ."
"And that tradi@@ tional appro@@ ach to develop@@ ment had three key ele@@ ments . F@@ ir@@ st , trans@@ fer of resour@@ ces from ri@@ ch countries in the Nor@@ th to po@@ or@@ er countries in the S@@ outh , ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by re@@ form pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the develop@@ ment in@@ stitu@@ tions that chan@@ ne@@ led these trans@@ f@@ ers were op@@ a@@ que , with little trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy of what they finan@@ ced or what res@@ ul@@ ts they ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed ."
"And third , the en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment in develop@@ ing countries was with a n@@ ar@@ row set of government eli@@ tes with little inter@@ action with the ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s , who are the ulti@@ mate ben@@ ef@@ ici@@ ar@@ ies of develop@@ ment as@@ si@@ stance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , each of these ele@@ ments is open@@ ing up du@@ e to dra@@ ma@@ tic changes in the global environment ."
"O@@ p@@ en knowle@@ dge , open a@@ id , open govern@@ ance , and together , they re@@ present three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are trans@@ for@@ ming develop@@ ment and that also h@@ old gre@@ at@@ er hope for the problems I wit@@ nes@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open knowle@@ dge .
"You know , develop@@ ing countries today will not simply ac@@ cept solu@@ tions that are han@@ ded down to them by the U.@@ S@@ . , Euro@@ pe or the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank ."
"They get their in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion , their hope , their pra@@ c@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from suc@@ cess@@ ful emer@@ ging economi@@ es in the S@@ outh ."
"They want to know how China li@@ f@@ ted 500 million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty in 30 years , how M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ p@@ ort@@ uni@@ da@@ des program im@@ pro@@ ved sch@@ o@@ ol@@ ing and n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion for mil@@ lions of children ."
"This is the new ec@@ osy@@ ste@@ m of open@@ -@@ knowle@@ dge flo@@ ws , not just tra@@ v@@ eling Nor@@ th to S@@ outh , but S@@ outh to S@@ outh , and even S@@ outh to Nor@@ th , with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ p@@ ort@@ uni@@ da@@ des today in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing New York C@@ ity ."
"And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ S@@ outh trans@@ f@@ ers are open@@ ing up , so too are the develop@@ ment in@@ stitu@@ tions that chan@@ ne@@ led these trans@@ f@@ ers ."
This is the second shi@@ ft : open a@@ id .
"@@ Re@@ cen@@ tly , the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank open@@ ed its va@@ ult of data for public use , re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 8@@ ,000 economic and social indi@@ cat@@ ors for 200 countries over 50 years , and it la@@ un@@ ched a global com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion to cro@@ w@@ d@@ sour@@ ce inno@@ va@@ tive app@@ s using this data ."
Dev@@ el@@ op@@ ment in@@ stitu@@ tions today are also open@@ ing for public s@@ cru@@ tin@@ y the proje@@ cts they finan@@ ce .
"T@@ ake Ge@@ o@@ M@@ app@@ ing . In this ma@@ p from Ken@@ ya , the red d@@ ots show where all the sch@@ o@@ ols finan@@ ced by don@@ ors are lo@@ cated , and the d@@ ark@@ er the s@@ ha@@ de of gre@@ en , the more the number of out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children ."
"So this simple ma@@ sh@@ up re@@ ve@@ als that don@@ ors have not finan@@ ced any sch@@ o@@ ols in the are@@ as with the most out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children , pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ing new questions . I@@ s develop@@ ment as@@ si@@ stance tar@@ ge@@ ting those who most need our help ?"
"In this man@@ ner , the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank has now Ge@@ o@@ M@@ app@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 project ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties in 1@@ 4@@ 3 countries , and don@@ ors are using a common pla@@ t@@ form to ma@@ p all their proje@@ cts ."
This is a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous lea@@ p for@@ ward in trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy and ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility of a@@ id .
"And this lea@@ ds me to the third , and in my view , the most sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant shi@@ ft in develop@@ ment : open govern@@ ance . G@@ over@@ n@@ ments today are open@@ ing up just as ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s are de@@ man@@ ding vo@@ ice and ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility ."
"F@@ rom the Ara@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ na H@@ az@@ are mo@@ vement in India , using mo@@ bile ph@@ ones and social media not just for political ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility but also for develop@@ ment ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments deli@@ ver@@ ing serv@@ ices to the ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s ?
"So for in@@ stance , sever@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ as@@ ter@@ n Euro@@ pe are open@@ ing their bu@@ d@@ gets to the public ."
"But , you know , there is a big difference between a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s public and a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sible ."
"This is a public bu@@ d@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sible or under@@ stan@@ da@@ ble to an ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is sp@@ en@@ ding its resour@@ ces ."
"T@@ o tac@@ k@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new to@@ ols to vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize the bu@@ d@@ get so it &apos;s more under@@ stan@@ da@@ ble to the public ."
"In this ma@@ p from M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , the gre@@ en col@@ or sho@@ ws those di@@ stri@@ cts that have low sp@@ en@@ ding on sch@@ o@@ ols but good edu@@ ca@@ tional out@@ comes , and the red col@@ or sho@@ ws the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f full of in@@ s@@ cru@@ table do@@ cu@@ ments into a publi@@ c@@ ly under@@ stan@@ da@@ ble vis@@ ual , and what &apos;s ex@@ c@@ iting is that with this open@@ ness , there are today new opport@@ uni@@ ties for ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s to give fe@@ ed@@ back and en@@ ga@@ ge with government ."
"So in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines today , parents and students can give real@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a we@@ b@@ site , C@@ he@@ ck@@ my@@ sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether teach@@ ers and te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s are sho@@ wing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ nes@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
"And the government is respon@@ sive . So for in@@ stance , when it was re@@ por@@ ted on this we@@ b@@ site that 8@@ 00 students were at risk because school re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s had st@@ al@@ led du@@ e to cor@@ rup@@ tion , the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ du@@ cation in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines took s@@ wi@@ ft action ."
"And you know what &apos;s ex@@ c@@ iting is that this inno@@ v@@ ation is now sp@@ read@@ ing S@@ outh to S@@ outh , from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines to In@@ don@@ e@@ si@@ a , Ken@@ ya , M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a and be@@ yon@@ d ."
"In D@@ ar es S@@ ala@@ am , Tan@@ z@@ an@@ ia , even an im@@ po@@ ver@@ ish@@ ed community was able to use these to@@ ols to vo@@ ice its as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions ."
"This is what the ma@@ p of Tan@@ dal@@ e looked like in Au@@ gu@@ st , 20@@ 11 . But within a few we@@ eks , uni@@ versity students were able to use mo@@ bile ph@@ ones and an open@@ -@@ sour@@ ce pla@@ t@@ form to dra@@ ma@@ tically ma@@ p the entire community inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture ."
"And what is very ex@@ c@@ iting is that ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s were then able to give fe@@ ed@@ back as to which health or water poin@@ ts were not working , ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ ted in the red bu@@ b@@ b@@ les that you see , which together pro@@ vide@@ s a grap@@ hi@@ c vis@@ ual of the colle@@ ctive vo@@ ices of the po@@ or ."
"T@@ o@@ day , even Bi@@ ha@@ r is tur@@ ning around and open@@ ing up under a comm@@ it@@ ted lea@@ der@@ ship that is making government trans@@ par@@ ent , ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sible and respon@@ sive to the po@@ or ."
"But , you know , in many parts of the world , govern@@ ments are not interested in open@@ ing up or in ser@@ ving the po@@ or , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system ."
"These are the lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of develop@@ ment work is to help these lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors jo@@ in hands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds ."
"So for in@@ stance , today , in G@@ h@@ ana , cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous re@@ for@@ mers from ci@@ vi@@ l society , Par@@ li@@ a@@ ment and government , have for@@ ged a co@@ ali@@ tion for trans@@ par@@ ent con@@ tra@@ cts in the oil se@@ ctor , and , g@@ al@@ van@@ ized by this , re@@ for@@ mers in Par@@ li@@ a@@ ment are now inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous con@@ tra@@ cts ."
"These exa@@ mp@@ les give new hope , new possi@@ bility to the problems I wit@@ nes@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , on Ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was ty@@ p@@ ing a 7@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge public inter@@ est li@@ ti@@ ga@@ tion against cor@@ rup@@ tion in a ro@@ ad project ."
"Th@@ ough he was no la@@ w@@ yer , he ar@@ gu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t hi@@ m@@ self the next day . He won the r@@ ul@@ ing , but later that very ev@@ en@@ ing , he f@@ ell , and he died ."
"He f@@ ou@@ ght ti@@ ll the end , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly pas@@ sion@@ ate that to com@@ b@@ at cor@@ rup@@ tion and po@@ ver@@ ty , not only did government off@@ ici@@ als need to be hon@@ est , but ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s needed to jo@@ in together to make their vo@@ ices heard ."
"These became the two book@@ ends of his life , and the jour@@ ney he tra@@ ve@@ led in between mi@@ r@@ r@@ or@@ ed the chan@@ ging develop@@ ment lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m in@@ spi@@ red by these changes , and I &apos;m ex@@ ci@@ ted that at the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , we are e@@ mb@@ ra@@ cing these new dire@@ ctions , a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ gan@@ da 20 years ago ."
"We need to radi@@ cally open up develop@@ ment so knowle@@ dge flo@@ ws in multi@@ ple dire@@ ctions , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing pra@@ cti@@ tion@@ ers , so a@@ id be@@ comes trans@@ par@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and effe@@ ctive , so govern@@ ments open up and ci@@ ti@@ zen@@ s are en@@ ga@@ ged and emp@@ o@@ wer@@ ed with re@@ for@@ mers in government ."
We need to ac@@ ce@@ ler@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .
"If we do , we will find that the colle@@ ctive vo@@ ices of the po@@ or will be heard in Bi@@ ha@@ r , in U@@ gan@@ da , and be@@ yon@@ d ."
We will find that te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s and teach@@ ers will show up in sch@@ o@@ ols for their children .
"We will find that these children , too , have a real chan@@ ce of bre@@ ak@@ ing their way out of po@@ ver@@ ty ."
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Now imagine that 60 plan@@ es full of ba@@ bi@@ es under five c@@ ras@@ h every single day .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
"M@@ ost of these de@@ a@@ ths are pre@@ ven@@ table , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sa@@ d , it makes me an@@ gr@@ y , and it makes me de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed ."
"D@@ i@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a and p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia are a@@ mon@@ g the top two kil@@ ler@@ s of children under five , and what we can do to pre@@ v@@ ent these dise@@ ases isn &apos;t some smar@@ t , new technologi@@ cal inno@@ va@@ tions ."
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ de@@ st inven@@ tions : a b@@ ar of so@@ ap .
"W@@ as@@ h@@ ing hands with so@@ ap , a ha@@ bit we all take for gran@@ ted , can re@@ du@@ ce di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a by half , can re@@ du@@ ce re@@ spi@@ ra@@ tor@@ y in@@ fe@@ ctions by one third ."
"H@@ an@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap can have an imp@@ act on re@@ du@@ cing f@@ lu , tra@@ cho@@ ma , S@@ A@@ R@@ S , and most re@@ cen@@ tly in the case of ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a and E@@ b@@ ol@@ a out@@ bre@@ ak , one of the key inter@@ ven@@ tions is han@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap ."
H@@ an@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap ke@@ ep@@ s kids in school .
It st@@ op@@ s ba@@ bi@@ es from d@@ ying .
H@@ an@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap is one of the most cos@@ t-@@ effe@@ ctive ways of sa@@ ving children &apos;s lives .
"It can sa@@ ve over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of st@@ opp@@ ing 10 ju@@ mb@@ o j@@ ets full of ba@@ bi@@ es and children from c@@ ras@@ h@@ ing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll a@@ gre@@ e with me that that &apos;s a pretty u@@ se@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a minu@@ te .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just s@@ ha@@ ke their hands .
P@@ le@@ ase s@@ ha@@ ke their hands .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose hands you just sho@@ ok actually didn &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they were coming out of the to@@ ile@@ t ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ re@@ tty yu@@ ck@@ y , you would a@@ gre@@ e with me ."
"Well , sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs are actually sho@@ wing that four people out of five don &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they come out of the to@@ ile@@ t , glob@@ ally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fan@@ cy to@@ ile@@ ts , run@@ ning water , and so@@ ap a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mor@@ tal@@ ity is really high ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ ap ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ ap is a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble ."
"In 9@@ 0 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in Ken@@ ya , you will find so@@ ap ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ ap is the lo@@ we@@ st , like E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why ar@@ en &apos;t people was@@ h@@ ing their hands ?
"Wh@@ y is it that M@@ ay@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in India , isn &apos;t was@@ h@@ ing his hands ?"
"Well , in M@@ ay@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ ap is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ ap is used for la@@ un@@ dr@@ y , so@@ ap is used for was@@ h@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t was@@ te it .
"O@@ n a@@ verage , in M@@ ay@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use so@@ ap for was@@ h@@ ing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for was@@ h@@ ing hands with so@@ ap ."
What &apos;s the res@@ ult of that ?
Th@@ ink about where you learned to was@@ h your hands .
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scienti@@ sts will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ bi@@ ts that you have had early in life .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , we all cop@@ y what everyone else does , and local cul@@ tu@@ ral nor@@ ms are something that shap@@ e how we change our behavi@@ or , and this is where the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ ctor comes in ."
"E@@ very second in A@@ si@@ a and Africa , 1@@ 11 mo@@ thers will bu@@ y this b@@ ar to prote@@ ct their family ."
"M@@ any women in India will tell you they learned all about hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , dise@@ ases , from this b@@ ar of so@@ ap from Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and ."
I@@ con@@ ic b@@ ran@@ ds like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they se@@ ll their produ@@ cts .
"It &apos;s that beli@@ ef , p@@ lu@@ s the scale of Uni@@ le@@ ver , that allo@@ ws us to keep talking about han@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e to these mo@@ thers ."
Bi@@ g busin@@ es@@ ses and b@@ ran@@ ds can change and shi@@ ft those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those ha@@ bi@@ ts that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Th@@ ink about it : Mar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into comp@@ el@@ ling messa@@ ges ."
"@@ Ju@@ st for a minu@@ te , imagine when they put all their for@@ ces behind a messa@@ ge as powerful as han@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap ."
The prof@@ it mo@@ tive is trans@@ for@@ ming health out@@ comes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es : the Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and was la@@ un@@ ched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ian En@@ g@@ land to actually com@@ b@@ at ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a .
"L@@ ast week , I was in G@@ h@@ ana with the min@@ ister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a out@@ bre@@ ak in G@@ h@@ ana at the moment ."
"A hun@@ d@@ red and e@@ igh@@ te@@ en years later , the solu@@ tion is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have ac@@ cess to this b@@ ar of so@@ ap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a from sp@@ read@@ ing ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for prof@@ it is extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most comm@@ it@@ ted char@@ ity or government ."
"G@@ over@@ n@@ ment is doing what they can , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in terms of the pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs and ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ cs such as ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a , or E@@ b@@ ol@@ a at the moment , but with comp@@ et@@ ing pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
The bu@@ d@@ get is not always there .
"We have friends like U@@ S@@ A@@ I@@ D , the G@@ lob@@ al P@@ u@@ bli@@ c@@ -@@ P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate P@@ art@@ ner@@ ship for H@@ an@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with So@@ ap , L@@ on@@ don S@@ ch@@ ool of H@@ y@@ gi@@ en@@ e and T@@ ro@@ pi@@ cal M@@ edi@@ cine , P@@ lan , W@@ at@@ er@@ A@@ id , that all believe for a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ w@@ in part@@ ner@@ ship ."
"W@@ in for the public se@@ ctor , because we help them re@@ ach their tar@@ gets ."
"W@@ in for the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ ctor , because we build new gener@@ ations of future han@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ers ."
"And most imp@@ or@@ tan@@ tly , w@@ in for the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able ."
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 15 , we will ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te G@@ lob@@ al H@@ an@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing D@@ ay ."
"S@@ cho@@ ols , communi@@ ties , our friends in the public se@@ ctor and our friends in the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ ctor — y@@ es , on that day even our com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors , we all jo@@ in hands to ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te the world &apos;s most important public health inter@@ ven@@ tion ."
"What &apos;s re@@ qui@@ red , and again where the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ ctor can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , crea@@ tive thinking that dri@@ ves ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ac@@ y ."
"If you take our H@@ el@@ p a Ch@@ il@@ d R@@ each 5 ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n , we &apos;ve created great fil@@ ms that bring the messa@@ ge of han@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap to the every@@ day person in a way that can rela@@ te to them ."
We &apos;ve had over 30 million vie@@ ws .
M@@ ost of these dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sions are still happening on@@ line .
I ur@@ ge you to take five minutes and look at those fil@@ ms .
"I come from M@@ al@@ i , one of the world &apos;s po@@ or@@ est countries ."
I gre@@ w up in a family where every din@@ ner conver@@ sa@@ tion was around social ju@@ sti@@ ce .
I tra@@ ined in Euro@@ pe &apos;s pre@@ mi@@ er school of public health .
"I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high de@@ gre@@ e in health , and the only one with a do@@ c@@ tor@@ ate in han@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ ap ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ine years ago , I decided , with a suc@@ cess@@ ful public health car@@ e@@ er in the making , that I could make the big@@ gest imp@@ act coming , sel@@ ling and pro@@ mot@@ ing the world &apos;s best inven@@ tion in public health : so@@ ap ."
We run today the world &apos;s lar@@ gest han@@ d@@ was@@ h@@ ing program by any public health stan@@ dar@@ ds .
We &apos;ve re@@ ach@@ ed over 18@@ 3 million people in 1@@ 6 countries .
My team and I have the am@@ bi@@ tion to re@@ ach one billion by 20@@ 20 .
"O@@ ver the last four years , business has gro@@ wn d@@ ou@@ ble di@@ git@@ s , wh@@ il@@ st child mor@@ tal@@ ity has re@@ du@@ ced in all the places where so@@ ap use has incre@@ as@@ ed ."
It may be un@@ com@@ for@@ table for some to hear — business growth and lives sa@@ ved some@@ how equ@@ ated in the same sen@@ t@@ ence — but it is that business growth that allo@@ ws us to keep doing more .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out it , and without talking about it , we cannot ac@@ hi@@ eve the change that we need ."
"L@@ ast week , my team and I sp@@ ent time vi@@ si@@ ting mo@@ thers that have all experi@@ en@@ ced the same thing : the death of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
I &apos;m a mo@@ m . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more pain@@ ful .
This one is from M@@ yan@@ ma@@ r .
"S@@ he had the most beautiful sm@@ ile , the sm@@ ile , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second chan@@ ce ."
"Her son , M@@ y@@ o , is her second one ."
"S@@ he had a da@@ u@@ ghter who pas@@ sed away at three we@@ eks , and we know that the maj@@ or@@ ity of children that actually die die in the first mon@@ th of their life , and we know that if we give a b@@ ar of so@@ ap to every s@@ kil@@ led bir@@ th atten@@ d@@ ant , and that if so@@ ap is used before tou@@ ching the ba@@ bi@@ es , we can re@@ du@@ ce and make a change in terms of those num@@ bers ."
"And that &apos;s what in@@ spi@@ res me , in@@ spi@@ res me to contin@@ ue in this mis@@ sion , to know that I can equ@@ ip her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing her ne@@ w@@ born ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mo@@ m and her family , don &apos;t look far : bu@@ y her so@@ ap ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful inven@@ tion in public health .
The fact that some of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms car@@ ri@@ ed person@@ al ite@@ ms such as to@@ o@@ th@@ pas@@ te and a to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh is a cle@@ ar sig@@ n they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
But that can &apos;t be right .
I am for cho@@ co@@ late don@@ u@@ ts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of f@@ un ."
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"S@@ ince we are still real@@ iz@@ ing these works , we are lar@@ ge@@ ly working within the real@@ m of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion and my@@ ster@@ y , still ."
So I &apos;m going to try and des@@ cri@@ be some of the experi@@ ences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the I@@ mp@@ er@@ i@@ al M@@ on@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ mes .
"A vie@@ wer sort of un@@ su@@ spe@@ c@@ tin@@ g@@ ly wal@@ ks into the room , and cat@@ ches a gli@@ mp@@ se of these pan@@ els in a me@@ ss@@ y comp@@ os@@ i@@ tion on the w@@ all ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in secon@@ ds , as if the pan@@ els have no@@ tic@@ ed the presen@@ ce of the vie@@ wer , they appe@@ ar to pan@@ ic and sort of get into a stri@@ ct sy@@ mme@@ try ."
( Laughter ) So this is the s@@ ket@@ ch of the two sta@@ tes .
One is tot@@ al cha@@ os . The other is absolu@@ te order .
And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ tor@@ i@@ al tradi@@ tions .
"One is the alt@@ ar tab@@ le@@ ts of the 1@@ 5@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , M@@ al@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s ab@@ stra@@ ct comp@@ os@@ i@@ tions ."
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
"T@@ o give you a sense of scale , the lar@@ gest pan@@ el is about two me@@ ters high ."
That &apos;s about this much . And the s@@ mal@@ le@@ st one is an A@@ 4 .
"So a vie@@ wer en@@ ters the space , and they s@@ na@@ p to atten@@ tion ."
"And after a while , if the vie@@ wer contin@@ u@@ es to re@@ ma@@ in in the space , the pan@@ els will sort of become im@@ m@@ un@@ e to the presen@@ ce of the vie@@ wer and become la@@ x and au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous again , until they sort of sense a presen@@ ce in the room or a mo@@ vement , when they will again s@@ na@@ p to atten@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) So here it appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s the vie@@ wer that &apos;s sort of in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating the sense of order a@@ mon@@ g the pan@@ els , but it could also be the other way around , that the pan@@ els are so stu@@ ck within their pre@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed behavi@@ ors that they sort of th@@ ru@@ st the vie@@ wer with the r@@ ole of a ty@@ r@@ ant ."
"So this br@@ ings me to a qui@@ et@@ er , small work called H@@ an@@ d@@ hel@@ d ."
"The vie@@ wer se@@ es a piece of p@@ aper that &apos;s m@@ oun@@ ted on the far end of the w@@ all , but when you go clos@@ er , you see that it &apos;s a b@@ lan@@ k A@@ 4 , or a let@@ ter@@ -@@ siz@@ ed piece of p@@ aper , that &apos;s hel@@ d on e@@ ither side by two small hands that appe@@ ar to be car@@ ved with a great deal of atten@@ tion and care from a small blo@@ ck of wo@@ od ."
"The vie@@ wer also se@@ es that this entire s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture is sort of moving very sli@@ gh@@ tly , as if these two hands are trying to h@@ old the p@@ aper very still for a long peri@@ od of time , and some@@ how are not man@@ a@@ ging to ."
So this in@@ sta@@ bility in the mo@@ vement very clos@@ ely re@@ se@@ mb@@ les the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of ima@@ ges seen through a han@@ d@@ hel@@ d ca@@ mera .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tan@@ de@@ m cli@@ ps .
One is through a still ca@@ mera and the other is through a han@@ d@@ hel@@ d ca@@ mera .
And you im@@ medi@@ ately see how the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of the video sug@@ ge@@ sts the presen@@ ce of an ob@@ ser@@ ver and a sub@@ je@@ ctive point of view .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ mo@@ ved the ca@@ mera and trans@@ fer@@ red that mo@@ vement on@@ to the pan@@ el .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
"But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to ev@@ ok@@ e a self-@@ e@@ ff@@ ac@@ ing ge@@ st@@ ure , as if there &apos;s a little person with out@@ st@@ ret@@ ched ar@@ ms behind this en@@ or@@ mous piece of p@@ aper ."
That sort of lik@@ en@@ s it to the amount of stra@@ in to be at the ser@@ vice of the ob@@ ser@@ ver and present this piece of p@@ aper very deli@@ ca@@ tely to the vie@@ wer in front of them .
The next work is De@@ co@@ y .
"This is a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard model , so the obje@@ ct is about as t@@ all as I am ."
"It has a r@@ oun@@ ded body , two ar@@ ms , and a very t@@ all , he@@ ad@@ -@@ like an@@ ten@@ na , and its s@@ ole pur@@ p@@ ose is to at@@ tra@@ ct atten@@ tion to@@ wards itself ."
"So when a vie@@ wer pas@@ ses by , it sort of ti@@ l@@ ts from side to side , and mo@@ ves its ar@@ ms more and more f@@ ran@@ tically as the person gets clos@@ er ."
So here is the first test s@@ cen@@ ar@@ i@@ o .
"You see the two mo@@ ve@@ ments in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted , and the obje@@ ct see@@ ms to be emp@@ lo@@ ying its entire being in this ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ per@@ ation ."
"But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s atten@@ tion , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person wh@@ ose atten@@ tion to get ."
( Laughter ) So this is the fin@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cated body of the De@@ co@@ y .
It appe@@ ars to be mas@@ s@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red like it came out of a fac@@ tor@@ y like vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers and was@@ h@@ ing mach@@ ines .
"Because we are always working from a very person@@ al space , we like how this consu@@ mer a@@ es@@ the@@ tic sort of de@@ person@@ al@@ iz@@ es the obje@@ ct and gi@@ ves us a bit of di@@ stance in its appe@@ ar@@ ance , at least ."
"And so to us this is a kind of sin@@ ister being which is trying to di@@ stra@@ ct you from the things that actually need your atten@@ tion , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help ."
"The next work is an obje@@ ct , that &apos;s also a kind of sound in@@ stru@@ ment ."
In the shap@@ e of an amp@@ hi@@ the@@ at@@ er that &apos;s scal@@ ed to the size of an audi@@ ence as per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved from somebody from the st@@ age .
"So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appe@@ ars to be this big , and the audi@@ ence sort of takes the entire field of my vision ."
Se@@ ated in this audi@@ ence are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small fi@@ gu@@ res .
They &apos;re me@@ chan@@ ically en@@ ab@@ led to cla@@ p of their own free will .
"This means that each of them can deci@@ de if and when they want to cla@@ p , how hard , for how long , how they want to be inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by those around them or inf@@ lu@@ ence others , and if they want to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to inno@@ v@@ ation ."
"So when the vie@@ wer ste@@ ps in front of the audi@@ ence , there will be a respon@@ se ."
"It could be a few cl@@ ap@@ s or a str@@ ong ap@@ plause , and then nothing happens until the vie@@ wer lea@@ ves the st@@ age , and again the audi@@ ence will respon@@ d ."
"It could be anything from a few fe@@ e@@ ble cl@@ ap@@ s from me@@ mb@@ ers in the audi@@ ence , or it could be a very l@@ ou@@ d o@@ v@@ ation ."
"So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audi@@ ence as its own obje@@ ct or its own organ@@ ism that &apos;s also got a sort of mu@@ si@@ cal@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it , an in@@ stru@@ ment ."
"So the vie@@ wer can play it by eli@@ c@@ iting quite comple@@ x and vari@@ ed , n@@ u@@ an@@ ced mu@@ si@@ cal or sound patter@@ ns , but cannot really pro@@ v@@ ok@@ e the audi@@ ence into any particular kind of respon@@ se ."
So there &apos;s a sense of ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment and cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness and un@@ eas@@ in@@ ess inv@@ olved .
It also has an al@@ l@@ ur@@ ing and tr@@ ap@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite ex@@ ci@@ ted about the image of the head sp@@ li@@ tting to form the two hands .
"So here &apos;s a small vis@@ ual anima@@ tion , as if the two si@@ des of the brain are sort of cla@@ sh@@ ing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the ten@@ sion ."
And here is a prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be en@@ g@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"O@@ kay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the F@@ ra@@ mer@@ un@@ ners ."
It comes out of the idea of a win@@ do@@ w .
"This is an ac@@ tual win@@ do@@ w in our stu@@ di@@ o , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ic@@ k@@ nes@@ ses of w@@ oo@@ den se@@ ctions ."
So we used the same win@@ do@@ w v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y to con@@ stru@@ ct our own fra@@ me or g@@ ri@@ d that &apos;s su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in the room and that can be vie@@ wed from two si@@ des .
This g@@ ri@@ d is in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted by a tri@@ be of small fi@@ gu@@ res .
"They &apos;re also made up of three different siz@@ es , as if to sug@@ gest a kind of per@@ spe@@ ctive or lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e on the single pla@@ in ."
E@@ ach of these fi@@ gu@@ res can also run bac@@ k@@ ward and for@@ ward in the tra@@ ck and hi@@ de behind two ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent tra@@ cks .
"So in con@@ tr@@ ast to this very ti@@ ght g@@ ri@@ d , we wanted to give these fi@@ gu@@ res a very co@@ mi@@ cal and s@@ l@@ ap@@ sti@@ ck@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality , as if a pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er has taken them and physi@@ cally anima@@ ted them down the pat@@ h ."
"So we like the idea of these fi@@ gu@@ res sort of s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ing along like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and car@@ ef@@ ree and happ@@ y@@ -@@ go@@ -@@ lu@@ ck@@ y and con@@ t@@ ent , until they sort of sense a mo@@ vement from the vie@@ wer and they will hi@@ de behind the fas@@ test w@@ all ."
"So to us , this work also presen@@ ts its own con@@ tradi@@ ction ."
"These fi@@ gu@@ res are sort of en@@ tr@@ app@@ ed within this very str@@ ong g@@ ri@@ d , which is like a pri@@ son , but also a for@@ tre@@ ss , because it allo@@ ws them to be ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and na@@ ive and car@@ ef@@ ree and quite ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world ."
"So all these real life qu@@ ali@@ ties that I talk about are sort of trans@@ la@@ ted to a very speci@@ fic tech@@ ni@@ cal con@@ fi@@ gu@@ ra@@ tion , and we were very lu@@ ck@@ y to col@@ labor@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Z@@ u@@ ri@@ ch to devel@@ op the first prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ."
So you see they extra@@ cted the mo@@ tion co@@ gs from our anima@@ tions and created a wi@@ g@@ gle that in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted the he@@ ad@@ -@@ bo@@ b@@ b@@ ing mo@@ vement and the bac@@ k@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ for@@ th mo@@ vement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can f@@ it into the p@@ al@@ m of my hand .
"So imagine our ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment when we saw it really working in the stu@@ di@@ o , and here it is ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"So in colle@@ ge , I was a government maj@@ or , which means I had to wr@@ ite a lot of p@@ ap@@ ers ."
"Now , when a normal stu@@ dent w@@ ri@@ tes a p@@ aper , they might sp@@ read the work out a little like this ."
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pla@@ n .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the p@@ aper would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single p@@ aper .
"But then came my 9@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge sen@@ i@@ or the@@ sis , a p@@ aper you &apos;re su@@ p@@ posed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a p@@ aper like that , my normal work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
"So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bu@@ mp it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would k@@ ic@@ k it up into high ge@@ ar just like a little sta@@ ir@@ case ."
How hard could it be to walk up the sta@@ ir@@ s ?
"N@@ o big deal , right ?"
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff ."
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two we@@ eks ."
"And one day I w@@ ok@@ e up with three days until the de@@ ad@@ line , still not having wr@@ it@@ ten a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wr@@ ote 9@@ 0 pa@@ ges over 7@@ 2 hours , pul@@ ling not one but two al@@ l-@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — humans are not su@@ p@@ posed to pul@@ l two al@@ l-@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — sp@@ r@@ in@@ ted across ca@@ mp@@ us , do@@ ve in s@@ low mo@@ tion , and got it in just at the de@@ ad@@ line ."
I thought that was the end of everything .
"It was a very , very bad the@@ sis . ( Laughter )"
"N@@ o , no , it was very , very bad ."
"An@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a wr@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ blo@@ g@@ ger guy ."
I want you to take a look car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly to see if you can no@@ ti@@ ce a difference .
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"B@@ ot@@ h bra@@ ins have a R@@ a@@ tional De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er in them , but the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ or &apos;s brain also has an In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key ."
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the sch@@ edu@@ le for any work today ."
He lives enti@@ re@@ ly in the present moment .
"He has no me@@ mor@@ y of the past , no knowle@@ dge of the future , and he only car@@ es about two things : easy and f@@ un ."
"Now , in the anima@@ l world , that works f@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;re a do@@ g and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and f@@ un things , you &apos;re a huge suc@@ cess !@@ "
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , humans are just another anima@@ l species ."
"You have to keep wel@@ l-@@ s@@ le@@ pt , wel@@ l-@@ f@@ ed and pro@@ pa@@ g@@ ating into the next gener@@ ation , which in tri@@ b@@ al times might have worked OK ."
"But , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t no@@ tic@@ ed , now we &apos;re not in tri@@ b@@ al times ."
"We &apos;re in an ad@@ van@@ ced ci@@ vi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
"W@@ hi@@ ch is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ a@@ tional De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er , who gi@@ ves us the ability to do things no other anima@@ l can do ."
We can vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize the future .
We can see the big picture .
We can make lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m plan@@ s .
And he wan@@ ts to just have us do w@@ hatever makes sense to be doing right now .
S@@ ome@@ times they a@@ gre@@ e .
"But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are har@@ der and less ple@@ as@@ ant , for the sa@@ ke of the big picture ."
And that &apos;s when we have a con@@ fli@@ ct .
"And for the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ or , that con@@ fli@@ ct ten@@ ds to end a certain way every time , lea@@ ving him sp@@ en@@ ding a lot of time in this oran@@ ge z@@ one , an easy and f@@ un place that &apos;s enti@@ re@@ ly out of the M@@ ak@@ es S@@ en@@ se cir@@ cle ."
I call it the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ lay@@ ground .
"( Laughter ) Now , the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ lay@@ ground is a place that all of you pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ ors out there know very well ."
"And the question is , in this si@@ tu@@ ation , with the M@@ on@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ or ever get hi@@ m@@ self over here to this b@@ lue z@@ one , a less ple@@ as@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?"
"Now , he became very re@@ lev@@ ant in my life pretty re@@ cen@@ tly , because the people of TED re@@ ach@@ ed out to me about six months ago and in@@ vi@@ ted me to do a TED T@@ al@@ k ."
It &apos;s always been a dre@@ am of mine to have done a TED T@@ al@@ k in the past .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment , the R@@ a@@ tional De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er see@@ med to have something else on his mind ."
D@@ o we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to re@@ le@@ ase the spe@@ ak@@ ers ."
And gu@@ ess who w@@ ok@@ e up ?
"( Laughter ) So the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster star@@ ts los@@ ing his mind , and a few secon@@ ds later , the whole system &apos;s in may@@ hem . ( Laughter )"
"And this entire si@@ tu@@ ation , with the three charac@@ ters — this is the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ or &apos;s system ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to wr@@ ite about on the blo@@ g a couple of years ago .
"When I did , I was amaz@@ ed by the respon@@ se ."
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally thousands of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things ."
But what stru@@ ck me was the con@@ tr@@ ast between the light t@@ one of the p@@ ost and the he@@ av@@ in@@ ess of these e@@ ma@@ il@@ s .
"These people were wr@@ iting with in@@ ten@@ se f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion about what pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this M@@ on@@ key had done to them ."
"And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ or &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?"
Why are all of these people in such a dar@@ k place ?
"Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation ."
"So if you wanted a car@@ e@@ er where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter — something in the ar@@ ts , something en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ u@@ ri@@ al — there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get mo@@ men@@ tum , get things going ."
It &apos;s u@@ su@@ ally su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed qui@@ et@@ ly and pri@@ va@@ tely .
So I read these e@@ ma@@ il@@ s and I had a little bit of an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any — that I don &apos;t think non@@ -@@ pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ ors ex@@ ist .
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ at@@ ors .
"Now , you might not all be a me@@ ss , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a heal@@ thy relation@@ ship with de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , but remember : the M@@ on@@ key &apos;s s@@ ne@@ ak@@ i@@ est tri@@ ck is when the de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t there ."
"Now , I want to show you one last thing ."
I call this a Li@@ fe C@@ al@@ en@@ da@@ r .
That &apos;s one bo@@ x for every week of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"That &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally since we &apos;ve already used a bun@@ ch of those ."
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ en@@ da@@ r ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ating on something in life ."
We need to st@@ ay aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
"And because there &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today ."
"Well , maybe not today , but ..."
( Laughter ) You know .
S@@ ome@@ time so@@ on .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ tain W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ w@@ en@@ son who re@@ cen@@ tly was a@@ war@@ ded the con@@ gre@@ s@@ sion@@ al M@@ e@@ da@@ l of H@@ on@@ or for his ac@@ tions on S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"The c@@ olu@@ m@@ n came under am@@ bu@@ sh , and was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded on three si@@ des , and a@@ mon@@ g@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son was reco@@ gn@@ ized for run@@ ning into live fir@@ e to res@@ cu@@ e the w@@ oun@@ ded and pul@@ l out the de@@ ad ."
"One of the people he res@@ cu@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ a@@ c he@@ li@@ cop@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mark@@ able about this day is , by sh@@ e@@ er co@@ in@@ ci@@ den@@ ce , one of the me@@ dev@@ a@@ c medi@@ cs happened to have a G@@ o@@ P@@ r@@ o ca@@ mera on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole s@@ cen@@ e on ca@@ mera ."
It sho@@ ws C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de br@@ in@@ ging this w@@ oun@@ ded sol@@ di@@ er who had rece@@ i@@ ved a g@@ un@@ sho@@ t to the ne@@ ck .
"They put him in the he@@ li@@ cop@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son ben@@ d over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he turns around to res@@ cu@@ e more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep emo@@ tion , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the mili@@ tar@@ y , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are wil@@ ling to sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce themselves so that others may ga@@ in ."
"In business , we give bon@@ uses to people who are wil@@ ling to sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce others so that we may ga@@ in ."
We have it bac@@ k@@ wards . R@@ ight ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my in@@ iti@@ al con@@ clu@@ sion was that they &apos;re just better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re at@@ tra@@ cted to the mili@@ tar@@ y .
These better people are at@@ tra@@ cted to this con@@ cept of ser@@ vice .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these re@@ mark@@ able things , and more imp@@ or@@ tan@@ tly , others have that cap@@ ac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great hon@@ or of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to sa@@ ve others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this de@@ ep sense of tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation .
So tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation are really important here .
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ st me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply in@@ stru@@ ct two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a fe@@ eling .
So where does that fe@@ eling come from ?
"If you go back 5@@ 0,000 years to the P@@ al@@ e@@ oli@@ th@@ ic er@@ a , to the early days of H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ en@@ s , what we find is that the world was fil@@ led with dan@@ ger , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to k@@ ill us ."
No@@ thing person@@ al .
"W@@ he@@ ther it was the we@@ a@@ ther , la@@ ck of resour@@ ces , maybe a sa@@ ber@@ -@@ to@@ o@@ the@@ d ti@@ ger , all of these things working to re@@ du@@ ce our li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
"And so we ev@@ olved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ f@@ ety , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we bel@@ on@@ ged ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe a@@ mon@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ her@@ ent ben@@ ef@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at night and tru@@ st that someone from within my tri@@ be will wat@@ ch for dan@@ ger .
"If we don &apos;t tru@@ st each other , if I don &apos;t tru@@ st you , that means you won &apos;t wat@@ ch for dan@@ ger ."
B@@ ad system of survi@@ v@@ al .
The modern day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is fil@@ led with dan@@ ger , things that are trying to f@@ ru@@ stra@@ te our lives or re@@ du@@ ce our suc@@ cess , re@@ du@@ ce our opport@@ unity for suc@@ cess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns in the economy , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of the sto@@ ck market ."
It could be a new technology that ren@@ ders your business model ob@@ sol@@ ete over@@ night .
O@@ r it could be your com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion that is sometimes trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very min@@ im@@ um is working hard to f@@ ru@@ stra@@ te your growth and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"These are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The most comple@@ x problems in our time can be sol@@ ved with simple tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , if we are able to dre@@ am ."
"As a child , I disco@@ vered that crea@@ tivity is the key to c@@ ross from dre@@ a@@ ms to reality ."
"I learned this from my gran@@ d@@ mother , D@@ r. R@@ u@@ th T@@ ic@@ ha@@ u@@ er , a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e that se@@ tt@@ led in the heart of the An@@ des ."
"So part of my education inclu@@ ded help@@ ing her in re@@ m@@ ote , indi@@ gen@@ ous communi@@ ties ."
"I ch@@ er@@ ish those me@@ mor@@ ies , because they help@@ ed me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possi@@ bili@@ ties , without bar@@ ri@@ ers , as language or culture ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing those tri@@ ps , my gran@@ d@@ mother used to re@@ c@@ ite a K@@ ip@@ ling po@@ e@@ m : &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ thing hi@@ d@@ den . G@@ o and find it ."
G@@ o and look behind the M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
S@@ ome@@ thing lost behind the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
"L@@ ost and wa@@ iting for you . G@@ o ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medi@@ cal stu@@ dent ."
One of every hun@@ d@@ red children born wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can sol@@ ve — the part of this problem I have sp@@ ent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy .
The f@@ et@@ us needs to survi@@ ve inside the mother .
S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al de@@ pen@@ ds on communi@@ cation between the syste@@ mic and the pul@@ mon@@ ary blo@@ od .
"A@@ t the moment of bir@@ th , this communi@@ cation needs to stop ."
"If it doesn &apos;t close , the bab@@ y has a h@@ ole in the heart ."
It is ca@@ used by pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ity and gene@@ tic con@@ di@@ tions .
But what we know today is that a la@@ ck of o@@ x@@ y@@ gen is also one of the ca@@ uses .
"As you can see in the ch@@ art , the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy of this kind of h@@ ole dra@@ ma@@ tically incre@@ ases with al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de ."
"@@ Video : ( B@@ ab@@ y c@@ r@@ ying ) Wh@@ en you look at pati@@ ents with this con@@ di@@ tion , they see@@ m des@@ per@@ ate to bre@@ a@@ the ."
"T@@ o close the h@@ ole , maj@@ or sur@@ ger@@ y used to be the only solu@@ tion ."
"One night , my friend M@@ al@@ te , were ca@@ mp@@ ing in the A@@ maz@@ on regi@@ on ."
The only thing that would not bur@@ n in the fir@@ e was a gre@@ en av@@ o@@ ca@@ do b@@ ran@@ ch .
Th@@ en came a moment of in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion .
So we used the b@@ ran@@ ch as a m@@ old for our first inven@@ tion .
The hol@@ es in children &apos;s he@@ ar@@ ts can be clos@@ ed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of w@@ ire wr@@ app@@ ed on@@ to itself .
"In this video , we can see how a very tin@@ y ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart ."
The co@@ il then clos@@ es the h@@ ole .
"A@@ f@@ ter that moment of in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion , there came a very long time of ef@@ for@@ t develop@@ ing a prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ."
In v@@ it@@ r@@ o and in vi@@ v@@ o stu@@ dies took thousands of hours of work in the la@@ b .
"The co@@ il , if it works , can sa@@ ve lives ."
"I re@@ turned from Ger@@ many to B@@ oli@@ vi@@ a , thinking that wh@@ er@@ ever we go , we have the opport@@ unity to make a difference ."
"W@@ ith my wi@@ fe and part@@ ner , D@@ r. A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ d@@ ra He@@ ath , we started to see pati@@ ents ."
"A@@ f@@ ter suc@@ cess@@ ful@@ ly tre@@ ating pati@@ ents with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic ."
"But we live in a place that is 1@@ 2@@ ,000 feet high ."
"And , the pati@@ ents there need a speci@@ al de@@ vice to sol@@ ve their heart con@@ di@@ tion ."
The first co@@ il could suc@@ cess@@ ful@@ ly tre@@ at only half of the pati@@ ents in B@@ oli@@ vi@@ a .
The search started again .
We went back to the dra@@ wing bo@@ ard .
"A@@ f@@ ter many tri@@ als , and with the help of my gran@@ d@@ mother &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous friends in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , we ob@@ ta@@ ined a new de@@ vice ."
"For cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es , indi@@ gen@@ ous women told stories by we@@ a@@ ving comple@@ x patter@@ ns on lo@@ o@@ ms , and an un@@ expe@@ cted sk@@ ill help@@ ed us for the new de@@ vice ."
We take this tradi@@ tional me@@ th@@ od of we@@ a@@ ving and make a design made by a smar@@ t materi@@ al that recor@@ ds shap@@ e .
"It see@@ ms this time , the we@@ a@@ ving allo@@ ws us to create a se@@ am@@ less de@@ vice that doesn &apos;t ru@@ st because it &apos;s made of only one piece ."
It can change by itself into very comple@@ x stru@@ c@@ tures by a pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re that took deca@@ des to devel@@ op .
"As you can see , the de@@ vice en@@ ters the body through the natural chan@@ ne@@ ls ."
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the h@@ ole .
"O@@ ur de@@ vice exp@@ an@@ ds , places itself and clos@@ es the h@@ ole ."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open sur@@ ger@@ y was ne@@ cess@@ ary .
"( Applause ) A@@ s do@@ c@@ tors , we fi@@ ght with dise@@ ases that take a long time and ef@@ for@@ t to he@@ al — if they do ."
"This is the child from before , after the pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re ."
"As you can see — ( Applause ) A@@ s you can see , once the de@@ vice is in place , the pati@@ ent is 100 percent heal@@ ed ."
"F@@ rom start to fin@@ ish , the whole pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re takes only 30 minutes ."
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medi@@ cal and human point of view .
"We are so p@@ rou@@ d that some of our for@@ mer pati@@ ents are part of our team — a team , th@@ an@@ ks to ad@@ ded close inter@@ action with pati@@ ents that work with us ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we have only one idea : the best solu@@ tions need to be simple ."
We lost the fe@@ ar of cre@@ ating something new .
"The pat@@ h , it &apos;s not easy ."
M@@ any ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ar@@ ise all the time .
But we rece@@ ive st@@ ren@@ g@@ th from our pati@@ ents .
Th@@ e@@ ir resi@@ li@@ ence and cou@@ ra@@ ge in@@ sp@@ ire our crea@@ tivity .
"O@@ ur go@@ al is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or ac@@ cess ."
So we have to start a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion with a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one model .
We will give one de@@ vice for free to make sure that every child is tre@@ ated .
"We are in many countries now , but we need to be every@@ where ."
"This whole thing began with one im@@ possible idea as will contin@@ ue it , really : No child is left behind ."
M@@ uc@@ has gra@@ ci@@ as .
( Applause )
"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , on the bor@@ der of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o and M@@ p@@ um@@ alan@@ g@@ a , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ e@@ te@@ ma ."
"W@@ at@@ er and electri@@ city supp@@ ly are as un@@ predi@@ c@@ table as the we@@ a@@ ther , and gro@@ wing up in these t@@ ough si@@ tu@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rela@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of mine in win@@ ter , and we were sun@@ ba@@ thing ."
The L@@ imp@@ op@@ o sun gets really ho@@ t in win@@ ter .
"So as we were sun@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would bu@@ y that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sho@@ c@@ king sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per ac@@ cess to water and san@@ it@@ ation .
"F@@ our hun@@ d@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ outh Africa ."
"@@ V@@ ar@@ i@@ ous dise@@ ases th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most dr@@ as@@ tic of which is called tra@@ cho@@ ma ."
T@@ ra@@ cho@@ ma is an in@@ fe@@ ction of the eye du@@ e to dir@@ t getting into your eye . M@@ ulti@@ ple in@@ fe@@ ctions of tra@@ cho@@ ma can leave you per@@ man@@ ently b@@ l@@ ind .
"The disease lea@@ ves e@@ ight million people per@@ man@@ ently b@@ l@@ ind each and every year . The sho@@ c@@ king part about it is that to av@@ o@@ id being in@@ fe@@ cted with tra@@ cho@@ ma , all you have to do is was@@ h your face : no medi@@ cine , no p@@ il@@ ls , no in@@ je@@ ctions ."
"So after seeing these sho@@ c@@ king sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ st@@ y little ste@@ ed , my N@@ ok@@ ia 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a l@@ ap@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , ex@@ cept for the 20@@ -@@ ran@@ d-@@ an@@ -@@ h@@ our Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia , on Google , about lo@@ tions , crea@@ ms , the comp@@ os@@ i@@ tions , the me@@ l@@ ting poin@@ ts , the to@@ x@@ ici@@ ties — I did high school science — and I wr@@ ote down a little for@@ m@@ ul@@ a on a piece of p@@ aper ,"
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C speci@@ al sp@@ ice , you know ?"
"So I was like , o@@ kay , so we &apos;ve got the for@@ m@@ ul@@ a ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into pra@@ cti@@ ce .
"F@@ ast for@@ ward four years later , after having wr@@ it@@ ten a 4@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge business pla@@ n on the cell phone , having wr@@ it@@ ten my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ gest pat@@ en@@ t-@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had inven@@ ted D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first ba@@ th@@ -@@ sub@@ stitu@@ ting lo@@ tion ."
"You liter@@ ally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the li@@ mi@@ ted resour@@ ces I had , I went to uni@@ versity , met a few people , got it into pra@@ cti@@ ce , and we have a ful@@ ly fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing produ@@ ct that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble on the market ."
So we learned a few le@@ s@@ son@@ s in com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al@@ iz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble .
One of the things we learned was that po@@ or communi@@ ties don &apos;t bu@@ y produ@@ cts in bul@@ k .
"They bu@@ y produ@@ cts on de@@ m@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t bu@@ y a bo@@ x of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes . They bu@@ y one ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te each day , even though it &apos;s more ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
So we p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ged D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these inno@@ va@@ tive little sa@@ ch@@ ets .
"You just s@@ na@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the co@@ ol part is , one sa@@ ch@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ tes one bat@@ h for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting the produ@@ ct ."
We realized that even ri@@ ch kids from the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s really want D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"An@@ y@@ way , we realized that we could sa@@ ve 80 million li@@ ters of water on a@@ verage each time they s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed a bat@@ h , and also we would sa@@ ve two hours a day for kids who are in ru@@ ral are@@ as , two hours more for school , two hours more for ho@@ me@@ work , two hours more to just be a k@@ id ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key value pro@@ posi@@ tion , which was cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence ."
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a ri@@ ch man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence and a po@@ or man &apos;s li@@ fe@@ sa@@ ver .
"H@@ a@@ ving put the produ@@ ct into pra@@ cti@@ ce , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produ@@ ct on@@ to a m@@ ul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional to take it to the re@@ ta@@ il market , and one question I have for the audi@@ ence today is , on the gra@@ vel ro@@ ads of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , with an allo@@ wan@@ ce of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s st@@ opp@@ ing you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot throu@@ gh@@ out this whole process , last year Google na@@ med me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also cur@@ ren@@ tly the best stu@@ dent en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur in the world , the first Afri@@ can to get that ac@@ co@@ la@@ de , and one thing that really p@@ uz@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"F@@ ive years ago , I was on a sa@@ b@@ ba@@ tical , and I re@@ turned to the medi@@ cal uni@@ versity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real pati@@ ents and I wor@@ e the wh@@ ite co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant ."
There were two things that surpri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I sp@@ ent .
"The first one was that the common the@@ me of the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sions we had were h@@ osp@@ ital bu@@ d@@ gets and cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that sever@@ al of the col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es I met , for@@ mer friends from medi@@ cal school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted , en@@ ga@@ ged and pas@@ sion@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ ni@@ cal , di@@ sen@@ ga@@ ged , or had di@@ stan@@ ced themselves from h@@ osp@@ ital man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment ."
"So with this focu@@ s on cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the pati@@ ent ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ present and where I come from stru@@ g@@ gle with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ for@@ ms a@@ im at hol@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long wa@@ iting times for pati@@ ents for sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach pati@@ ents ."
"In sever@@ al countries , do@@ c@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the cos@@ tly deci@@ sions in health care are taken by do@@ c@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an ex@@ pen@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and fra@@ il pati@@ ent ."
"So , by lim@@ iting the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom of physi@@ ci@@ ans , this is a way to h@@ old cos@@ ts down ."
"And ulti@@ ma@@ tely , some physi@@ ci@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their pati@@ ents ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es are f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted .
"A@@ t B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ a@@ ging heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to ac@@ hi@@ eve ? &quot;"
"U@@ l@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at im@@ pro@@ ving health for the pati@@ ents , and we need to do so at a li@@ mi@@ ted , or af@@ for@@ da@@ ble , cost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by value : out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents rela@@ tive to the money we spend ."
This was des@@ cri@@ bed beauti@@ ful@@ ly in a book in 200@@ 6 by M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ za@@ be@@ th Te@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by his three beautiful da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the cos@@ ts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fas@@ cin@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are h@@ osp@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extre@@ me@@ ly good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are v@@ as@@ tly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ ma@@ tic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ ff@@ ers from pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"Now living in Euro@@ pe , he can cho@@ ose to go to Ger@@ many that has a wel@@ l-@@ re@@ pu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the a@@ verage h@@ osp@@ ital , he will have the risk of be@@ coming in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start we@@ aring di@@ ap@@ ers again ."
You fli@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ if@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to Ha@@ mb@@ ur@@ g , and to a c@@ lin@@ ic called the Mar@@ tin@@ i@@ -@@ K@@ lin@@ ik , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ ither you a fli@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many h@@ osp@@ it@@ als for many different dise@@ ases , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
No@@ body kno@@ ws .
So going the h@@ osp@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the late &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ w@@ edi@@ sh or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ n@@ ual me@@ et@@ ing , and they were dis@@ cu@@ ss@@ ing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"T@@ o the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ ety of met@@ al pi@@ e@@ ces , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My tech@@ ni@@ que is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to meas@@ ure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact sp@@ ent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should meas@@ ure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should meas@@ ure that . &quot;"
And they finally a@@ gre@@ ed .
"And once they had a@@ gre@@ ed , they started meas@@ ur@@ ing , and started sh@@ aring the data ."
"@@ V@@ er@@ y quickly , they found that if you put ce@@ ment in the b@@ one of the pati@@ ent before you put the met@@ al s@@ haf@@ t in , it actually la@@ s@@ ted a lot longer , and most pati@@ ents would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ for@@ med c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal pra@@ cti@@ ce in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ ince then , they publi@@ sh every year ."
"On@@ ce a year , they publi@@ sh the lea@@ gue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ to@@ m ?"
"And they vi@@ sit each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of im@@ pro@@ vement ."
"For many years , S@@ w@@ edi@@ sh hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best res@@ ul@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were meas@@ ur@@ ing , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really ex@@ c@@ iting .
"So the physi@@ ci@@ ans get together , they a@@ gre@@ e on what qu@@ ality is , they start meas@@ ur@@ ing , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous im@@ pro@@ vement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only ex@@ c@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s ex@@ c@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focu@@ sed on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the lo@@ we@@ st cos@@ ts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ p@@ ose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they comp@@ ared the U.@@ S@@ . and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many pati@@ ents have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ ger@@ y .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
"So many un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ary sur@@ ger@@ ies , and so much un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ary su@@ ff@@ ering for all the pati@@ ents who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year peri@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sav@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the me@@ mber countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ ases , actually a qu@@ ality which is be@@ low the a@@ verage in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would focu@@ s a lot more on meas@@ ur@@ ing qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of a@@ verage O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 500 billion U.@@ S@@ . dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these num@@ bers are fan@@ tas@@ tic , and it &apos;s all lo@@ gi@@ cal , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a para@@ di@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would ar@@ gue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The a@@ gen@@ ts of change are the do@@ c@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my pra@@ cti@@ ce as a con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant , I me@@ et probably a hun@@ d@@ red or more than a hun@@ d@@ red do@@ c@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other h@@ osp@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care st@@ af@@ f every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they ac@@ hi@@ eve in terms of qu@@ ality for their pati@@ ents .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans are , like most of you in the audi@@ ence , very com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive ."
They were always best in cla@@ ss .
We were always best in cla@@ ss .
"And if somebody can show them that the res@@ ult they per@@ form for their pati@@ ents is no better than what others do , they will do w@@ hatever it takes to im@@ pro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physi@@ ci@@ ans have another charac@@ ter@@ isti@@ c .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er reco@@ g@@ ni@@ tion .
"If a car@@ di@@ ologi@@ st cal@@ ls another car@@ di@@ ologi@@ st in a comp@@ et@@ ing h@@ osp@@ ital and dis@@ cu@@ s@@ ses why that other h@@ osp@@ ital has so much better res@@ ul@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to im@@ pro@@ ve .
"So it is , by meas@@ ur@@ ing and cre@@ ating trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous im@@ pro@@ vement , which is what this sli@@ de sho@@ ws ."
"Now , you may say this is a ni@@ ce idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to meas@@ ure and comp@@ are what we ac@@ hi@@ eve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two ac@@ ade@@ mic in@@ stitu@@ tions , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at Har@@ var@@ d Bu@@ sin@@ ess S@@ ch@@ ool , and the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ s@@ ka In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has for@@ med something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ ne@@ e@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ ne@@ e@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
It stan@@ ds for the In@@ ter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for He@@ al@@ th O@@ ut@@ come M@@ eas@@ u@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re br@@ in@@ ging together le@@ ad@@ ing physi@@ ci@@ ans and pati@@ ents to dis@@ cu@@ ss , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we meas@@ ure , and to make those stan@@ dar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : cat@@ arac@@ ts , back pa@@ in , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for in@@ stance , heart at@@ tac@@ k , and pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will publi@@ sh their data in No@@ ve@@ mber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comp@@ aring app@@ les to app@@ les , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ex@@ t year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do e@@ ight dise@@ ases , the year after , 1@@ 6 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pla@@ n to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
Co@@ mp@@ are app@@ les to app@@ les . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ ive months ago , I led a work@@ sho@@ p at the lar@@ gest uni@@ versity h@@ osp@@ ital in Nor@@ ther@@ n Euro@@ pe ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to man@@ age my big in@@ stitu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a work@@ sho@@ p together with physi@@ ci@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other st@@ af@@ f , dis@@ cu@@ ss@@ ing le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children ."
"The group dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sed , how do we meas@@ ure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we meas@@ ure it better than we do ?
"We dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
"And we dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sed what are the cos@@ ts for these pati@@ ents , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ mous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m ."
"A@@ t the end of the me@@ et@@ ing , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ part@@ ment , he sto@@ od up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he ra@@ i@@ sed his hand , I for@@ got that — he ra@@ i@@ sed his hand , c@@ len@@ ched his fi@@ st , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you . T@@ o@@ day , we &apos;re finally dis@@ cu@@ ss@@ ing what this h@@ osp@@ ital does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y meas@@ ur@@ ing value in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only cos@@ ts but out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents , we will make st@@ af@@ f in h@@ osp@@ it@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solu@@ tion ."
"I believe meas@@ ur@@ ing value in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a re@@ v@@ olution , and I &apos;m con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that the f@@ oun@@ der of modern medi@@ cine , the Gre@@ ek H@@ ip@@ po@@ cra@@ tes , who always put the pati@@ ent at the cen@@ ter , he would sm@@ ile in his gra@@ ve ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
You get them to ac@@ hi@@ eve un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able things .
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually mat@@ ters most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess .
"And I wanted to try to be syste@@ ma@@ tic about it , av@@ o@@ id some of my in@@ st@@ in@@ cts and maybe mis@@ per@@ cep@@ tions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years ."
"I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been star@@ ting busin@@ es@@ ses since I was 12 years old when I s@@ old can@@ dy at the bu@@ s stop in j@@ uni@@ or high school , to high school , when I made so@@ lar energy dev@@ ices , to colle@@ ge , when I made l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers ."
"And when I gra@@ du@@ ated from colle@@ ge , I started so@@ f@@ tw@@ are companies ."
"And 20 years ago , I started I@@ de@@ ala@@ b , and in the last 20 years , we started more than 100 companies , many suc@@ ce@@ s@@ ses , and many big fa@@ il@@ u@@ res ."
We learned a lot from those fa@@ il@@ u@@ res .
So I looked at these five .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
I na@@ med my company I@@ de@@ ala@@ b for how much I wor@@ ship the &quot; &quot; a@@ ha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the ex@@ ecu@@ tion , ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ bility , that mat@@ ter@@ ed even more than the idea ."
That started ris@@ ing to the top in my thinking about maybe what mat@@ ter@@ ed most for suc@@ cess .
Th@@ en I looked at the fun@@ ding .
S@@ ome@@ times companies rece@@ i@@ ved in@@ ten@@ se amoun@@ ts of fun@@ ding .
M@@ ay@@ be that &apos;s the most important thing ?
"And then of course , the ti@@ ming ."
I@@ s the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
"I &apos;d done well at school . E@@ x@@ pe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly en@@ ter@@ ed the stu@@ dent life of le@@ c@@ tures , par@@ ties and tra@@ f@@ fic c@@ one the@@ ft ."
"U@@ n@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually de@@ ep@@ ly un@@ happy , in@@ se@@ c@@ ure and fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fa@@ il@@ ure and of the emp@@ tin@@ ess that I felt was within me ."
"I was lea@@ ving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , h@@ um@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ b@@ ling with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hun@@ d@@ red times before , when su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is lea@@ ving the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the c@@ lar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mi@@ st@@ ak@@ able ."
&quot; She is open@@ ing the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The vo@@ ice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice per@@ si@@ s@@ ted , days and then we@@ eks of it , on and on , n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ting everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a le@@ cture . &quot;
"It was ne@@ u@@ tra@@ l , imp@@ as@@ sive and even , after a while , st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did no@@ ti@@ ce that its cal@@ m ex@@ teri@@ or sometimes sli@@ pp@@ ed and that it oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally mi@@ r@@ r@@ or@@ ed my own un@@ ex@@ pres@@ sed emo@@ tion ."
"So , for example , if I was an@@ gr@@ y and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very ade@@ pt at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted ."
"A sub@@ tle con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing process had be@@ g@@ un , the imp@@ li@@ cation that normal people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very ser@@ i@@ ously wrong ."
I sp@@ ent some time telling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fa@@ ir , I was des@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my st@@ range com@@ men@@ tat@@ or ."
"For example , I was part of a stu@@ dent T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news bul@@ le@@ tin@@ s around the ca@@ mp@@ us , and during an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment which was run@@ ning very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , do@@ ctor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to rap@@ id@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A h@@ osp@@ ital ad@@ mis@@ sion fol@@ lo@@ wed , the first of many , a dia@@ gn@@ os@@ is of s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , tor@@ men@@ ting sense of hop@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness , hu@@ mili@@ ation and de@@ sp@@ air about myself and my pr@@ os@@ pe@@ cts ."
"But having been en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m , my fe@@ ar and resi@@ stance to@@ wards it in@@ ten@@ si@@ fied ."
"Now essen@@ ti@@ ally , this re@@ presen@@ ted taking an ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive stance to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of p@@ sy@@ chi@@ c ci@@ vi@@ l war , and in turn this ca@@ used the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that gla@@ ss of water ?
"In effe@@ ct , a v@@ ici@@ ous cy@@ cle of fe@@ ar , av@@ o@@ id@@ ance , mi@@ stru@@ st and mis@@ under@@ standing had been est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , and this was a bat@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"T@@ w@@ o years later , and the de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole f@@ ren@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ ire : ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que vi@@ sions , biz@@ ar@@ re , in@@ tra@@ c@@ table de@@ lu@@ sions ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ re@@ c@@ ka@@ ge and de@@ sp@@ air of those years , it see@@ ms to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sa@@ ved ."
"A bro@@ ken and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who emer@@ ged was a survi@@ v@@ or and would ulti@@ ma@@ tely grow into the person I was de@@ st@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the me@@ mor@@ ies grow p@@ al@@ e and fa@@ int in comp@@ ar@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve help@@ ed me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as late as M@@ ay , but su@@ m@@ mer always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to ful@@ ly cre@@ di@@ t those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ou@@ ght with me and for me and who wa@@ i@@ ted to wel@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ ized , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ ared so h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this re@@ spe@@ ct , a v@@ ital first step was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a met@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ ices which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to at@@ tac@@ k my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fe@@ ar and in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity in the world , rather than an ac@@ tual , obje@@ ctive dan@@ ger ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , si@@ tting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prote@@ ct them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t me@@ ss with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a pla@@ stic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ te@@ gi@@ c ."

I &apos;m here to share my photo@@ graph@@ y .
O@@ r is it photo@@ graph@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photo@@ grap@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your ca@@ mera ."
"Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photo@@ graph@@ y started as I got my first di@@ git@@ al ca@@ mera at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pas@@ sion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the ca@@ mera , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photo@@ grap@@ h with a ca@@ mera , the process ends when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photo@@ graph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
P@@ h@@ oto@@ s like this : con@@ stru@@ ction going on along a bu@@ s@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ expe@@ cted tw@@ ist .
"And de@@ sp@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of real@@ ism ."
"O@@ r photo@@ s like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of real@@ ism ."
"When I say real@@ ism , I mean photo@@ -@@ real@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photo@@ grap@@ h ."
P@@ h@@ oto@@ s where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look real@@ isti@@ c ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What crea@@ tes the il@@ lu@@ sion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the per@@ spe@@ ctive is the il@@ lu@@ sion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a tw@@ o-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al surface ."
"It &apos;s not really what is real@@ isti@@ c , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ isti@@ c really ."
So I think the bas@@ ic@@ s are quite simple .
I just see it as a p@@ uz@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different pi@@ e@@ ces of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"H@@ ere we have three per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly ima@@ gin@@ able physi@@ cal obje@@ cts , something we all can rela@@ te to living in a thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al world ."
"But com@@ bin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ bin@@ ing photo@@ graph@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ bin@@ ing different re@@ ali@@ ties .
"So the things that make a photo@@ grap@@ h look real@@ isti@@ c , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our da@@ ily lives ."
"But when com@@ bin@@ ing photo@@ graph@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple ru@@ les to fol@@ low to ac@@ hi@@ eve a real@@ isti@@ c res@@ ult .
"As you can see , these ima@@ ges ar@@ en &apos;t really speci@@ al ."
"But com@@ bin@@ ed , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that photo@@ s com@@ bin@@ ed should have the same per@@ spe@@ ctive .
"S@@ econ@@ dly , photo@@ s com@@ bin@@ ed should have the same ty@@ pe of light ."
And these two ima@@ ges both ful@@ f@@ ill these two re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments — sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same ty@@ pe of light .
The third one is about making it im@@ possible to di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ ish where the different ima@@ ges be@@ gin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it im@@ possible to say how the image actually was comp@@ os@@ ed .
"So by mat@@ ching col@@ or , con@@ tr@@ ast and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different ima@@ ges , ad@@ ding photo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c de@@ fe@@ cts like de@@ p@@ th of field , de@@ sa@@ tu@@ ra@@ ted col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different ima@@ ges and make it look like one single image , de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundre@@ ds of la@@ yer@@ s basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ted .
But this image is actually enti@@ re@@ ly comp@@ os@@ ed of photo@@ graph@@ s from different lo@@ ca@@ tions .
"I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se with the ideas in your head ."
But it does re@@ qu@@ ire a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had sever@@ al months to pla@@ n it , to find the different lo@@ ca@@ tions for the pi@@ e@@ ces of the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a f@@ ish@@ ing tri@@ p ."
The sh@@ or@@ es are from a different lo@@ cation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ w@@ edi@@ sh ."
"So to ac@@ hi@@ eve a real@@ isti@@ c res@@ ult , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ket@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ bin@@ ing the different photo@@ graph@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the photo@@ s , the res@@ ult can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ isti@@ c ."
"So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our ima@@ gin@@ ation ."
Thank you .

The re@@ le@@ ase of these p@@ ap@@ ers from P@@ an@@ ama li@@ f@@ ts the ve@@ il on a tin@@ y piece of the se@@ cre@@ tive off@@ sh@@ ore world .
"We get an in@@ si@@ ght into how cli@@ ents and ban@@ ks and la@@ w@@ yer@@ s go to companies like M@@ os@@ sa@@ ck F@@ on@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; &quot; OK , we want an an@@ on@@ y@@ mous company , can you give us one ? &quot; &quot; So you actually get to see the e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , you get to see the ex@@ changes of messa@@ ges , you get to see the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s of how this works , how this oper@@ a@@ tes ."
"Now , this has already started to have pretty im@@ medi@@ ate re@@ per@@ cu@@ s@@ sions ."
The P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister of I@@ ce@@ land has re@@ sig@@ ned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the b@@ ru@@ tal S@@ y@@ ri@@ an di@@ c@@ tat@@ or B@@ as@@ ha@@ r Al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d has also got off@@ sh@@ ore companies .
"There &apos;s been al@@ le@@ ga@@ tions of a $ 2 billion money tra@@ il that lea@@ ds back to P@@ resi@@ dent V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r P@@ u@@ tin of R@@ us@@ si@@ a vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od friend , who happens to be a top cel@@ li@@ st ."
And there will be a lot of ri@@ ch individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ v@@ ous about the next set of stories and the next set of le@@ ak@@ ed do@@ cu@@ ments .
"Now , this s@@ ounds like the p@@ lot of a sp@@ y th@@ r@@ il@@ ler or a Joh@@ n G@@ ris@@ ham no@@ vel ."
"It see@@ ms very di@@ st@@ ant from you , me , ordin@@ ary people ."
Why should we care about this ?
"But the tru@@ th is that if ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als are able to keep their money off@@ sh@@ ore and not pay the ta@@ x@@ es that they should , it means that there is less money for v@@ ital public serv@@ ices like heal@@ th@@ care , education , ro@@ ads ."
And that af@@ fe@@ cts all of us .
"Now , for my organiz@@ ation G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ al ."
We have the world &apos;s media and political lea@@ ders talking about how individu@@ als can use off@@ sh@@ ore se@@ cre@@ cy to hi@@ de and dis@@ gu@@ ise their as@@ se@@ ts — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a deca@@ de .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world ba@@ ff@@ ling and con@@ f@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ sh@@ ore world works ."
I like to think of it a bit like a R@@ us@@ si@@ an dol@@ l .
"So you can have one company st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , making it almost im@@ possible to really understand who is behind these stru@@ c@@ tures ."
"It can be very difficult for la@@ w en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment or ta@@ x au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ists , ci@@ vi@@ l society to really understand what &apos;s going on ."
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less co@@ verage of this issu@@ e in the United States .
"And that &apos;s perhaps because some pro@@ min@@ ent U@@ S people just ha@@ ven &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red in this ex@@ pos@@ é , in this s@@ can@@ da@@ l ."
"Now , that &apos;s not because there are no ri@@ ch Americ@@ ans who are st@@ as@@ h@@ ing their as@@ se@@ ts off@@ sh@@ ore ."
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ sh@@ ore works , M@@ os@@ sa@@ ck F@@ on@@ se@@ ca has fe@@ wer American cli@@ ents ."
"I think if we saw le@@ ak@@ s from the C@@ ay@@ man I@@ s@@ lan@@ ds or even from De@@ la@@ w@@ are or W@@ yo@@ ming or N@@ ev@@ ada , you would see many more cas@@ es and exa@@ mp@@ les lin@@ king back to Americ@@ ans ."
"In fact , in a number of U@@ S sta@@ tes you need less information , you need to provi@@ de less information to get a company than you do to get a li@@ br@@ ary car@@ d ."
That sort of se@@ cre@@ cy in America has allo@@ wed emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es of school di@@ stri@@ cts to ri@@ p off sch@@ o@@ ol@@ children .
It has allo@@ wed s@@ ca@@ m@@ mers to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able inve@@ stor@@ s .
This is the sort of behavi@@ or that af@@ fe@@ cts all of us .
"Now , at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in pra@@ cti@@ ce ."
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we s@@ ent in an under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ at@@ or to 1@@ 3 Man@@ ha@@ tt@@ an la@@ w fir@@ ms .
"O@@ ur inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ at@@ or posed as an Afri@@ can min@@ ister who wanted to move su@@ spe@@ ct fun@@ ds into the United States to bu@@ y a house , a yac@@ h@@ t , a j@@ et ."
"Now , what was tru@@ ly sho@@ c@@ king was that all but one of those la@@ w@@ yer@@ s provi@@ ded our inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ at@@ or with sug@@ ge@@ s@@ tions on how to move those su@@ spe@@ ct fun@@ ds ."
"These were all pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary me@@ et@@ ings , and n@@ one of the la@@ w@@ yer@@ s took us on as a cli@@ ent and of course no money mo@@ ved hands , but it really sho@@ ws the problem with the system ."
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individu@@ al cas@@ es .
This is not just about an individu@@ al la@@ w@@ yer who &apos;s sp@@ ok@@ en to our under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ at@@ or and provi@@ ded sug@@ ge@@ s@@ tions .
It &apos;s not just about a particular sen@@ i@@ or poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an who &apos;s been ca@@ u@@ ght up in a s@@ can@@ da@@ l .
"This is about how a system works , that en@@ tr@@ en@@ ches cor@@ rup@@ tion , ta@@ x ev@@ as@@ i@@ on , po@@ ver@@ ty and in@@ sta@@ bility ."
"And in order to tac@@ k@@ le this , we need to change the game ."
We need to change the ru@@ les of the game to make this sort of behavi@@ or har@@ der .
"This may see@@ m like do@@ om and g@@ lo@@ om , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als ."
"But as a natural op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , I do see that we are star@@ ting to get some change ."
"O@@ ver the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real p@@ us@@ h to@@ wards gre@@ at@@ er trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy when it comes to company ow@@ ner@@ ship ."
This issu@@ e was put on the political a@@ gen@@ da by the U@@ K P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister Da@@ vi@@ d C@@ a@@ mer@@ on at a big G@@ 8 S@@ um@@ mit that was hel@@ d in Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ re@@ land in 20@@ 1@@ 3 .
"And since then , the Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on is going to be cre@@ ating cen@@ tra@@ l regi@@ ster@@ s at a national level of who really ow@@ ns and con@@ tr@@ ols companies across Euro@@ pe ."
"One of the things that is sa@@ d is that , actually , the U@@ S is la@@ g@@ ging behind ."
"There &apos;s bi@@ parti@@ san le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation that had been in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced in the H@@ ouse and the S@@ en@@ ate , but it isn &apos;t making as much pro@@ gre@@ ss as we &apos;d like to see ."
"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ ama le@@ ak@@ s , this huge pe@@ ek into the off@@ sh@@ ore world , be used as a way of open@@ ing up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
We need ordin@@ ary people to get an@@ gr@@ y at the way in which people can hi@@ de their iden@@ ti@@ ty behind se@@ cre@@ t companies .
"We need business lea@@ ders to stand up and say , &quot; Se@@ cre@@ cy like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need political lea@@ ders to reco@@ gn@@ ize the problem , and to com@@ mit to chan@@ ging the la@@ w to open up this sort of se@@ cre@@ cy ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we can end the se@@ cre@@ cy that is cur@@ ren@@ tly allo@@ wing ta@@ x ev@@ as@@ i@@ on , cor@@ rup@@ tion , money la@@ under@@ ing to f@@ l@@ ou@@ ris@@ h ."
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Ju@@ li@@ an , wel@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ por@@ ted that W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s , your bab@@ y , has , in the last few years has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed more cla@@ s@@ si@@ fied do@@ cu@@ ments than the rest of the world &apos;s media com@@ bin@@ ed ."
C@@ an that possi@@ bly be true ?
"@@ Ju@@ li@@ an A@@ s@@ san@@ ge : Ye@@ ah , can it possi@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts is able to re@@ le@@ ase more of that ty@@ pe of information than the rest of the world pre@@ ss com@@ bin@@ ed .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people re@@ le@@ ase the do@@ cu@@ ments ?
And how do you se@@ c@@ ure their pri@@ vac@@ y ?
"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — cla@@ s@@ si@@ cal wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ w@@ ers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this sta@@ te@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ tion to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , pas@@ s it through le@@ g@@ al ju@@ ris@@ di@@ ctions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those le@@ g@@ al prote@@ ctions ."
"We get information in the ma@@ il , the re@@ gu@@ lar pos@@ tal ma@@ il , en@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted or not , vet it like a re@@ gu@@ lar news organiz@@ ation , forma@@ t it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant da@@ tab@@ ases of information — re@@ le@@ ase it to the public and then def@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able le@@ g@@ al and political at@@ tac@@ ks ."

"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you le@@ ak@@ ed a few years ago .
If we can have this do@@ cu@@ ment up ...
So this was a story in Ken@@ ya a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ rol@@ l R@@ ep@@ ort .
This was a se@@ cre@@ t in@@ telli@@ gen@@ ce re@@ p@@ ort com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed by the Ken@@ yan government after its ele@@ ction in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , Ken@@ ya was ru@@ led by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ara@@ p Mo@@ i for about 18 years ."
He was a so@@ ft di@@ c@@ tat@@ or of Ken@@ ya .
"And when K@@ i@@ bak@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ rup@@ tion in Ken@@ ya — they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed this re@@ p@@ ort , sp@@ ent about two million p@@ ounds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated re@@ p@@ ort ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for political le@@ verage on Mo@@ i , who was the ri@@ ch@@ est man — still is the ri@@ ch@@ est man — in Ken@@ ya ."
It &apos;s the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ ra@@ il of Ken@@ yan jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we man@@ a@@ ged to get h@@ old of this just pri@@ or to the ele@@ ction — the national ele@@ ction , D@@ ece@@ mber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed that re@@ p@@ ort , we did so three days after the new pre@@ si@@ dent , K@@ i@@ bak@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ara@@ p Mo@@ i , so this re@@ p@@ ort then became a de@@ ad al@@ bat@@ ross around P@@ resi@@ dent K@@ i@@ bak@@ i &apos;s ne@@ ck ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to cut a long story sh@@ ort — word of the re@@ p@@ ort le@@ ak@@ ed into Ken@@ ya , not from the off@@ ici@@ al media , but indi@@ re@@ c@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ i@@ on , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the ele@@ ction ."
"@@ J@@ A : Ye@@ ah . So this became front pa@@ ge of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding countries of Ken@@ ya , in Tan@@ z@@ an@@ ian and S@@ outh Afri@@ can pre@@ ss ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the Ken@@ yan pre@@ ss feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts stra@@ ight on Ken@@ yan T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a Ken@@ yan in@@ telli@@ gen@@ ce re@@ p@@ ort , which changed the res@@ ult of the ele@@ ction ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your le@@ ak really sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .

"G@@ od da@@ m@@ n it , K@@ yle . All right , ha@@ ha@@ ha . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was sev@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d to f@@ ur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three at@@ tac@@ ks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that s@@ cen@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that at@@ tac@@ k , right , inclu@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Ye@@ ah . T@@ w@@ o Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 18 and 2@@ 6 people kil@@ led all together .
CA : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this ca@@ used w@@ ide@@ sp@@ read ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key ele@@ ment of this that actually ca@@ used the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"

And there was two jour@@ n@@ al@@ ists inv@@ olved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ gen@@ ts because that &apos;s their ful@@ l-@@ time job .

"@@ J@@ A : We would have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Ye@@ ah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , Ara@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true human@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ uses in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at de@@ cla@@ s@@ si@@ fied c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of materi@@ al that &apos;s there ."
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y ?"
Why is it right to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge le@@ ak@@ ing of se@@ cre@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can ac@@ hi@@ eve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ en@@ ding economic ef@@ for@@ t into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ n@@ al that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ en@@ ding work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in pra@@ cti@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , e@@ ither to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or inde@@ ed to society at large , where le@@ ak@@ ing can actually have an un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation poli@@ cy ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of person@@ al — person@@ ally iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate se@@ cre@@ ts — you know , your recor@@ ds with your do@@ ctor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate se@@ cre@@ t — but we deal with wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ w@@ ers that are coming for@@ ward that are really sort of wel@@ l-@@ mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted ."
CA : So they are wel@@ l-@@ mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.@@ S@@ . mili@@ tar@@ y , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an in@@ cen@@ tive to put out ."
It sho@@ ws a U.@@ S@@ . sol@@ di@@ er la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pres@@ sion , has given the im@@ pres@@ sion , to mil@@ lions of people around the world that U.@@ S@@ . sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Ye@@ ah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ i@@ on . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ i@@ on of the people who are pay@@ ing for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
CA : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of dar@@ k se@@ cre@@ ts in companies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
"But do you see any ir@@ on@@ y in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create se@@ cre@@ cy around your sour@@ ces ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s dis@@ si@@ dents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sour@@ ces who are dis@@ si@@ dents on other sour@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come for@@ ward , that would be a tri@@ ck@@ y si@@ tu@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ el@@ led to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous as to the op@@ in@@ i@@ on in the TED audi@@ ence ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vie@@ ws of W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s and of Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ in@@ ging this important light ."
D@@ an@@ ger@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the dan@@ ger@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er view ?
"@@ J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft cro@@ w@@ d , Ju@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft cro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet le@@ ak@@ ed , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sa@@ mple of what we do sort of every day .
"So late last year — in No@@ ve@@ mber last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well blo@@ w@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well blo@@ w@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ p@@ ort — a sort of engine@@ ering anal@@ y@@ sis into what happened — saying that , in fact , se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , vari@@ ous comp@@ et@@ ing oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tru@@ cks there and blo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ ban@@ ian government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering re@@ p@@ ort had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extre@@ me@@ ly difficult do@@ cu@@ ment for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ if@@ y it because we didn &apos;t know who wr@@ ote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a comp@@ et@@ ing oil fir@@ m just sort of pla@@ ying the issu@@ e up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The materi@@ al looks good , it fe@@ els right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ if@@ y it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a let@@ ter just this week from the company who wr@@ ote it , wan@@ ting to tra@@ ck down the sour@@ ce — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tra@@ ck down the sour@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What do@@ cu@@ ment is it , pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had le@@ g@@ al au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over that do@@ cu@@ ment ?
I@@ s it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this scre@@ en sho@@ t with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Ye@@ ah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ if@@ ying , what a materi@@ al is , is to try and get these guys to wr@@ ite let@@ ters ."
CA : Ye@@ ah . Ha@@ ve you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Ye@@ ah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of ser@@ i@@ ous fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and engine@@ ering ef@@ for@@ t ."
So our publi@@ cation rate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ i@@ miz@@ ed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of gro@@ wing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ mous qu@@ anti@@ ty of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clos@@ u@@ res of a very high cal@@ i@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ ck , basically jour@@ n@@ al@@ isti@@ c v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fun@@ ding of jour@@ n@@ al@@ isti@@ c s@@ alar@@ ies ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Ye@@ ah , and tru@@ s@@ ted people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of materi@@ al we deal with , so we have to re@@ stru@@ cture in order to have people who will deal with the high@@ est national se@@ cur@@ ity stuff , and then lo@@ wer se@@ cur@@ ity cas@@ es ."
CA : So help us understand a bit about you person@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a k@@ id you went to 3@@ 7 different sch@@ o@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movi@@ e business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ bin@@ ation between the two ..."
"( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ st might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the movi@@ e business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a ha@@ ck@@ er at an early age and ran into the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st at an early age ."
"I wr@@ ote a ma@@ gaz@@ ine , was pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ a@@ ger ."
So you have to be car@@ e@@ ful with ha@@ ck@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be de@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ed for vari@@ ous things .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , at the moment , it &apos;s mos@@ tly de@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your gran@@ d@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ r@@ ase is not , not as ni@@ ce as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Ye@@ ah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s gran@@ d@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your cor@@ e val@@ u@@ es ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that help@@ ed de@@ ter@@ mine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the cor@@ e val@@ u@@ es : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Ye@@ ah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ ba@@ tive person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ pet@@ ra@@ tors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my charac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minu@@ te , the story : what happened in I@@ ce@@ land ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , ran into tr@@ ou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news ser@@ vice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ cted from run@@ ning the story ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , they publi@@ c@@ ized your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ prof@@ ile in I@@ ce@@ land . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Ye@@ ah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ ce@@ land went through this finan@@ cial cri@@ sis .
It was the har@@ de@@ st h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king se@@ ctor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the economy .
"An@@ y@@ way , so we re@@ le@@ ase this re@@ p@@ ort in Ju@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ j@@ un@@ cted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movi@@ e : in@@ j@@ un@@ ction lan@@ ded on the news des@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ site instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very fa@@ mous in I@@ ce@@ land , went to I@@ ce@@ land and sp@@ ok@@ e about this issu@@ e ."
"And there was a fe@@ eling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a res@@ ult , working with I@@ ce@@ lan@@ di@@ c poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and some other inter@@ national le@@ g@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge of le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation for I@@ ce@@ land to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the free pre@@ ss , with the st@@ ron@@ gest jour@@ n@@ al@@ isti@@ c prote@@ ctions in the world , with a new No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
"I@@ ce@@ land &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pas@@ sed by the I@@ ce@@ lan@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ a@@ ment un@@ anim@@ ously ."
CA : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more lik@@ ely to be Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more se@@ cre@@ cy , or us wat@@ ching Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be pla@@ y@@ ed for e@@ ither way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ mous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation and trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
W@@ hi@@ ch way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of ef@@ for@@ t , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fle@@ cting the audi@@ ence &apos;s op@@ in@@ i@@ on to say , Ju@@ li@@ an , be car@@ e@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ r@@ is . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )"
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ le@@ ss@@ ing as a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an ac@@ cess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I famili@@ ar with the 50 sta@@ tes in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vi@@ si@@ ted more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the Car@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l-@@ time progra@@ ms in 80 na@@ tions on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pre@@ si@@ dent , but we also me@@ et the vil@@ la@@ gers who live in the most re@@ m@@ ote are@@ as of Africa ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the Car@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pro@@ m@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ vo@@ cation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to be@@ gin with .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all is the mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of reli@@ gi@@ ous s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , hol@@ y s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , in the Bi@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ a@@ ment , New T@@ est@@ a@@ ment , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant posi@@ tions in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ches and in the mos@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these ru@@ les to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily re@@ le@@ ga@@ ted to a secon@@ d@@ ary posi@@ tion comp@@ ared to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very ser@@ i@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 2@@ 000 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st for 70 years — I tell you , I still te@@ ach S@@ un@@ day school every S@@ un@@ day ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ un@@ day as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st Con@@ ven@@ tion in the year 2@@ 000 decided that women should play a secon@@ d@@ ary posi@@ tion , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent posi@@ tion to men ."
"So they issu@@ ed an edi@@ ct , in effe@@ ct , that pre@@ ven@@ ts women from being pri@@ est@@ s , pas@@ tors , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or ch@@ ap@@ la@@ ins in the mili@@ tar@@ y , and if a woman teach@@ es a cla@@ ss@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st se@@ min@@ ary , they cannot te@@ ach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the Bi@@ ble , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the Bi@@ ble , that say that a woman sh@@ ouldn &apos;t te@@ ach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the bas@@ ic thing is the s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant posi@@ tion .
"That is an al@@ l-@@ per@@ v@@ as@@ ive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ yer , for in@@ stance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of God , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I pay them equ@@ al pay for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very ser@@ i@@ ous b@@ light that ca@@ uses this problem is the ex@@ ce@@ s@@ sive re@@ sort to viol@@ ence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for in@@ stance , we have had an en@@ or@@ mous incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of po@@ or people , mos@@ tly black people and min@@ ori@@ ties , by pu@@ tting them in pri@@ son ."
"When I was in of@@ fi@@ ce as govern@@ or of Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"N@@ o@@ wa@@ days , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase .
"And since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , there &apos;s been an 8@@ 00 percent incre@@ ase in the number of women who are black who are in pri@@ son ."
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death pen@@ al@@ ty that is a develop@@ ed country .
And we ran@@ k right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all ele@@ ments of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a now , and I fi@@ gu@@ red out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a has sp@@ ent four billion dollars in con@@ v@@ ic@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the death pen@@ al@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to sen@@ d a person to be ex@@ ecu@@ ted ."
"N@@ e@@ br@@ as@@ ka this week just pas@@ sed a la@@ w ab@@ oli@@ sh@@ ing the death pen@@ al@@ ty , because it cos@@ ts so much . ( Applause ) So the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and ab@@ use of po@@ or people and help@@ less people is another cause of the incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of women ."
"L@@ et me just go down a very few ab@@ uses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ ef , because I have a li@@ mi@@ ted amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation .
"G@@ en@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation is hor@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a gir@@ l , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely cut away by a so@@ -@@ called cu@@ t@@ ter who has a ra@@ zor bla@@ de and , in a non@@ -@@ ster@@ ili@@ z@@ ed way , they re@@ move the ex@@ teri@@ or parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a ."
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me cas@@ es but not very r@@ are cas@@ es , they se@@ w the ori@@ fi@@ ce up so the gir@@ l can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ stru@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets mar@@ ri@@ ed , the same cu@@ t@@ ter goes in and open@@ s the ori@@ fi@@ ce up so she can have se@@ x ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , for in@@ stance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ mal@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are cut that way before they re@@ ach ma@@ tur@@ ity ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble a@@ ff@@ li@@ ction on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very ser@@ i@@ ous thing is hon@@ or kil@@ lin@@ gs , where a family with mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation , again , of a hol@@ y s@@ cri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ ur@@ an that man@@ da@@ tes this — will ex@@ ecu@@ te a gir@@ l in their family if she is rap@@ ed or if she mar@@ ri@@ es a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she we@@ ars in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate c@@ lo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by me@@ mb@@ ers of her own family , so the family be@@ comes m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the gir@@ l br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ n anal@@ y@@ sis was done in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it sho@@ wed that 7@@ 5 percent of these m@@ ur@@ ders of a gir@@ l are per@@ pet@@ ra@@ ted by the father , the un@@ cle or the bro@@ ther , but 25 percent of the m@@ ur@@ ders are con@@ du@@ cted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rela@@ tes to women particu@@ lar@@ ly is sla@@ very , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ wa@@ days ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people s@@ old from Africa into sla@@ very in the New Wor@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in sla@@ very .
"The United States De@@ part@@ ment of S@@ t@@ ate now has a man@@ da@@ te from Con@@ gre@@ ss to give a re@@ p@@ ort every year , and the S@@ t@@ ate De@@ part@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are s@@ old across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into sla@@ very , and that 80 percent of those s@@ old are women , into se@@ x@@ ual sla@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human bon@@ da@@ ge , or sla@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the Car@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is lo@@ cated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ mor@@ y Uni@@ versity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people s@@ old into sla@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta has the bu@@ si@@ est air@@ p@@ ort in the world , and they also have a lot of pas@@ sen@@ gers that come from the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n He@@ mi@@ sp@@ here ."
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to bu@@ y a gir@@ l that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ ite@@ -@@ s@@ kin@@ ned gir@@ l br@@ ings sever@@ al times more than that , and the a@@ verage bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per sla@@ ve ."
"The se@@ x tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ eds the tot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"So this is another very ser@@ i@@ ous problem , and the bas@@ ic problem is pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ or@@ e@@ house in America that &apos;s not known by the local off@@ ici@@ als , the local poli@@ ce@@ men , or the chi@@ ef of poli@@ ce or the ma@@ yor and so for@@ th ."
"And this lea@@ ds to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ou@@ ght incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly and put into se@@ x@@ ual sla@@ very in all countries in the world ."
S@@ we@@ den has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ ted if they are in se@@ x@@ ual sla@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ners and the p@@ imp@@ s and the mal@@ e cu@@ sto@@ mers are pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite posi@@ tion ."
"For every mal@@ e ar@@ res@@ ted for il@@ le@@ g@@ al se@@ x tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ res@@ ted in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ ada , I@@ re@@ land , I &apos;ve already said S@@ we@@ den , Fran@@ ce , and other countries are moving now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ w@@ edi@@ sh model ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great in@@ stitu@@ tions in this country that all of us ad@@ mi@@ re : our mili@@ tar@@ y and our great uni@@ versity system .
"In the mili@@ tar@@ y , they are now anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing how many se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts take place ."
"The last re@@ p@@ ort I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts that took place in the mili@@ tar@@ y — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"On@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ ted , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding off@@ ic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a bat@@ tal@@ i@@ on in the Ar@@ my or a company in the Mar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ te a rap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
"A@@ b@@ out one out of four gir@@ ls who en@@ ter American uni@@ versi@@ ties will be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted before she gra@@ du@@ a@@ tes , and this is now getting a lot of publi@@ city , parti@@ ally because of my book , but other things , and so 8@@ 9 uni@@ versi@@ ties in America are now con@@ de@@ m@@ ned by the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ du@@ cation under T@@ it@@ le I@@ X because the off@@ ici@@ als of the uni@@ versi@@ ties are not taking care of the women to prote@@ ct them from se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ult ."
"The De@@ part@@ ment of J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce says that more than half of the rap@@ es on a colle@@ ge ca@@ mp@@ us take place by ser@@ i@@ al rap@@ ists , because outside of the uni@@ versity system , if they rap@@ e somebody , they &apos;ll be pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ ted , but when they get on a uni@@ versity ca@@ mp@@ us , they can rap@@ e with imp@@ unity ."
They &apos;re not pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ i@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls is the la@@ ck of equ@@ al pay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l-@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some pro@@ gre@@ ss , parti@@ ally because I was pre@@ si@@ dent and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no pro@@ gre@@ ss made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 500 companies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 500 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an a@@ verage than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been f@@ lying over@@ head dro@@ pp@@ ing bo@@ mb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dr@@ ones that at@@ tac@@ k people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t dro@@ p a bo@@ m@@ b , we didn &apos;t la@@ un@@ ch a mi@@ ss@@ ile , we didn &apos;t fir@@ e a bul@@ let ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and the mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of the hol@@ y s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ uses , are the bas@@ ic ca@@ uses , of ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a da@@ m@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The a@@ verage man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls qui@@ et@@ ly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged posi@@ tion that we oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y , and this is very si@@ mi@@ lar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had ex@@ is@@ ted ."
"R@@ ac@@ i@@ al dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , le@@ g@@ ally , had ex@@ is@@ ted for 100 years , from 18@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar B@@ et@@ we@@ en the States , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don Joh@@ n@@ son got the bil@@ ls pas@@ sed for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts ."
"But during that time , there were many wh@@ ite people that didn &apos;t think that ra@@ cial dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation was o@@ kay , but they st@@ ay@@ ed qui@@ et , because they en@@ j@@ oy@@ ed the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ges of better j@@ ob@@ s , uni@@ que ac@@ cess to j@@ ur@@ y du@@ ty , better sch@@ o@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that ex@@ ists today , because the a@@ verage man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged posi@@ tion ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ or@@ ity of men who control the uni@@ versity system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the mili@@ tar@@ y system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the govern@@ ments of the world , and the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the great reli@@ gi@@ ons ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful na@@ tions like this one , and where you come from , Euro@@ pe and so for@@ th , who have inf@@ lu@@ ence and who have fre@@ e@@ dom to spe@@ ak and to act , need to take the respon@@ si@@ bility on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to ra@@ cial dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women all over the world ."
The a@@ verage woman in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to de@@ ta@@ il about that .
"But I hope that out of this con@@ fer@@ ence , that every woman here will get your h@@ us@@ ban@@ ds to real@@ ize that these ab@@ uses on the colle@@ ge ca@@ mp@@ uses and the mili@@ tar@@ y and so for@@ th and in the future job market , need to prote@@ ct your da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters and your gran@@ d@@ da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters ."
"I have 12 gran@@ d@@ children , four children , and 10 gre@@ at@@ -@@ gran@@ d@@ children , and I think often about them and about the p@@ light that they will face in America , not only if they li@@ ved in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or a for@@ e@@ ig@@ n country , in having equ@@ al ri@@ ghts , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on for women and gir@@ ls around the world and prote@@ ct their human ri@@ ghts ."
Thank you very much .

"When I was a stu@@ dent here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , the future of the world was b@@ le@@ ak ."
The population exp@@ los@@ i@@ on was un@@ st@@ opp@@ able .
G@@ lob@@ al fa@@ mine was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
A cancer ep@@ ide@@ mic ca@@ used by chemi@@ cal@@ s in the environment was going to sh@@ or@@ ten our lives .
The ac@@ id ra@@ in was fal@@ ling on the for@@ est@@ s .
The de@@ ser@@ t was ad@@ van@@ cing by a m@@ ile or two a year .
"The oil was run@@ ning out , and a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar win@@ ter would fin@@ ish us off ."
"N@@ one of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly , if you look at what actually happened in my li@@ fe@@ time , the a@@ verage per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a in@@ come of the a@@ verage person on the planet , in real terms , ad@@ ju@@ s@@ ted for inf@@ lation , has tri@@ p@@ led ."
L@@ if@@ es@@ p@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ fe@@ time .
Ch@@ il@@ d mor@@ tal@@ ity is down by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds .
P@@ er@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a food produ@@ ction is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has d@@ ou@@ b@@ led .
"H@@ ow did we ac@@ hi@@ eve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we ac@@ hi@@ eve that ?
How did we become the only species that be@@ comes more pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous as it be@@ comes more pop@@ ul@@ ous ?
"The size of the blo@@ b in this grap@@ h re@@ presen@@ ts the size of the population , and the level of the grap@@ h re@@ presen@@ ts G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their bra@@ ins and en@@ able their ideas to com@@ b@@ ine and re@@ com@@ b@@ ine , to me@@ et and , inde@@ ed , to mate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have se@@ x ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making obje@@ cts like this to making obje@@ cts like this .
These are both real obje@@ cts .
One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ le@@ an hand a@@ x@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s .
The other is obvi@@ ously a computer m@@ ouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shap@@ e to an un@@ can@@ ny de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tried to work out which is big@@ ger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"They &apos;re both technologi@@ es . In the end , their si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just tel@@ ls you they were both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ var@@ ying design for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s made the same to@@ ol for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but to@@ ols changed s@@ lo@@ wer than s@@ ke@@ let@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no pro@@ gre@@ ss , no inno@@ v@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s an extra@@ ordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the obje@@ ct on the right is ob@@ sol@@ ete after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the obje@@ ct on the left is made from one sub@@ stance ."
"The obje@@ ct on the right is made from a con@@ fe@@ ction of different sub@@ stan@@ ces , from si@@ li@@ c@@ on and met@@ al and pla@@ stic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ fe@@ ction of different ideas , the idea of pla@@ stic , the idea of a la@@ s@@ er , the idea of tran@@ si@@ stor@@ s ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ bin@@ ed together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ bin@@ ation , this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the se@@ cre@@ t to under@@ standing what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"H@@ ow does ev@@ olution do cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive , com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it uses se@@ x@@ ual re@@ produ@@ ction ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ ual species , if you get two different mu@@ ta@@ tions in different cre@@ atu@@ res , a gre@@ en one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ tin@@ ct for the other to survi@@ ve .
"But if you have a se@@ x@@ ual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individu@@ al to in@@ her@@ it both mu@@ ta@@ tions from different lin@@ e@@ a@@ ges ."
So what se@@ x does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individu@@ al to dra@@ w up@@ on the gene@@ tic inno@@ va@@ tions of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effe@@ ct in cul@@ tu@@ ral ev@@ olution as se@@ x is having in bi@@ ological ev@@ olution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the ha@@ bit of ex@@ chan@@ ging one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ que human fe@@ ature .
No other anima@@ l does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the labor@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and inde@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one obje@@ ct for another never happens .
"As A@@ dam S@@ m@@ ith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fa@@ ir ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture ."
"C@@ hi@@ mp@@ an@@ ze@@ es , kil@@ ler wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of cre@@ atu@@ res , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other tradi@@ tions which are han@@ ded down from par@@ ent to off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing .
"In this case , chi@@ mp@@ an@@ ze@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cra@@ ck n@@ u@@ ts with ro@@ cks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never exp@@ and , never grow , never ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ late , never become com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
C@@ hi@@ mp@@ an@@ ze@@ e tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living stan@@ dar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from Da@@ vi@@ d R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a S@@ t@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ dam takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and a@@ x@@ es than A@@ dam .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ dam .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and a@@ x@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ dam make two a@@ x@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sa@@ ved an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ dam is going to get at making a@@ x@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the ga@@ ins from tra@@ de are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beau@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually crea@@ tes the mo@@ men@@ tum for more speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ation , which crea@@ tes the mo@@ men@@ tum for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ dam and O@@ z both sa@@ ved an h@@ our of time .
"That is pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity , the sa@@ ving of time in sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to provi@@ de for yourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this ev@@ en@@ ing to read a book by .
"If you had to start from s@@ cra@@ t@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You ren@@ der it down . You make a can@@ dle , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the a@@ verage w@@ age in B@@ rit@@ a@@ in today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ac@@ k in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for e@@ ight secon@@ ds on the a@@ verage w@@ age to ac@@ qu@@ ire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds of pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qu@@ ire another good or ser@@ vice ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the a@@ verage w@@ age ."
"B@@ ac@@ k in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a can@@ dle that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the a@@ verage person on the a@@ verage w@@ age could not af@@ for@@ d a can@@ dle in 18@@ 00 ."
"G@@ o back to this image of the a@@ x@@ e and the m@@ ouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one a@@ x@@ e was made by someone for hi@@ m@@ self ."
It was self-@@ su@@ ff@@ ici@@ en@@ cy .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the obje@@ ct on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ en@@ s ? H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds ? Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably mil@@ lions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was dr@@ il@@ ling for oil , which was going to be made into the pla@@ stic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a m@@ ouse for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed as a species .
"In the old days , if you were ri@@ ch , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be ri@@ ch ; you emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ les , or w@@ hatever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his din@@ ner every night .
"But a modern tou@@ ri@@ st going around the p@@ al@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his din@@ ner ton@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in bi@@ st@@ ro@@ s and ca@@ f@@ es and re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts and sh@@ op@@ s all over Par@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s no@@ ti@@ ce with an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w up@@ on speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living stan@@ dar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a cla@@ s@@ sic example ; work@@ ers work for qu@@ e@@ en@@ s and qu@@ e@@ en@@ s work for work@@ ers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produ@@ ctive di@@ vision of la@@ b@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ al@@ ize with re@@ spe@@ ct to re@@ produ@@ ction ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ si@@ st on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produ@@ ction ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in En@@ g@@ land , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produ@@ ction to the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ de@@ st ver@@ sion of this is probably the se@@ x@@ ual di@@ vision of la@@ b@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no ev@@ iden@@ ce for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work mal@@ e for fe@@ mal@@ e and fe@@ mal@@ e for mal@@ e .
"In all hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er soci@@ e@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ a@@ ging di@@ vision of la@@ b@@ or between , on the whole , hun@@ ting mal@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing fe@@ mal@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between speci@@ al@@ ized rol@@ es for mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it ben@@ ef@@ its both si@@ des .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ g@@ ging ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get ac@@ cess to prote@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tr@@ a ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sting hun@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ g@@ ging to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kil@@ ls a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both si@@ des ra@@ ise each other &apos;s stan@@ dar@@ ds of living through the se@@ x@@ ual di@@ vision of la@@ b@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ a@@ tive species .
They were a high@@ ly in@@ telli@@ g@@ ent species .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on a@@ verage , by the end , were big@@ ger than y@@ ours and mine in this room today ."
They were ima@@ gin@@ a@@ tive . They bu@@ ri@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disco@@ vered here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ isti@@ c s@@ kil@@ ls .
They were br@@ il@@ li@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no ev@@ iden@@ ce of a se@@ x@@ ual di@@ vision of la@@ b@@ or .
There &apos;s no ev@@ iden@@ ce of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavi@@ or by fe@@ mal@@ es .
It looks like the fe@@ mal@@ es were co@@ oper@@ a@@ tive hun@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no ev@@ iden@@ ce for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the obje@@ cts that you find in Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from local materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ au@@ cas@@ us there &apos;s a site where you find local Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from local ch@@ er@@ t .
"In the same val@@ ley there are modern human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same da@@ te , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from local ch@@ er@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings began moving obje@@ cts around like this , it was ev@@ iden@@ ce that they were ex@@ chan@@ ging between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
P@@ eople for@@ get that . P@@ eople think of tra@@ de as a modern thing .
E@@ x@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hun@@ d@@ red thou@@ s@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est ev@@ iden@@ ce for it cro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long di@@ stan@@ ces in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ as@@ hel@@ ls — as disco@@ vered by a team here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 1@@ 25 mi@@ les in@@ land from the M@@ edi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an in Al@@ ger@@ ia .
And that &apos;s ev@@ iden@@ ce that people have started ex@@ chan@@ ging between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ di@@ stance mo@@ vement means tra@@ de rather than mi@@ gra@@ tion ?
"Well , you look at modern hun@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ ori@@ gin@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed for st@@ one a@@ x@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ ka@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their neigh@@ bor@@ s for things like st@@ in@@ gra@@ y bar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ sequ@@ ence was that st@@ one a@@ x@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ di@@ stance mo@@ vement of to@@ ols is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not mi@@ gra@@ tion ."
"What happens when you cut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ al@@ ize ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down technologi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ verse ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
"When the se@@ a level r@@ ose and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia became an is@@ land 1@@ 0,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ en@@ ced s@@ lo@@ wer pro@@ gre@@ ss than people on the ma@@ in@@ land , they actually experi@@ en@@ ced re@@ gre@@ ss ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and f@@ ish@@ ing equ@@ ip@@ ment and c@@ lo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ in@@ tain the speci@@ al@@ ized s@@ kil@@ ls ne@@ cess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were p@@ lon@@ ked on a de@@ ser@@ t is@@ land .
"H@@ ow many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ket@@ s could we contin@@ ue to make after 1@@ 0,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ ra de@@ l F@@ u@@ e@@ go — si@@ mi@@ lar is@@ land , si@@ mi@@ lar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ ra de@@ l F@@ u@@ e@@ go is se@@ para@@ ted from S@@ outh America by a much n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer stra@@ ight , and there was tra@@ ding con@@ t@@ act across that stra@@ ight throu@@ gh@@ out 1@@ 0,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ ans were is@@ ola@@ ted .
"G@@ o back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one a@@ x@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse ?
"N@@ o@@ body , liter@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse .
I mean this quite ser@@ i@@ ously .
The pre@@ si@@ dent of the computer m@@ ouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a company .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dr@@ ill an oil well to get oil out to make pla@@ stic , and so on ."
"We all know little bi@@ ts , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fa@@ mous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the economi@@ st in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wr@@ ote about how a pen@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a pen@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to mine graph@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ ith language we have to trans@@ fer ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ yon@@ d our cap@@ a@@ bili@@ ties ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ yon@@ d the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an extra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interested in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
"What &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant to a society is how well people are comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the colle@@ ctive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the net@@ work .
We &apos;re the neur@@ ons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ et@@ ing and ma@@ ting of ideas between them , that is ca@@ using technologi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss , incre@@ men@@ t@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go for@@ ward , we will , of course , experience ter@@ ri@@ ble things ."
There will be w@@ ars ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolu@@ tely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the conne@@ ctions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will ad@@ van@@ ce , and ther@@ e@@ fore living stan@@ dar@@ ds will ad@@ van@@ ce ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ cing , through the bot@@ to@@ m@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the eli@@ tes but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and mate , we are su@@ re@@ ly ac@@ ce@@ ler@@ ating the rate of inno@@ v@@ ation ."
Thank you .

My name is A@@ mit .
"And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I p@@ it@@ ched this idea of doing something with mu@@ se@@ um@@ s and art to my b@@ os@@ s who &apos;s actually here , and she allo@@ wed me to do it ."
And it took 18 months .
"A lot of f@@ un , ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 1@@ 7 very interesting mu@@ se@@ um@@ s from n@@ ine countries ."
But I &apos;m going to focu@@ s on the de@@ m@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
"I think my person@@ al story is expla@@ ined very simply on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s ac@@ cess ."
And I gre@@ w up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not comp@@ la@@ ining — but I didn &apos;t have ac@@ cess to a lot of these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s and these art@@ works .
"And so when I started tra@@ v@@ eling and going to these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s , I started learning a lot ."
"And while working at Google , I tried to put this de@@ si@@ re to make it more ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sible with technology together ."
"So we for@@ med a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the de@@ m@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ un@@ ch .
"So , simple : you come to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Pro@@ je@@ c@@ t@@ .@@ com@@ ."
You look around at all these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s here .
"You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ izi , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ M@@ A , the Her@@ m@@ it@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh ."
"I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my fav@@ ori@@ tes , the M@@ et@@ ro@@ poli@@ tan Mu@@ se@@ um of Ar@@ t in New York ."
T@@ w@@ o ways of going in — very simple .

"It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ o@@ mb@@ ay , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , it doesn &apos;t really matter ."

K@@ e@@ ep going . Ha@@ ve f@@ un .

I see this p@@ lu@@ s sig@@ n .
"If the mu@@ se@@ um has given us the image , you cli@@ ck on it ."
Now this is one of the ima@@ ges .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interested in art , you can cli@@ ck this — but I &apos;m going to cli@@ ck this off right now ."
And this is one of these ima@@ ges that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ."
And I get a lot of people as@@ king me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ oo@@ m around very simply .
You see some f@@ un stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pri@@ ce@@ less .
But then you really want to go de@@ ep .
"And so I started pla@@ ying around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That s@@ ounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started no@@ tic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."

And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite popu@@ lar .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really de@@ ep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks ."
"Now just to give you some per@@ spe@@ ctive , I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m out so you really see what you get ."
"H@@ ere is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."

But what if you want to see b@@ ru@@ sh st@@ ro@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
You z@@ oo@@ m in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fav@@ or@@ ite parts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fav@@ or@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real co@@ ol part . It &apos;s called C@@ ol@@ le@@ ctions .
"An@@ y one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re ri@@ ch , if you &apos;re po@@ or , if you have a fan@@ cy house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mu@@ se@@ um on@@ line — create your own colle@@ ction across all these ima@@ ges .
"@@ V@@ er@@ y simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The P@@ o@@ wer of Z@@ oo@@ m — you can just z@@ oo@@ m around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the Na@@ tional G@@ al@@ ler@@ y ."
"You can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , sen@@ d it to your friends and really get a conver@@ sa@@ tion going about what you &apos;re fe@@ eling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pi@@ e@@ ces ."
"So I think , in con@@ clu@@ sion , for me , the ma@@ in thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ i@@ on , even come from the mu@@ se@@ um@@ s ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my h@@ um@@ b@@ ling experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this di@@ git@@ al medi@@ um that we do ju@@ sti@@ ce to their art@@ work and re@@ present it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the big@@ gest question I get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ ate the experience of going to a mu@@ se@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .

I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , wr@@ iting no@@ v@@ els — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of stor@@ y@@ telling and also some su@@ per@@ natural cre@@ atu@@ res called the d@@ j@@ in@@ n@@ i ."
"But before I go there , ple@@ ase al@@ low me to share with you gli@@ mp@@ ses of my person@@ al story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ cal shap@@ e , the cir@@ cle , so throu@@ gh@@ out my talk , you will come across sever@@ al cir@@ c@@ les ."
"I was born in S@@ tr@@ as@@ b@@ our@@ g , Fran@@ ce to T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish parents ."
"S@@ h@@ ort@@ ly after , my parents got se@@ para@@ ted , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mo@@ m ."
"F@@ rom then on , I was ra@@ i@@ sed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s , in An@@ kar@@ a , that was a bit unu@@ su@@ al ."
"O@@ ur neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od was full of large famili@@ es , where fa@@ thers were the he@@ ads of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up ob@@ ser@@ ving two different kinds of wo@@ man@@ ho@@ od ."
"O@@ n the one hand was my mother , a wel@@ l-@@ edu@@ cated , se@@ cu@@ lar , modern , we@@ ster@@ n@@ ized , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman ."
"O@@ n the other hand was my gran@@ d@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual , less edu@@ cated and defin@@ i@@ tely less ra@@ tional ."
This was a woman who read co@@ f@@ fe@@ e gr@@ ounds to see the future and me@@ l@@ ted le@@ ad into my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous shap@@ es to f@@ end off the ev@@ il eye .
"M@@ any people vi@@ si@@ ted my gran@@ d@@ mother , people with sev@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their hands ."
"E@@ ach time , my gran@@ d@@ mother would ut@@ ter some words in Ara@@ bi@@ c , take a red app@@ le and sta@@ b it with as many r@@ ose th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would en@@ cir@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with dar@@ k ink ."
"A week later , the pati@@ ent would come back for a fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up exa@@ min@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be saying such things in front of an audi@@ ence of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scienti@@ sts , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who vi@@ si@@ ted my gran@@ d@@ mother for their sk@@ in con@@ di@@ tions , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of pra@@ ying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , pra@@ ying is effe@@ ctive , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ c@@ les . &quot; &quot; F@@ rom her , I learned , a@@ mon@@ g@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous le@@ s@@ son — that if you want to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a b@@ le@@ mi@@ sh or the human s@@ ou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ r@@ ound it with th@@ ic@@ k wal@@ ls ."
It will dr@@ y up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tu@@ ral cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , cla@@ ss ."
"But if we have no conne@@ ction w@@ hat@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ yon@@ d the one we take for gran@@ ted , then we too run the risk of dr@@ ying up inside ."
"O@@ ur ima@@ gin@@ ation might sh@@ r@@ ink ; our he@@ ar@@ ts might d@@ win@@ dle , and our human@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we st@@ ay for too long inside our cul@@ tu@@ ral co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , neigh@@ bor@@ s , col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle re@@ se@@ m@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded with our mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my gran@@ d@@ ma do in T@@ ur@@ key is to co@@ ver mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors with v@@ el@@ vet or to han@@ g them on the wal@@ ls with their bac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ as@@ ter@@ n tradi@@ tion based on the knowle@@ dge that it &apos;s not heal@@ thy for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ fle@@ ction .
"I@@ ron@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; communi@@ ties of the lik@@ e-@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ a@@ test dan@@ gers of today &apos;s glob@@ al@@ ized world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , a@@ mon@@ g li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ ser@@ va@@ ti@@ ves , a@@ gn@@ os@@ tics and beli@@ e@@ ver@@ s , the ri@@ ch and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est al@@ ik@@ e ."
"We t@@ end to form clu@@ ster@@ s based on si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity , and then we produ@@ ce ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es about other clu@@ ster@@ s of people ."
"In my op@@ in@@ i@@ on , one way of trans@@ cen@@ ding these cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of stor@@ y@@ telling ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies cannot demo@@ li@@ sh fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ un@@ ch hol@@ es in our mental wal@@ ls ."
"And through those hol@@ es , we can get a gli@@ mp@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion at the age of e@@ ight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in ke@@ ep@@ ing a person@@ al jour@@ n@@ al .
"In re@@ tr@@ os@@ pe@@ ct , I think she was sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ri@@ ed about my san@@ ity ."
"I was con@@ stan@@ tly telling stories at home , which was good , ex@@ cept I told this to ima@@ gin@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ating with col@@ or@@ ed cra@@ yon@@ s and ap@@ ologi@@ z@@ ing to obje@@ cts when I bu@@ mp@@ ed into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to wr@@ ite down my day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day experi@@ ences and emo@@ tions ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was ter@@ ri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to wr@@ ite about myself ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I began to wr@@ ite about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us began my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long pas@@ sion for wr@@ iting fic@@ tion .
"So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation than a trans@@ cen@@ den@@ tal jour@@ ney into other lives , other possi@@ bili@@ ties ."
And ple@@ ase be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ p@@ lo@@ ma@@ t .
"So from this small , su@@ per@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ cla@@ ss neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of my gran@@ d@@ mother , I was z@@ oo@@ med into this pos@@ h , inter@@ national school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive for@@ e@@ i@@ gn@@ er . &quot; &quot; In our cla@@ ss@@ room , there were children from all na@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties , yet this di@@ versity did not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily le@@ ad to a cos@@ m@@ op@@ oli@@ tan , e@@ g@@ al@@ it@@ ar@@ ian cla@@ ss@@ room democra@@ cy ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , it gener@@ ated an atmos@@ p@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individu@@ al on his own , but as the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was f@@ un , ex@@ cept wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ ga@@ tive , with re@@ gar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a reli@@ gi@@ on , took place ."
"The child who re@@ presen@@ ted it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led and bul@@ li@@ ed en@@ d@@ le@@ ss@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a mili@@ tar@@ y tak@@ e@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my na@@ tion@@ ality ne@@ ar@@ ly kil@@ led the P@@ op@@ e , and T@@ ur@@ key got zer@@ o poin@@ ts in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed school often and dre@@ a@@ med of be@@ coming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
I also had my first tas@@ te of cul@@ tu@@ ral ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es there .
"The other children asked me about the movi@@ e &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night E@@ x@@ pre@@ ss , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qui@@ red how many ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes a day I s@@ mo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my ha@@ ir ."
"I came to learn that these were the three ma@@ in ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es about my country : poli@@ tics , ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ pa@@ in , we went to J@@ or@@ dan , Ger@@ many and An@@ kar@@ a again ."
"E@@ very@@ where I went , I felt like my ima@@ gin@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies gave me a sense of cen@@ ter , contin@@ u@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se la@@ c@@ ked ."
"In my mid@@ -@@ tw@@ en@@ ties , I mo@@ ved to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ verse neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od where I wr@@ ote sever@@ al of my no@@ v@@ els ."
I was in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it in 199@@ 9 .
"When I ran out of the building at three in the mor@@ ning , I saw something that st@@ opp@@ ed me in my tra@@ cks ."
"There was the local gro@@ cer there — a gru@@ mp@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t se@@ ll al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t spe@@ ak to mar@@ gin@@ als ."
He was si@@ tting next to a trans@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ car@@ a run@@ ning down her che@@ eks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ac@@ k of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes with tre@@ mb@@ ling hands and off@@ er one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive gro@@ cer and a c@@ r@@ ying trans@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te s@@ mo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ walk ."
"In the face of death and de@@ stru@@ ction , our m@@ un@@ dan@@ e differ@@ ences ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stories , too , have a si@@ mi@@ lar effe@@ ct on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are read@@ ing a good no@@ vel , we leave our small , co@@ z@@ y ap@@ art@@ ments behind , go out into the night al@@ one and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ as@@ ed against ."
"S@@ h@@ ort@@ ly after , I went to a women &apos;s colle@@ ge in B@@ os@@ ton , then M@@ ic@@ hi@@ gan ."
"I experi@@ en@@ ced this , not so much as a ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal shi@@ ft , as a lin@@ gu@@ isti@@ c one ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion in En@@ gli@@ sh .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the com@@ mu@@ te between langu@@ a@@ ges gi@@ ves me the chan@@ ce to re@@ create myself ."
"I love wr@@ iting in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very emo@@ tional , and I love wr@@ iting in En@@ gli@@ sh , which to me is very ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical and cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l ."
So I feel conne@@ cted to each language in a different way .
"For me , like mil@@ lions of other people around the world today , En@@ gli@@ sh is an ac@@ qui@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a la@@ te@@ com@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a contin@@ u@@ ous and per@@ pet@@ ual f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion ."
"As la@@ te@@ co@@ mers , we always want to say more , you know , cra@@ ck better j@@ ok@@ es , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the mind and the ton@@ gue ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ting .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also sti@@ mu@@ la@@ ting ."
And this is what I disco@@ vered in B@@ os@@ ton — that f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion was very sti@@ mu@@ la@@ ting .
"A@@ t this st@@ age , my gran@@ d@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , started to inclu@@ de in her da@@ ily pra@@ yer@@ s that I ur@@ gen@@ tly get mar@@ ri@@ ed so that I could se@@ ttle down once and for all ."
"And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ri@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of se@@ tt@@ ling down , I went to A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , I started com@@ mu@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona and I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a no@@ ma@@ d , physi@@ cally and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ally ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies ac@@ company me , ke@@ ep@@ ing my pi@@ e@@ ces and me@@ mor@@ ies together , like an ex@@ ist@@ ential g@@ lue ."
"Y@@ et as much as I love stories , re@@ cen@@ tly , I &apos;ve also be@@ g@@ un to think that they l@@ ose their ma@@ gi@@ c if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a sub@@ je@@ ct that I would love to think about together .
"When my first no@@ vel wr@@ it@@ ten in En@@ gli@@ sh came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic ."
"&quot; I lik@@ ed your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I w@@ ish you had wr@@ it@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ pan@@ ish , American , H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic charac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the no@@ vel took place on a uni@@ versity ca@@ mp@@ us in B@@ os@@ ton , so to me , it was normal that there be more inter@@ national charac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ters , but I under@@ sto@@ od what my cri@@ tic was looking for ."
And I also under@@ sto@@ od that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of my iden@@ ti@@ ty .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of iden@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ tics af@@ fe@@ cts the way stories are being cir@@ cu@@ la@@ ted , read and re@@ vie@@ wed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pre@@ ss@@ ure , but non@@ -@@ We@@ ster@@ n au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ av@@ ily ."
"If you &apos;re a woman wr@@ it@@ er from the M@@ us@@ lim world , like me , then you are expe@@ cted to wr@@ ite the stories of M@@ us@@ lim women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy M@@ us@@ lim women ."
"You &apos;re expe@@ cted to wr@@ ite in@@ forma@@ tive , po@@ i@@ gn@@ ant and charac@@ ter@@ isti@@ c stories and leave the experim@@ en@@ tal and av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de to your We@@ ster@@ n col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es ."
What I experi@@ en@@ ced as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ rit@@ ers are not seen as crea@@ tive individu@@ als on their own , but as the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of their re@@ spe@@ ctive cul@@ tures : a few au@@ th@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from N@@ i@@ ger@@ ia ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very di@@ st@@ inc@@ tive , if not pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ."
The wr@@ it@@ er and com@@ mu@@ ter J@@ a@@ mes B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in gave an inter@@ view in 19@@ 8@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ a@@ te@@ dly asked about his ho@@ mos@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vie@@ wer tried to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ h@@ ole him as a g@@ ay wr@@ it@@ er , B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in st@@ opp@@ ed and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en iden@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ tics tries to put la@@ be@@ ls on us , it is our fre@@ e@@ dom of ima@@ gin@@ ation that is in dan@@ ger ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ z@@ y ca@@ te@@ gor@@ y called m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral liter@@ ature in which all au@@ th@@ ors from outside the We@@ ster@@ n world are lu@@ mp@@ ed together .
"I never for@@ get my first m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral read@@ ing , in Har@@ var@@ d S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three wr@@ it@@ ers , one from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ don@@ e@@ si@@ an — like a j@@ ok@@ e , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were b@@ rought together was not because we sh@@ ared an arti@@ stic st@@ yle or a liter@@ ary tas@@ te .
It was only because of our pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral wr@@ it@@ ers are expe@@ cted to tell real stories , not so much the ima@@ gin@@ ary ."
A fun@@ ction is at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the wr@@ it@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional charac@@ ters become the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of something lar@@ ger ."
But I must quickly ad@@ d that this ten@@ den@@ cy to see a story as more than a story does not sol@@ ely come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ en@@ ced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fic@@ tional charac@@ ters ut@@ ter@@ ed in a no@@ vel .
"I had in@@ ten@@ ded to wr@@ ite a con@@ stru@@ ctive , multi@@ -@@ la@@ yer@@ ed no@@ vel about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women ."
My mi@@ c@@ r@@ o story became a ma@@ c@@ r@@ o issu@@ e when I was pr@@ os@@ ecu@@ ted .
"S@@ ome people cri@@ tic@@ ized , others pra@@ i@@ sed me for wr@@ iting about the T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian con@@ fli@@ ct ."
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both si@@ des that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to be@@ little my work ."
"I want to love and ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ rit@@ ers are enti@@ t@@ led to their political op@@ in@@ i@@ ons , and there are good political no@@ v@@ els out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of da@@ ily poli@@ tics ."
"@@ Ch@@ ek@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solu@@ tion to a problem and the cor@@ re@@ ct way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the lat@@ ter is an arti@@ st &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility . &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ tics di@@ vide@@ s us . F@@ ic@@ tion conne@@ cts .
One is interested in s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing gener@@ al@@ iz@@ ations .
"The other , in n@@ u@@ an@@ ces ."
One dra@@ ws b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
The other reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ den@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ tics is made of so@@ li@@ d bri@@ cks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
"In the O@@ t@@ to@@ man times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler@@ s called &quot; &quot; me@@ d@@ da@@ h . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ f@@ fe@@ e h@@ ou@@ ses , where they would tell a story in front of an audi@@ ence , often im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ing ."
"W@@ ith each new person in the story , the me@@ d@@ da@@ h would change his vo@@ ice , im@@ person@@ ating that charac@@ ter ."
"E@@ very@@ body could go and list@@ en , you know — ordin@@ ary people , even the sul@@ tan , M@@ us@@ li@@ ms and non@@ -@@ M@@ us@@ li@@ ms ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies cut across all b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ al@@ es of N@@ as@@ re@@ d@@ din H@@ od@@ j@@ a , &quot; &quot; which were very popu@@ lar throu@@ gh@@ out the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast , Nor@@ th Africa , the B@@ al@@ kan@@ s and A@@ si@@ a ."
"T@@ o@@ day , stories contin@@ ue to trans@@ cen@@ d bor@@ ders ."
"When P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian and I@@ s@@ ra@@ eli poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans talk , they u@@ su@@ ally don &apos;t list@@ en to each other , but a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian read@@ er still re@@ ads a no@@ vel by a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish au@@ th@@ or , and vice ver@@ sa , conne@@ cting and emp@@ a@@ th@@ iz@@ ing with the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor ."
L@@ it@@ er@@ ature has to take us be@@ yon@@ d .
"If it cannot take us there , it is not good liter@@ ature ."
"B@@ o@@ ok@@ s have sa@@ ved the in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the dan@@ ger of fe@@ ti@@ shi@@ z@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and my@@ stic , R@@ u@@ mi , met his sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual compan@@ i@@ on , S@@ ha@@ ms of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the lat@@ ter did was to t@@ os@@ s R@@ u@@ mi &apos;s book@@ s into water and wat@@ ch the let@@ ters dis@@ sol@@ ve ."
"The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge that takes you not be@@ yon@@ d yourself is far wor@@ se than ig@@ nor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is not la@@ ck of knowle@@ dge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowle@@ dge that takes us not be@@ yon@@ d ourselves : it makes us eli@@ ti@@ st , di@@ st@@ ant and dis@@ conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or which I love : living like a dra@@ wing comp@@ as@@ s .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the comp@@ as@@ s is sta@@ tic , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g dra@@ ws a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , con@@ stan@@ tly moving ."
"L@@ ik@@ e that , my fic@@ tion as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , with str@@ ong T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part tra@@ v@@ els the world , conne@@ cting to different cul@@ tures ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both local and uni@@ ver@@ sal , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ kap@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the resi@@ den@@ ce of O@@ t@@ to@@ man sul@@ tan@@ s for more than 4@@ 00 years ."
"In the p@@ al@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the fav@@ or@@ ite con@@ cu@@ bin@@ es , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ la@@ ce of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ din@@ gs .
I &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this con@@ cept .
We u@@ su@@ ally di@@ stru@@ st those are@@ as that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the do@@ ma@@ in of su@@ per@@ natural cre@@ atu@@ res like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of s@@ mo@@ ke@@ less fir@@ e and are the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is perhaps that el@@ u@@ sive space is what wr@@ it@@ ers and arti@@ sts need most .
Wh@@ en I wr@@ ite fic@@ tion I ch@@ er@@ ish el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not kno@@ wing what will happen 10 pa@@ ges later .
I like it when my charac@@ ters surpri@@ se me .
"I might wr@@ ite about a M@@ us@@ lim woman in one no@@ vel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might wr@@ ite about a han@@ d@@ some , g@@ ay profes@@ s@@ or in Nor@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our he@@ ar@@ ts , we can wr@@ ite about anything and everything ."
"A@@ u@@ d@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The wh@@ ite fa@@ thers ta@@ u@@ ght us to say , &apos; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She sug@@ ge@@ s@@ ted , &quot; &quot; I feel , ther@@ e@@ fore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful para@@ di@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in crea@@ tive wr@@ iting cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we te@@ ach students is &quot; &quot; wr@@ ite what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
P@@ er@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ ma@@ gin@@ a@@ tive liter@@ ature is not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily about wr@@ iting who we are or what we know or what our iden@@ ti@@ ty is about .
We should te@@ ach young people and ourselves to exp@@ and our he@@ ar@@ ts and wr@@ ite what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to and go vi@@ sit the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ v@@ ish@@ es , dra@@ wing cir@@ c@@ les be@@ yon@@ d cir@@ c@@ les ."
"They conne@@ ct all human@@ ity , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of iden@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ tics , and that is the good news ."
"And I would like to fin@@ ish with an old Su@@ f@@ i po@@ e@@ m : &quot; &quot; C@@ ome , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ ver@@ s and lo@@ ved ones ; the ear@@ th sh@@ all be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
We do ac@@ hi@@ eve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , colle@@ cti@@ vely all the Wor@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ raf@@ t ga@@ mers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ zer@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing ."
We &apos;re ev@@ ol@@ ving to be a more col@@ labor@@ a@@ tive and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
And we actually build st@@ ron@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a res@@ ult .
F@@ ive million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
H@@ is work is br@@ il@@ li@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ ti@@ mal si@@ tu@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"Be@@ fore we had a@@ we@@ some game con@@ trol@@ ler@@ s , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les ."
P@@ eople were su@@ ff@@ ering . P@@ eople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really ex@@ c@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fa@@ mine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce game ."
"We want to imagine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to ac@@ hi@@ eve the e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in s@@ kil@@ ls like local in@@ si@@ ght , knowle@@ dge net@@ working , su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little to@@ wn in C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do , called C@@ ra@@ i@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ z@@ en squ@@ are mi@@ les . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es .
And the job in question was sh@@ e@@ ep ran@@ ch@@ er .
"My r@@ ole on the show , for those of you who ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an app@@ ren@@ ti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ si@@ bili@@ ties are to simply try and keep up and give an hon@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding sh@@ e@@ ep . Gre@@ at .
We go to C@@ ra@@ i@@ g and we che@@ ck in to a h@@ ot@@ el and I real@@ ize the next day that cas@@ tra@@ tion is going to be an absolu@@ te part of this work .
"So , nor@@ m@@ ally , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a tou@@ ch@@ y sub@@ je@@ ct , and I work for the D@@ is@@ co@@ very C@@ han@@ ne@@ l , and we want to p@@ ort@@ ra@@ y ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely w@@ hatever it is we do , and we cer@@ tain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of re@@ spe@@ ct for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety and I say , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I &apos;m going to be cas@@ tra@@ ting some la@@ mb@@ s , C@@ an you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little s@@ mal@@ ler ."
"This one was actually around the pla@@ ying car@@ ds I got ye@@ ster@@ day , but it had a certain famili@@ ar@@ ity to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the ta@@ il , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the s@@ c@@ r@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
B@@ lo@@ od f@@ low is s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ tar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; Gre@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ CA to con@@ fir@@ m this — they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for f@@ un , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the la@@ mb@@ s and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of anima@@ l h@@ us@@ ban@@ dr@@ y ."
M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up the la@@ m@@ b — two hands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , lik@@ e@@ wi@@ se on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the p@@ ost , she open@@ s it up ."
Al@@ right . Gre@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always wat@@ ch the process done the first time before I try it .
"Be@@ ing an app@@ ren@@ ti@@ ce , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ c@@ ket to pul@@ l out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of fli@@ c@@ ked it open in a way that ca@@ u@@ ght the sun that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ ti@@ la@@ ge of the ta@@ il , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the la@@ m@@ b , and very quickly the ta@@ il was gone and in the bu@@ c@@ ket that I was hol@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well cal@@ l@@ ou@@ sed for@@ e@@ fin@@ ger , he had the s@@ c@@ r@@ ot@@ um fir@@ m@@ ly in his gr@@ as@@ p ."
"And he pul@@ led it to@@ ward him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el — you don &apos;t , OK ?"
"He s@@ ni@@ ps it , th@@ ro@@ ws the ti@@ p over his sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and then gra@@ b@@ s the s@@ c@@ r@@ ot@@ um and pu@@ sh@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , ob@@ s@@ cur@@ ing my view , but what I hear is a s@@ l@@ ur@@ p@@ ing sound , and a no@@ ise that s@@ ounds like V@@ el@@ c@@ r@@ o being yan@@ ked off a sti@@ ck@@ y w@@ all and I am not even ki@@ d@@ ding ."
C@@ an we rol@@ l the video ?
No I &apos;m ki@@ d@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pic@@ tures .
"So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; sh@@ oo@@ t , ever ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; T@@ ime out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two ."
"There &apos;s no wr@@ iting , there &apos;s no s@@ cri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense ."
"We don &apos;t f@@ ool around , we don &apos;t re@@ he@@ ar@@ se — we sh@@ oo@@ t what we get !@@ "
"I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is n@@ u@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know ."
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is cra@@ z@@ y .
"We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ ber@@ t &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are te@@ sti@@ c@@ les in this bu@@ c@@ ket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him expla@@ in , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; L@@ ik@@ e the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , like the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety ."
"L@@ et &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the la@@ m@@ b squ@@ e@@ al and b@@ le@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de ."
"We &apos;re on tw@@ ice a day on the D@@ is@@ co@@ very C@@ han@@ ne@@ l — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his bo@@ x and he pul@@ ls out a ba@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds ."
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up another la@@ m@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the p@@ ost , b@@ and goes on the ta@@ il , b@@ and goes on the s@@ c@@ r@@ ot@@ um ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , la@@ m@@ b takes two ste@@ ps , fal@@ ls down , gets up , s@@ ha@@ kes a little , takes another couple ste@@ ps , fal@@ ls down ."
"I &apos;m like , this is not a good sig@@ n for this la@@ m@@ b , at all ."
"G@@ ets up , wal@@ ks to the cor@@ ner , it &apos;s qui@@ ver@@ ing , and it li@@ es down and it &apos;s in obvi@@ ous di@@ stre@@ ss ."
"And I &apos;m looking at the la@@ m@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ber@@ t , how long ?"
"When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to f@@ all off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;"
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the la@@ m@@ b that he had just did his little pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re on is , you know , he &apos;s just p@@ ran@@ cing around , b@@ le@@ e@@ ding st@@ opp@@ ed ."
"He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ b@@ b@@ ling on some gr@@ as@@ s , f@@ ro@@ li@@ c@@ king ."
"And I was just so blo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second ."
"And I was re@@ min@@ ded how ut@@ ter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time ."
"( Laughter ) And I was es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally re@@ min@@ ded of what an ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously sh@@ ort stra@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ ber@@ t had just done , and there are like 100 of these la@@ mb@@ s in the p@@ en , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly this whole thing &apos;s star@@ ting to feel like a Ger@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up the la@@ m@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the p@@ ost , open@@ s it up ."
Al@@ ber@@ t hands me the k@@ ni@@ fe .
"I go in , ta@@ il comes off ."
"I go in , I gra@@ b the s@@ c@@ r@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ p comes off ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t in@@ stru@@ cts , &quot; &quot; P@@ us@@ h it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do ."
&quot; P@@ us@@ h it f@@ ur@@ ther . &quot;
I do .
"The te@@ sti@@ c@@ les emer@@ ge — they look like th@@ um@@ b@@ s , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; B@@ ite &apos; e@@ m ."
"@@ Ju@@ st bi@@ te &apos; e@@ m off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words ."
"( Laughter ) L@@ ik@@ e , how did — how did I get here ?"
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those mo@@ ments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , I &apos;m standing there , in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , and all I can think of is the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ eli@@ an defin@@ i@@ tion of a tra@@ ge@@ dy ."
"You know , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le says a tra@@ ge@@ dy is that moment when the her@@ o comes face to face with his true iden@@ ti@@ ty ."
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this j@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ?"
"I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my si@@ ght , so I did what I had to do ."
I went in and I took them .
"I took them like this , and I yan@@ ked my face back ."
And I &apos;m standing there with two te@@ sti@@ c@@ les on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t s@@ ha@@ ke the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"O@@ K , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; P@@ o@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of no@@ where , two terms come c@@ ras@@ h@@ ing into my head that I ha@@ ven &apos;t heard since my cla@@ s@@ si@@ cs profes@@ s@@ or in colle@@ ge dr@@ il@@ led them there ."
And they are an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
A@@ na@@ g@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
A@@ na@@ g@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the Gre@@ ek word for disco@@ very .
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , the tran@@ si@@ tion from ig@@ nor@@ ance to knowle@@ dge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is ."
It &apos;s what our net@@ work does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my ne@@ ck in an@@ ag@@ nor@@ i@@ ses every single day .
Gre@@ at .
"The other word , peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tra@@ ge@@ dies , you know — E@@ u@@ ri@@ p@@ ide@@ s and S@@ op@@ ho@@ c@@ les — the moment where O@@ edi@@ p@@ us has his moment , where he su@@ d@@ den@@ ly real@@ iz@@ es that ho@@ t chi@@ ck he &apos;s been s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing with and having ba@@ bi@@ es with is his mother . OK ."
That &apos;s per@@ ip@@ ety or peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
And this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
"( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great de@@ vice though ."
"When you start to look for peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a , you find it every@@ where ."
"I mean , B@@ ru@@ ce W@@ il@@ li@@ s in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"S@@ pen@@ ds the whole movi@@ e trying to help the little k@@ id who se@@ es de@@ ad people , and then , bo@@ om — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m de@@ ad &quot; &quot; — peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a ."
You know ?
It &apos;s cru@@ sh@@ ing when the audi@@ ence se@@ es it the right way .
"N@@ e@@ o in &quot; &quot; The M@@ at@@ ri@@ x , &quot; &quot; you know ?"
"&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s we@@ ird ."
"These disco@@ ver@@ ies that le@@ ad to su@@ d@@ den real@@ iz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dir@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s , I have them all the time , but that one — that one dr@@ il@@ led something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for ."
"And , as I sto@@ od there , looking at the happy la@@ m@@ b that I had just de@@ fi@@ led — but it looked OK ."
"L@@ o@@ ok@@ ing at that po@@ or other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was stru@@ ck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other peri@@ pa@@ te@@ tic mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment up@@ on ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ologi@@ st but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey M@@ ik@@ e ."
"L@@ o@@ ok , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you real@@ ize you &apos;ve sho@@ t in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in f@@ ish@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every maj@@ or indu@@ stry ."
"You &apos;ve had your back sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der with these guys that our poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans are des@@ per@@ ate to rela@@ te to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ il@@ lar@@ y doing the sh@@ ots of r@@ ye , dri@@ b@@ b@@ ling down her ch@@ in , with the ste@@ el work@@ ers ."
"I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day ."
"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thou@@ ghts , colle@@ cti@@ vely , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , te@@ sti@@ c@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thou@@ ghts are b@@ oun@@ cing around ."
"And , after that sh@@ oo@@ t , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , person@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other no@@ tions of work that I &apos;ve just been as@@ su@@ ming are sa@@ c@@ ros@@ an@@ ct , and they &apos;re not ."
P@@ eople with dir@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s are happ@@ i@@ er than you think .
"As a group , they &apos;re the happ@@ i@@ est people I know ."
"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ ist@@ ling &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok for the Uni@@ on La@@ be@@ l , &quot; &quot; and all that happy work@@ er cra@@ p ."
I &apos;m just telling you that these are b@@ alan@@ ced people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
Ro@@ ad@@ k@@ ill pic@@ ker@@ -@@ up@@ per@@ s wh@@ ist@@ le while they work . I s@@ we@@ ar to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sy@@ mme@@ try to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we challen@@ ged some of these sa@@ cre@@ d co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — what could possi@@ bly be wrong with that ?
Pro@@ bab@@ ly the wor@@ st ad@@ vice I ever got .
"( Laughter ) You know , fol@@ low your dre@@ a@@ ms and go bro@@ ke , right ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard gro@@ wing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exa@@ mp@@ les , right now — B@@ o@@ b Co@@ mb@@ s , the pi@@ g far@@ mer in L@@ as V@@ e@@ g@@ as who colle@@ cts the un@@ e@@ aten s@@ c@@ rap@@ s of food from the cas@@ in@@ os and fe@@ eds them them to his s@@ w@@ ine ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because there &apos;s so much prote@@ in in the stuff we don &apos;t e@@ at his pi@@ gs grow at tw@@ ice the normal spe@@ ed , and he is one ri@@ ch pi@@ g far@@ mer , and he is good for the environment , and he sp@@ ends his days doing this incredi@@ ble ser@@ vice , and he s@@ me@@ l@@ ls like h@@ ell , but God b@@ less him ."
He &apos;s making a great living .
"You ask him , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d la@@ u@@ gh at you ."
"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got off@@ er@@ ed like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ e@@ g@@ as ."
He didn &apos;t fol@@ low his pas@@ sion .
He ste@@ pp@@ ed back and he wat@@ ched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
"M@@ at@@ t F@@ ro@@ ind , a da@@ ir@@ y far@@ mer in New C@@ an@@ a@@ an , Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ cut , who w@@ ok@@ e up one day and realized the cra@@ p from his co@@ ws was wor@@ th more than their mil@@ k , if he could use it to make these bi@@ o@@ de@@ gra@@ da@@ ble flo@@ wer p@@ ots ."
"Now , he &apos;s sel@@ ling them to W@@ al@@ mar@@ t ."
F@@ ol@@ low his pas@@ sion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
"So I started to look at pas@@ sion , I started to look at e@@ ff@@ ici@@ en@@ cy ver@@ su@@ s effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess — as T@@ im tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er , that &apos;s a huge di@@ st@@ in@@ ction ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those pla@@ ti@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; suc@@ ce@@ s@@ sor@@ ies &quot; &quot; that han@@ g with that sch@@ mal@@ t@@ z@@ y art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ o@@ ms around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all been turned on its head .
S@@ af@@ ety — sa@@ f@@ ety first ?
"G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ ety : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really sa@@ f@@ ety third ?"
R@@ ight ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I value my sa@@ f@@ ety on these cra@@ z@@ y j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about sa@@ f@@ ety first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ ering Se@@ a , I was on a cra@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ li@@ est C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 mi@@ les off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a : 5@@ 0@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t se@@ as , big wa@@ ves , gre@@ en water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"M@@ ost haz@@ ar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , la@@ sh@@ ing the p@@ ots down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the de@@ ck , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean ."
U@@ n@@ spe@@ ak@@ ably dan@@ ger@@ ous .
"I s@@ ca@@ mp@@ er down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ du@@ li@@ ty , &quot; C@@ ap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;"
"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ ce@@ an . &quot; &quot; And he poin@@ ts out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ tor@@ y flo@@ or or any con@@ stru@@ ction site .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he cal@@ ls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cra@@ b bo@@ at ."
My respon@@ si@@ bility is not to get you home ali@@ ve .
"My respon@@ si@@ bility is to get you home ri@@ ch . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home ali@@ ve , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the rest of that day , sa@@ f@@ ety first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this fal@@ se — this sense of comp@@ la@@ cen@@ cy when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice ver@@ sa ."
"An@@ y@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at len@@ g@@ th about the many little di@@ st@@ inc@@ tions we made and the en@@ d@@ less li@@ st of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I for@@ med a the@@ ory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ ma@@ ining two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve de@@ c@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a ci@@ vi@@ l war .
"It &apos;s a c@@ old war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he in some M@@ ac@@ hi@@ av@@ el@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve wa@@ ged this war on at least four fron@@ ts , cer@@ tain@@ ly in H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wo@@ od ."
The way we p@@ ort@@ ra@@ y working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s la@@ u@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
"If there &apos;s a p@@ lu@@ mber , he &apos;s 3@@ 00 p@@ ounds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t cra@@ ck . A@@ d@@ mit it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what p@@ lu@@ mb@@ ers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into p@@ un@@ ch lin@@ es ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve wa@@ ged this war on Ma@@ di@@ son A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a messa@@ ge , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ li@@ er , if you could re@@ ti@@ re a little fas@@ ter , if you could p@@ un@@ ch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even be@@ gin to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that af@@ fect the bot@@ to@@ m line reality of the a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , I mean — how many people have an i@@ P@@ h@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ la@@ ck@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re p@@ lu@@ g@@ ged in ; we &apos;re conne@@ cted .
I would never sug@@ gest for a second that something bad has come out of the te@@ ch re@@ v@@ olution .
"G@@ o@@ od g@@ ri@@ ef , not to this cro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would sug@@ gest that inno@@ v@@ ation without im@@ it@@ ation is a comple@@ te was@@ te of time .
And no@@ body ce@@ le@@ bra@@ tes im@@ it@@ ation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"Y@@ our i@@ P@@ h@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the gen@@ i@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x , you know ."
O@@ ur to@@ ols today don &apos;t look like sho@@ v@@ els and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the colle@@ ctive effe@@ ct of all of that has been this mar@@ gin@@ al@@ iz@@ ation of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the te@@ sti@@ c@@ les on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n for work , man@@ ual la@@ b@@ or , s@@ kil@@ led la@@ b@@ or ."
S@@ ome@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten ben@@ ef@@ its .
"I &apos;m talking about gran@@ d@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little ."
B@@ arac@@ k wan@@ ts to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture is a huge deal .
"This war on work , that I supp@@ ose ex@@ ists , has cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties like any other war ."
The inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture &apos;s the first one ; de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ rol@@ l@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electri@@ ci@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ pen@@ ters , fe@@ wer p@@ lu@@ mb@@ ers , fe@@ wer wel@@ ders , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about cre@@ ating are those guys — the ones that have been in de@@ cl@@ ine , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tr@@ il@@ lion dollars — at a min@@ im@@ um , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American So@@ ci@@ ety of C@@ i@@ vi@@ l En@@ gin@@ e@@ ers — that we need to exp@@ end to even make a dent in the inf@@ ras@@ tru@@ cture , which is cur@@ ren@@ tly ra@@ ted at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were run@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create ar@@ en &apos;t going to sti@@ ck un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fer@@ ence is to ce@@ le@@ bra@@ te things that are ne@@ ar and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and dir@@ ty ar@@ en &apos;t op@@ posi@@ tes ."
"They &apos;re two si@@ des of the same co@@ in , just like inno@@ v@@ ation and im@@ it@@ ation , like risk and respon@@ si@@ bility , like peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that po@@ or little la@@ m@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s gone ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right eye ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the value of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I met with medi@@ cal do@@ c@@ tors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produ@@ ctive , more in@@ spi@@ red , more j@@ oy@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ v@@ olution , this new fe@@ min@@ ist issu@@ e ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ li@@ ty sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l ."
I was re@@ cen@@ tly having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ g@@ ged that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast da@@ te , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about e@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck is too late for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence cal@@ ls and me@@ et you at e@@ ight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bu@@ s@@ y and produ@@ ctive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ il@@ li@@ ant lea@@ ders in business , in finan@@ ce , in poli@@ tics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good le@@ ad@@ er , because the essen@@ ce of lea@@ der@@ ship is being able to see the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ s .
"In fact , I have a fe@@ eling that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ister@@ s , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were bu@@ s@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ conne@@ cted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have no@@ tic@@ ed the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ ok@@ en up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a person@@ al level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own car@@ e@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your engin@@ es and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ r@@ is poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ ctions and stru@@ cture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minu@@ te about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can h@@ old in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ temp@@ late the v@@ as@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ temp@@ late the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ temp@@ late itself con@@ temp@@ la@@ ting on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the hol@@ y gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of neur@@ ology , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous or@@ gan ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of prot@@ op@@ la@@ s@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this ac@@ tivity emer@@ ges the whole spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of a@@ bili@@ ties that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ ctions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at pati@@ ents with su@@ sta@@ ined da@@ ma@@ ge to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gene@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ du@@ ction in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of b@@ l@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ g@@ ni@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly se@@ le@@ ctive los@@ s of one fun@@ ction , with other fun@@ ctions being pre@@ ser@@ ved in@@ t@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ olved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ ction ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ ction on@@ to stru@@ cture , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ ction ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exa@@ mp@@ les of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m gi@@ ving you three exa@@ mp@@ les , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an extra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the temp@@ or@@ al lo@@ be@@ s , fron@@ tal lo@@ be@@ s , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lo@@ be@@ s , OK — the lo@@ be@@ s that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner surface of the temp@@ or@@ al lo@@ be@@ s — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little stru@@ cture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you can no longer reco@@ gn@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still reco@@ gn@@ ize them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even reco@@ gn@@ ize yourself in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really reco@@ gn@@ ize yourself as yourself ."
OK . Now that sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is well known as ca@@ used by da@@ ma@@ ge to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even neur@@ ologi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s de@@ lu@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely normal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , comes out of co@@ ma , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and in@@ telli@@ g@@ ent in all other re@@ spe@@ cts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his de@@ lu@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ gu@@ ment app@@ li@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a str@@ ong se@@ x@@ ual at@@ tra@@ ction to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ edi@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ts these lat@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank God , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ ma@@ ging the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these lat@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fla@@ ming to the surface , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ li@@ c@@ ably you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your da@@ ma@@ ged brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ gu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ gu@@ ments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same de@@ lu@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same de@@ lu@@ sion , about his pe@@ t po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ if@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ if@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the lat@@ ent be@@ sti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expla@@ in this cu@@ ri@@ ous di@@ sor@@ der , we look at the stru@@ cture and fun@@ ctions of the normal vis@@ ual pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vis@@ ual sig@@ n@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ bal@@ ls , go to the vis@@ ual are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after pro@@ cess@@ ing all that , the messa@@ ge goes to a small stru@@ cture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , where you per@@ ce@@ ive fac@@ es ."
There are neur@@ ons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that area &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you l@@ ose the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the messa@@ ge cas@@ ca@@ des into a stru@@ cture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , and that stru@@ cture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the emo@@ tional sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ da@@ tor ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something absolu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of chal@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?"
W@@ hi@@ ch you can completely ig@@ nor@@ e .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a is ex@@ ci@@ ted , and this is something important , the messa@@ ges then cas@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ ton@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fas@@ ter .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cu@@ lar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and meas@@ ure the change in sk@@ in resi@@ stance produ@@ ced by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ mine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re ex@@ ci@@ ted or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ou@@ sed , or not , OK ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minu@@ te .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an obje@@ ct , when he looks at his — any obje@@ ct for that matter , it goes to the vis@@ ual are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s pro@@ ce@@ s@@ sed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and you reco@@ gn@@ ize it as a pe@@ a plan@@ t , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?"
"And then the messa@@ ge cas@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ ton@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , is cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ t@@ act , the cha@@ p can still reco@@ gn@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is cut to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ li@@ c@@ able la@@ ck of emo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some st@@ range woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and meas@@ ure your g@@ al@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can meas@@ ure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an obje@@ ct , like a table or an um@@ bre@@ l@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and meas@@ ure his g@@ al@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fla@@ t ."
"There &apos;s no emo@@ tional re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the vis@@ ual are@@ as to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters is cut ."
"So his vision is normal because the vis@@ ual are@@ as are normal , his emo@@ tions are normal — he &apos;ll la@@ u@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vision to emo@@ tions is cut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this de@@ lu@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a biz@@ ar@@ re , see@@ min@@ g@@ ly in@@ comp@@ re@@ hen@@ sible , ne@@ ural p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me and say that the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ ci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ ural an@@ at@@ omy of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no de@@ lu@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the he@@ aring cen@@ ters in the brain to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is amp@@ u@@ ta@@ ted , or a le@@ g is amp@@ u@@ ta@@ ted , for gan@@ g@@ ren@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ i@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the presen@@ ce of that mi@@ ss@@ ing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vis@@ cer@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had pati@@ ents with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ ster@@ ec@@ to@@ my — who have a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ to@@ m men@@ stru@@ al cra@@ mp@@ s at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stu@@ dent asked me the other day , &quot; D@@ o they get ph@@ an@@ to@@ m P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ je@@ ct ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ mb@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the pati@@ ents with ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ mb@@ s cla@@ im that they can move the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ."
"These are very comp@@ el@@ ling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not de@@ lu@@ sion@@ al .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a comp@@ el@@ ling sen@@ sor@@ y experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the pati@@ ents , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But do@@ ctor , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a c@@ len@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ ounds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ mb@@ s , the ori@@ gin@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve supp@@ lying the ar@@ m was sever@@ ed , was cut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d at@@ temp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on amp@@ u@@ ta@@ tes the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ i@@ ous c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ pres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , OK ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves supp@@ lying the ar@@ m had been cut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and lying in a s@@ ling for sever@@ al months before the amp@@ u@@ tation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ t@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , OK ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this He@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ a@@ tive lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m crea@@ tes a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve amp@@ u@@ ta@@ ted the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis car@@ ri@@ es over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , OK ?"
"Now , how do you help these pati@@ ents ?"
"H@@ ow do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , so you can reli@@ eve him of this ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ ating , c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , but give him vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m cra@@ mp ."
"H@@ ow do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts mil@@ lions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding a@@ gen@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ erek , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m amp@@ u@@ ta@@ ted 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ chi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , lying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was amp@@ u@@ ta@@ ted ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m , ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m left ar@@ m , which is c@@ len@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and the normal hand on the right side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the c@@ len@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m being re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fle@@ ction of the normal ar@@ m in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m has been re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ g@@ gle your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — your real fin@@ gers , or move your real fin@@ gers while looking in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vis@@ ual im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again , and the pa@@ in , the c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at your re@@ fle@@ ction of your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ g@@ g@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ p@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r re@@ fle@@ ction , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sor@@ y experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pa@@ in is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clos@@ es his eyes ."
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s c@@ len@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my God , o@@ h my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a can@@ dy stor@@ e ."
"So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my the@@ ory about learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis and the cri@@ tical r@@ ole of vis@@ ual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely u@@ se@@ less ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started real@@ iz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ y@@ sis that you see in neur@@ ology , like st@@ ro@@ ke , fo@@ cal dy@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple de@@ vice of using a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ erek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ erek , take it home and pra@@ cti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ ay@@ be , after a peri@@ od of pra@@ cti@@ ce , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and start moving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two we@@ eks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ je@@ cts , e@@ th@@ ic@@ s and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ erek , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no c@@ len@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m for@@ ear@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fin@@ gers dan@@ g@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my for@@ e@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and eli@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fin@@ gers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ fli@@ ct .
It &apos;s getting messa@@ ges from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sig@@ n@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ fli@@ ct , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it ga@@ tes the sig@@ n@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ars , the bon@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the bon@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ que has been tried on do@@ zen@@ s of pati@@ ents by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , and inde@@ ed , people have tried it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ y@@ sis is also learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also gone through c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ als , help@@ ing lots and lots of pati@@ ents ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ars now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ on called sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disco@@ vered by Fran@@ c@@ is G@@ alt@@ on in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ sin of C@@ har@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely normal , had the fol@@ lo@@ wing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ or@@ ed ."
"F@@ ive is b@@ lue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , e@@ ight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is indi@@ go , OK ?"
"Be@@ ar in mind , these people are completely normal in other re@@ spe@@ cts ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ ok@@ e col@@ or ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is b@@ lue , F sh@@ ar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ alt@@ on called it sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a , a min@@ g@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are di@@ st@@ in@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ d@@ dle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pe@@ cts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in famili@@ es , so G@@ alt@@ on said this is a her@@ edi@@ tar@@ y bas@@ is , a gene@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this le@@ cture , which is about crea@@ tivity — sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a is e@@ ight times more common a@@ mon@@ g arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other crea@@ tive people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ uses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One the@@ ory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ ki@@ es and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an Di@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a . All right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and num@@ bers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ros@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ me@@ mber I said it run@@ s in famili@@ es ?
That gi@@ ves you the c@@ lue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ normal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ uses this ab@@ normal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the charac@@ ter@@ isti@@ c mo@@ du@@ lar archi@@ te@@ cture of the a@@ du@@ l@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ ta@@ tes , then you get def@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get ton@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ conne@@ cted ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to en@@ ga@@ ge in met@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal thinking , lin@@ king see@@ min@@ g@@ ly un@@ rela@@ ted ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and Ju@@ li@@ et is the S@@ un . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ li@@ et is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing b@@ all of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic@@ s do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the sun , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the sun , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the sun ."
"I@@ n@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ at@@ er c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ at@@ er pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to@@ wards met@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal thinking and crea@@ tivity in people with sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the e@@ ight times more common in@@ ci@@ den@@ ce of sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a a@@ mon@@ g po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ ological view of sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one minu@@ te ?
"( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ nes@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . Ju@@ st like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent shap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ e@@ mes , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ iki , one of them is B@@ ou@@ ba ."
W@@ hi@@ ch one is K@@ iki and which one is B@@ ou@@ ba ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ iki and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ tan@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba , that &apos;s K@@ iki ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y@@ -@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a Mar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ model sy@@ nes@@ the@@ tic ab@@ stra@@ ction , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that sh@@ ar@@ p inf@@ le@@ ction — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your audi@@ tor@@ y cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being ex@@ ci@@ ted — K@@ iki , mi@@ mi@@ cs the vis@@ ual inf@@ le@@ ction , su@@ d@@ den inf@@ le@@ ction of that j@@ ag@@ ged shap@@ e ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is en@@ ga@@ ging in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly il@@ lu@@ sion , but these ph@@ ot@@ ons in your eye are doing this shap@@ e , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are ex@@ c@@ iting the audi@@ tor@@ y patter@@ n , but the brain is able to extra@@ ct the common den@@ o@@ min@@ at@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ stra@@ ction , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s of the brain , because when that &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , these people l@@ ose the ability to en@@ ga@@ ge in B@@ ou@@ ba K@@ iki , but they also l@@ ose the ability to en@@ ga@@ ge in met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that gli@@ t@@ ters is not g@@ old , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s g@@ old ."
"You have to meas@@ ure its speci@@ fic gra@@ v@@ ity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mi@@ ss the met@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this area is about e@@ ight times the size in high@@ er — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in humans — as in lo@@ wer pri@@ ma@@ tes ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the an@@ gu@@ lar g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , because it &apos;s the c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ads between he@@ aring , vision and tou@@ ch , and it became en@@ or@@ mous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human a@@ bili@@ ties like ab@@ stra@@ ction , met@@ ap@@ h@@ or and crea@@ tivity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers have been stu@@ d@@ ying for mil@@ len@@ ni@@ a , we scienti@@ sts can be@@ gin to exp@@ l@@ ore by doing brain ima@@ ging , and by stu@@ d@@ ying pati@@ ents and as@@ king the right questions ."
Thank you .

This story is about taking ima@@ gin@@ ation ser@@ i@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this ordin@@ ary materi@@ al , f@@ ish@@ net , used the same way for cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , bil@@ lo@@ wing , v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous for@@ ms the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged buil@@ din@@ gs in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ lik@@ ely person to be doing this .
"I never stu@@ died s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ ering or archi@@ te@@ cture ."
"In fact , after colle@@ ge I app@@ li@@ ed to seven art sch@@ o@@ ols and was re@@ je@@ cted by all seven ."
"I went off on my own to become an arti@@ st , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was off@@ er@@ ed a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to India ."
"P@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions of pain@@ tin@@ gs , I shi@@ pp@@ ed my pain@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ pu@@ ra@@ m ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This f@@ ish@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ge was fa@@ mous for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tried br@@ on@@ ze cas@@ ting .
But to make large for@@ ms was too he@@ av@@ y and ex@@ pen@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the f@@ is@@ her@@ men bun@@ dle their ne@@ ts into m@@ ounds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make v@@ olu@@ me@@ tri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d materi@@ als ."
My first sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture was made in col@@ labor@@ ation with these f@@ is@@ her@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ p@@ ort@@ ra@@ it ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ ide H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ is@@ ted them on pol@@ es to photo@@ grap@@ h .
I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ pp@@ le of w@@ ind in con@@ stan@@ tly chan@@ ging patter@@ ns .
I was mes@@ mer@@ ized .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stu@@ d@@ ying c@@ raf@@ t tradi@@ tions and col@@ labor@@ ating with arti@@ san@@ s , next in Li@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ia with la@@ ce mak@@ ers ."
"I lik@@ ed the f@@ ine de@@ ta@@ il it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an obje@@ ct you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"R@@ et@@ ur@@ ning to India to work with those f@@ is@@ her@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — in@@ st@@ al@@ led bri@@ ef@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ ist Man@@ ual S@@ ola@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pre@@ ser@@ ve my art .
"D@@ u@@ ra@@ ble , engine@@ er@@ ed , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ posi@@ tion to i@@ di@@ osy@@ n@@ cra@@ tic , deli@@ c@@ ate and ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could survi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ viol@@ et ra@@ ys , sal@@ t , air , pol@@ lu@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to move f@@ lu@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We needed something to h@@ old the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ f@@ fic cir@@ cle .
"So we ra@@ i@@ sed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gra@@ ce@@ ful@@ ly in an a@@ verage bre@@ e@@ ze and survi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ il@@ s for America &apos;s C@@ up ra@@ cing yac@@ h@@ ts na@@ med P@@ et@@ er H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He help@@ ed me tac@@ k@@ le the tw@@ in challen@@ ges of pre@@ ci@@ se shap@@ e and gen@@ tle mo@@ vement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ stand a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
"So I develop@@ ed a relation@@ ship with an indu@@ stri@@ al f@@ ish@@ net fac@@ tor@@ y , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make la@@ ce with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ late this an@@ ci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ osy@@ n@@ cra@@ tic han@@ d@@ c@@ raf@@ t into something machine oper@@ at@@ ors could produ@@ ce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we ra@@ i@@ sed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t la@@ ce net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had ima@@ gin@@ ed was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ lation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ se@@ ction had been b@@ land and an@@ on@@ y@@ mous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the w@@ ind &apos;s ch@@ or@@ e@@ o@@ graph@@ y un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , conne@@ cted to lim@@ it@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two dire@@ ctions that are new in my work .
"H@@ i@@ stor@@ ic P@@ hi@@ la@@ de@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pla@@ za , I felt , needed a materi@@ al for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ ghter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we experim@@ en@@ ted with tin@@ y at@@ o@@ miz@@ ed water par@@ tic@@ les to create a dr@@ y mi@@ st that is shap@@ ed by the w@@ ind and in te@@ sting , disco@@ vered that it can be shap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture materi@@ al to tra@@ ce the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y of the city &apos;s cir@@ cu@@ la@@ tor@@ y system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ex@@ t challenge , the Bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Americ@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ present the 3@@ 5 na@@ tions of the We@@ ster@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here and their inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to be@@ gin , but I said y@@ es ."
I read about the re@@ cent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in Ch@@ ile and the t@@ sun@@ a@@ mi that ri@@ pp@@ led across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s tec@@ ton@@ ic pla@@ tes , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s r@@ ot@@ ation and liter@@ ally sh@@ ort@@ en@@ ed the len@@ g@@ th of the day ."
"So I con@@ tac@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ sun@@ a@@ mi , and trans@@ la@@ ted it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of mi@@ c@@ ros@@ econ@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was sh@@ ort@@ en@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el r@@ ing , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts shap@@ e was too comple@@ x now .
"So I re@@ pla@@ ced the met@@ al ar@@ ma@@ ture with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine me@@ sh of a fi@@ ber 15 times st@@ ron@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ re@@ ly so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to ex@@ ist@@ ing buil@@ din@@ gs — liter@@ ally be@@ coming part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these comple@@ x net for@@ ms and model them with gra@@ v@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ i@@ mes S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ i@@ gh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft stru@@ c@@ tu@@ ral me@@ th@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ s@@ c@@ rap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fun@@ ding yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ in@@ ging these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for beau@@ ty in the tradi@@ tional things , in c@@ raf@@ t for@@ ms ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ te@@ ch materi@@ als and engine@@ ering to create v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lo@@ wing for@@ ms the scale of buil@@ din@@ gs ."
My arti@@ stic hor@@ iz@@ ons contin@@ ue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
"A@@ n at@@ tor@@ ney in the of@@ fi@@ ce who &apos;d never been interested in art , never vi@@ si@@ ted the local art mu@@ se@@ um , dra@@ g@@ ged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the gr@@ as@@ s , no@@ tic@@ ing the chan@@ ging patter@@ ns of w@@ ind be@@ side people they didn &apos;t know , sh@@ aring the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."

The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal a@@ x@@ is .

She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .

So when I was a k@@ id ...
this was my team .
( Laughter ) I st@@ un@@ k at sp@@ or@@ ts .
"I didn &apos;t like to play them , I didn &apos;t like to wat@@ ch them ."
So this is what I did . I went f@@ ish@@ ing .
My team had sh@@ run@@ k .
It was like liter@@ ally having your ros@@ ter dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted .
"And when I went to fish mark@@ ets , in sp@@ ite of where I was — whether I was in Nor@@ th Car@@ ol@@ ina , or Par@@ is , or L@@ on@@ don , or wh@@ er@@ ever — I ke@@ pt seeing this we@@ ir@@ dly re@@ pe@@ ating tro@@ pe of four cre@@ atu@@ res , again and again — on the men@@ us , on ice — sh@@ ri@@ mp , t@@ una , sal@@ m@@ on and co@@ d ."
"And I thought this was pretty st@@ range , and as I looked at it , I was wonder@@ ing , did any@@ one else no@@ ti@@ ce this sort of sh@@ r@@ in@@ king of the market ?"
"Well , when I looked into it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team ."
"O@@ r@@ din@@ ary people , the way they looked at se@@ af@@ o@@ od was like this ."
It &apos;s not an unu@@ su@@ al human charac@@ ter@@ isti@@ c to re@@ du@@ ce the natural world down to very few ele@@ ments .

"It &apos;s true of bir@@ ds , too ."
Well ...
I essen@@ ti@@ ally became an inf@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
