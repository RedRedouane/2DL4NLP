"When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"M@@ y father was list@@ ening to B@@ B@@ C N@@ e@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ u@@ su@@ al then , because the news m@@ os@@ tly de@@ pre@@ ssed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are g@@ one ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ ssed as a bo@@ y to es@@ c@@ ort my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no longer allo@@ wed to be outside alone , to a sec@@ re@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be edu@@ cated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would su@@ sp@@ ect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our boo@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y ba@@ gs so it would see@@ m we were just out sh@@ opp@@ ing .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly h@@ ot in su@@ mm@@ er .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the te@@ ac@@ her , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly be canc@@ el@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follo@@ wed ?
D@@ o they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
My gr@@ and@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A t@@ ot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ v@@ ince of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , he in@@ sist@@ ed that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my edu@@ cated mother became a te@@ ac@@ her .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for gir@@ ls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ cei@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ cei@@ ve an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , de@@ sp@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ ater risk in not edu@@ ca@@ ting his children ."
"D@@ uring T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being sc@@ ar@@ ed and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ c@@ ed to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our bloo@@ d to pay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed by deca@@ des of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ on@@ d high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ ead , I st@@ and here a p@@ rou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ i@@ dd@@ le@@ b@@ ury C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , my gr@@ and@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for d@@ ar@@ ing to edu@@ cate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the st@@ ree@@ ts of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ a@@ ms even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ b@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global ca@@ mp@@ ai@@ gn to edu@@ cate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for gir@@ ls in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing at opport@@ unity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ cate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ pos@@ ition ."
"L@@ i@@ ke A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their v@@ il@@ la@@ ge , and they liter@@ ally mi@@ ssed being kill@@ ed by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and b@@ ack@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to real@@ ize about A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , and this is something that is often dis@@ mi@@ ssed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who recogn@@ iz@@ es the val@@ ue in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t key in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the ini@@ ti@@ al and conv@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ g@@ oti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ext of a society like in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , we must have the supp@@ ort of men ."
"@@ Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , gir@@ ls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hund@@ reds — remember , it was il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million gir@@ ls are in school in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the fra@@ g@@ ility in chan@@ ges .
I f@@ ear that these chan@@ ges will not last much be@@ y@@ on@@ d the U.@@ S@@ . t@@ ro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ vo@@ cate for them , who enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing future and la@@ sting change ."
"T@@ o me , A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an is a country of hope and b@@ ound@@ less pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties , and every single day the gir@@ ls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ i@@ ke me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the wh@@ ite have se@@ par@@ ated .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more comple@@ x things appe@@ ar .
That &apos;s tw@@ ice as long as humans have been on this planet .
"And de@@ ep b@@ ene@@ ath those oce@@ ans , at cr@@ ac@@ ks in the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , you &apos;ve got he@@ at see@@ p@@ ing up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ ver@@ sity of el@@ em@@ ents ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ ot@@ ic che@@ mi@@ stry ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings start pu@@ tting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ trac@@ tive ?
A@@ re they a pot@@ ential m@@ ate ? A@@ re they a pot@@ ential net@@ working opport@@ unity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a mental re@@ su@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Wh@@ ere are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more pers@@ onal with it .
H@@ a@@ ve you ever had any dise@@ ases ?
H@@ a@@ ve you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed ?
D@@ o@@ es your b@@ re@@ ath sm@@ ell bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to s@@ le@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are ne@@ u@@ ro@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to see@@ k out people like ourselves .
We start form@@ ing c@@ li@@ qu@@ es as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance fe@@ els like .
"We b@@ on@@ d together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , r@@ ace , gen@@ der , the blo@@ ck that we gre@@ w up on ."
We see@@ k out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ for@@ ce our pers@@ onal cho@@ ices .
"S@@ ome@@ times , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s op@@ ening a tin@@ y little box and as@@ king you to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze yourself inside of it ."
"Because the ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies , I &apos;ve found , are too lim@@ iting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too n@@ ar@@ row .
And this can get really d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a di@@ sc@@ la@@ im@@ er about me , though , before we get too de@@ ep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was ra@@ is@@ ed in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two blo@@ cks from the e@@ pic@@ en@@ ter of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of big@@ ot@@ ry and the social re@@ stri@@ c@@ tions of a reli@@ gi@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ based up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing .
"Wh@@ ere I come from , if you wer@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ e@@ en or a radi@@ cal thin@@ ker or a per@@ form@@ ance arti@@ st of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , but as a k@@ id on the st@@ ree@@ ts of New York , you learn how to tr@@ ust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids w@@ ouldn &apos;t let me play b@@ as@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all with them .
They said they w@@ ouldn &apos;t let gir@@ ls play .
"So I went home , and I sha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a gir@@ l , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ pt up the char@@ a@@ de for e@@ ight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was pla@@ ying a k@@ id nam@@ ed W@@ al@@ ter in a mo@@ vi@@ e called &quot; &quot; J@@ u@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et t@@ ough that follo@@ wed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ g@@ ered him .
"S@@ e@@ e , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed up the la@@ y@@ ers of the per@@ form@@ ance of my identi@@ ty , because no one knew that I was actually a gir@@ l really pla@@ ying a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a gir@@ l — not my teach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in cla@@ ss and gra@@ b me by the th@@ ro@@ at to ch@@ ec@@ k for an A@@ d@@ am &apos;s app@@ le or gra@@ b my cr@@ ot@@ ch to ch@@ ec@@ k what I was working with .
"When I would go to the ba@@ th@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the st@@ all@@ s so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing st@@ anding up ."
A@@ t s@@ le@@ e@@ po@@ ver@@ s I would have p@@ an@@ ic att@@ ac@@ ks trying to brea@@ k it to gir@@ ls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t h@@ ate my body or my gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was per@@ form@@ ing this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate act .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fied as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed me as something like gen@@ der d@@ y@@ sm@@ or@@ p@@ hi@@ c and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just w@@ o@@ ke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a gir@@ l again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a gir@@ l me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a k@@ id beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sho@@ c@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had f@@ all@@ en in love , it was the last thing on either of our min@@ ds to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a gir@@ l ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I f@@ ell in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents b@@ at@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ as@@ h either ."
"S@@ e@@ e , it &apos;s one of the great b@@ le@@ ss@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allo@@ wed to be me , gro@@ wing and chan@@ ging in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , P@@ ro@@ pos@@ ition 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of d@@ ust around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ri@@ ed wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was struc@@ k by the fact that America , a country with such a t@@ ar@@ ni@@ shed ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts rec@@ ord , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mi@@ sta@@ kes so bl@@ at@@ antly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion on t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ par@@ ation of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was ess@@ enti@@ ally dra@@ wing ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ cal b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies throu@@ gh@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion was dra@@ wing ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ cal b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies around me ."
"If this was a war with two di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ate si@@ des , I , by de@@ fa@@ ult , f@@ ell on team g@@ ay , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent stra@@ ight ."
"A@@ t the time I was just begin@@ ning to e@@ mer@@ ge from this e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year pers@@ onal identi@@ ty c@@ ris@@ is z@@ i@@ g@@ z@@ a@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this aw@@ k@@ ward gir@@ l that looked like a bo@@ y in gir@@ l &apos;s c@@ lo@@ th@@ es to the op@@ pos@@ ite extre@@ me of this su@@ per sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ comp@@ en@@ s@@ ating , bo@@ y-@@ cha@@ sing gir@@ l@@ y-@@ gir@@ l to finally just a h@@ es@@ it@@ ant expl@@ or@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ bo@@ y@@ ish gir@@ l who li@@ ked both bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls dep@@ ending on the person ."
"I had spent a year photograp@@ h@@ ing this new gener@@ ation of gir@@ ls , much like myself , who f@@ ell kind of be@@ twe@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ines — gir@@ ls who sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ acy under@@ w@@ ear , gir@@ ls who had bo@@ ys &apos; ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts but wor@@ e gir@@ ly na@@ il poli@@ sh , gir@@ ls who had ey@@ es@@ ha@@ d@@ ow to mat@@ ch their sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ed k@@ ne@@ es , gir@@ ls who li@@ ked gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys who all li@@ ked bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls who all h@@ ated being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their f@@ ree@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our ut@@ op@@ i@@ an bu@@ b@@ ble exp@@ lo@@ ded into these ra@@ ging de@@ b@@ ates where p@@ und@@ its started li@@ k@@ ening our love to be@@ sti@@ ality on national t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion ."
"And this powerful a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ro@@ l@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
I was le@@ g@@ ally and in@@ di@@ sp@@ ut@@ ably a secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss ci@@ tiz@@ en .
I was not an acti@@ vi@@ st .
I wa@@ ve no f@@ la@@ gs in my own life .
But I was pla@@ gu@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ote to stri@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the va@@ st vari@@ ety of people that I knew based on one ele@@ ment of their char@@ ac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not de@@ ser@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even con@@ sci@@ ously met a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of their di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were ca@@ sting into secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss ci@@ tiz@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them pa@@ use .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I fi@@ gu@@ red out a way where I could int@@ ro@@ duce them to each other photograp@@ h@@ ic@@ ally without any arti@@ f@@ ice , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photograp@@ h you can ex@@ am@@ ine a li@@ on &apos;s wh@@ is@@ kers without the f@@ ear of him ri@@ pp@@ ing your face off .
"For me , photograp@@ h@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing fil@@ m , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vi@@ e@@ wer to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t g@@ one before , but most import@@ antly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed gener@@ ations of people to dist@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew ex@@ ist@@ ed through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a ser@@ ies of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photograp@@ h any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent stra@@ ight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a lim@@ it@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I r@@ an out in the f@@ ree@@ zing co@@ ld , and I photograp@@ h@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photograp@@ h@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fund@@ ed two weeks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( M@@ usic ) V@@ ide@@ o : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ le@@ t@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an arti@@ st born and ra@@ is@@ ed in New York C@@ ity . ( M@@ usic )@@ "
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photograp@@ hi@@ c rec@@ ord of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .
My ai@@ m is to take a simple por@@ tra@@ it of any@@ one who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent stra@@ ight or fe@@ els like they f@@ all in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q spec@@ tr@@ um in any way .
My go@@ al is to show the human@@ ity that ex@@ i@@ sts in every one of us through the simp@@ li@@ city of a face .
( M@@ usic ) &quot; We h@@ old these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent that all men are created equ@@ al . &quot;
It &apos;s wr@@ it@@ ten in the D@@ ec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ dep@@ end@@ ence .
We are fa@@ il@@ ing as a n@@ ation to u@@ ph@@ old the mor@@ als up@@ on which we were f@@ oun@@ ded .
There is no equ@@ ality in the United States .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equ@@ ality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ri@@ age &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; F@@ ree@@ dom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ i@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ re@@ at every person as you &apos;d tre@@ at yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that ."
The fi@@ ght for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts is not just about g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age .
"T@@ o@@ day in 2@@ 9 st@@ ates , more than half of this country , you can le@@ g@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hund@@ reds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve sho@@ t 3@@ 00 fac@@ es in New York C@@ ity .
And we w@@ ouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the gener@@ ous supp@@ ort of the H@@ u@@ man R@@ i@@ ghts C@@ a@@ mp@@ ai@@ gn .
I want to take the project across the country .
"I want to vi@@ s@@ it 25 American cities , and I want to sh@@ oo@@ t 4@@ ,000 or 5@@ ,000 people ."
This is my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts fi@@ ght of my gener@@ ation .
I challenge you to look into the fac@@ es of these people and tell them that they de@@ ser@@ ve less than any other human being .
"( M@@ usic ) &#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ el@@ f evi@@ dent tru@@ ths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4@@ ,000 fac@@ es across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( M@@ usic ) ( Applause ) i@@ O T@@ il@@ le@@ t@@ t W@@ right : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely nothing could have pre@@ par@@ ed us for what happened after that ."
"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing us from all over the country , as@@ king us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated .
"So I changed my im@@ medi@@ ate go@@ al to 1@@ 0,000 fac@@ es ."
"That video was made in the sp@@ r@@ ing of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have tra@@ vel@@ ed to almost 20 cities and photograp@@ h@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a min@@ u@@ te of just qu@@ i@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thous@@ and words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary ."
"So after tra@@ vel@@ ing and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a or sm@@ all@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found evi@@ dence that the ini@@ ti@@ al pre@@ mi@@ se was de@@ ad on ."
V@@ i@@ si@@ bility really is key .
F@@ a@@ mi@@ li@@ ar@@ ity really is the g@@ ate@@ way dru@@ g to emp@@ a@@ thy .
"O@@ n@@ ce an issu@@ e pop@@ s up in your own b@@ ack@@ y@@ ard or am@@ on@@ g@@ st your own family , you &apos;re far more like@@ ly to expl@@ ore sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thy for it or expl@@ ore a new per@@ spec@@ tive on it ."
"O@@ f course , in my tra@@ vel@@ s I met people who le@@ g@@ ally di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed their children for being other than stra@@ ight , but I also met people who were S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts who s@@ wit@@ ched ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es because their child was a le@@ s@@ bi@@ an ."
S@@ par@@ king emp@@ a@@ thy had become the b@@ ack@@ b@@ one of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was star@@ ting to learn that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differ@@ ences between us .
"In fact , on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it high@@ li@@ ghts them ."
"It pres@@ ents , not just the comple@@ x@@ i@@ ties found in a pro@@ c@@ es@@ sion of different human be@@ ings , but the comple@@ x@@ i@@ ties found within each individu@@ al person ."
"It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"A@@ t some point I realized that my mis@@ sion to photograp@@ h &quot; &quot; ga@@ ys &quot; &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently f@@ la@@ wed , because there were a million different sha@@ des of g@@ ay ."
"H@@ ere I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to a@@ vo@@ id — yet another box ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the re@@ lease form that asked people to qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent g@@ ay .
And I wat@@ ched so many ex@@ ist@@ ential cri@@ ses un@@ fo@@ ld in front of me .
( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been pre@@ sen@@ ted with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y your op@@ en@@ ness ?
"O@@ n@@ ce they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 70 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks ."
"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ por@@ tion of people identi@@ fied as something that was much more n@@ u@@ anc@@ ed ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spec@@ tr@@ um of what I have come to re@@ f@@ er to as &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be cle@@ ar though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ ss the issu@@ e of cho@@ ice ver@@ su@@ s bio@@ logical im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the belie@@ f that se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ en@@ tation is a cho@@ ice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge system is this : If you have g@@ ay people over here and you have stra@@ ight people over here , and while we recogn@@ ize that most people identi@@ f@@ y as some@@ where clos@@ er to one b@@ in@@ ary or another , there is this va@@ st spec@@ tr@@ um of people that ex@@ ist in between ."
And the reality that this pres@@ ents is a comp@@ li@@ cated one .
"Because , for example , if you pas@@ s a la@@ w that allo@@ ws a b@@ os@@ s to fir@@ e an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ e for h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al behavi@@ or , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two he@@ ter@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
Wh@@ ere exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss ci@@ tiz@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my tra@@ vel@@ s is just what a poor b@@ in@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ en@@ tation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ vel@@ ing so much and me@@ e@@ ting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and D@@ e@@ mo@@ cr@@ ats and Re@@ publi@@ c@@ ans and jo@@ cks and qu@@ e@@ ens and every other pol@@ ar@@ ization you can pos@@ si@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human r@@ ace ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one le@@ g@@ al hand ti@@ ed behind our b@@ ac@@ ks , and once you get past the shar@@ ed n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and str@@ ug@@ gle , just being other than stra@@ ight doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the end@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it hop@@ e@@ fully appe@@ ar@@ s across more and more pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms , b@@ us sh@@ el@@ ters , b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book p@@ ages , scre@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , perhaps in wat@@ ching this pro@@ c@@ es@@ sion of human@@ ity , something interesting and u@@ se@@ ful will beg@@ in to happen ."
"H@@ op@@ e@@ fully these ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies , these b@@ in@@ ar@@ ies , these over@@ -@@ simp@@ li@@ fied bo@@ x@@ es will beg@@ in to become us@@ el@@ ess and they &apos;ll beg@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they descri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their mul@@ ti@@ p@@ li@@ city .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me partic@@ ul@@ arly that you would cho@@ ose to den@@ y the right to h@@ ous@@ ing , the right to ad@@ op@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the f@@ ree@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to di@@ so@@ wn as your child or your bro@@ ther or your si@@ ster or your mother or your father , your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , your cou@@ s@@ in , your un@@ cle , the pre@@ si@@ dent , your poli@@ ce woman or the fi@@ re@@ man ?"
It &apos;s too l@@ ate .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So p@@ lease don &apos;t gre@@ et us as str@@ ang@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , per@@ i@@ od ."
Thank you .

"We started talking about s@@ la@@ very , and really , I started learning about s@@ la@@ very , for I had cer@@ tain@@ ly known it ex@@ ist@@ ed in the world , but not to such a de@@ gre@@ e ."
"A@@ f@@ ter we fin@@ i@@ shed talking , I felt so hor@@ ri@@ ble and hon@@ est@@ ly as@@ ha@@ med at my own l@@ ack of knowle@@ dge of this at@@ ro@@ city in my own li@@ fe@@ time , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?"

Th@@ us began my jour@@ ney into mo@@ der@@ n day s@@ la@@ very .
"O@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before ."
S@@ ome I even consi@@ der@@ ed like my second home .
"But this time , I would see the sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons hi@@ dd@@ en in the clos@@ et ."
A con@@ serv@@ ative es@@ tim@@ ate t@@ ells us there are more than 2@@ 7 million people en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the world today .
That &apos;s d@@ ou@@ ble the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic s@@ la@@ ve tra@@ de .
"A hund@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , an ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tur@@ al s@@ la@@ ve cost about three times the an@@ n@@ u@@ al s@@ al@@ ary of an American wor@@ ker ."
"That equ@@ ates to about $ 5@@ 0,000 in today &apos;s money ."
"@@ Y@@ et today , entire fami@@ lies can be en@@ s@@ la@@ ved for gener@@ ations over a de@@ b@@ t as small as $ 1@@ 8 ."
"A@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly , s@@ la@@ very gener@@ ates prof@@ its of more than $ 1@@ 3 billion wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de each year ."
"M@@ any have been tri@@ c@@ ked by f@@ al@@ se pr@@ om@@ is@@ es of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to work without pay under the thre@@ at of viol@@ ence , and they cannot walk away ."
"T@@ o@@ day &apos;s s@@ la@@ very is about comm@@ er@@ ce , so the go@@ o@@ ds that en@@ s@@ la@@ ved people pro@@ duce have val@@ ue , but the people produc@@ ing them are di@@ sp@@ os@@ able ."
"S@@ la@@ very ex@@ i@@ sts every@@ where , ne@@ arly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ le@@ g@@ al every@@ where in the world ."
"In In@@ dia and N@@ ep@@ al , I was int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to the bri@@ ck k@@ il@@ ns ."
This str@@ an@@ ge and aw@@ es@@ ome si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into anci@@ ent E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or D@@ an@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"E@@ n@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire fami@@ lies in fact , were c@@ lo@@ a@@ ked in a hea@@ v@@ y bl@@ an@@ k@@ et of d@@ ust , while m@@ ech@@ an@@ ic@@ ally st@@ ac@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 1@@ 8 at a time , and car@@ r@@ ying them from the sc@@ or@@ ching k@@ il@@ ns to tr@@ uc@@ ks hund@@ reds of y@@ ar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ ea@@ den@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion , they work si@@ l@@ ently , doing this t@@ ask over and over for 1@@ 6 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no brea@@ ks for food , no water brea@@ ks , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ ential ."
So per@@ va@@ sive was the he@@ at and the d@@ ust that my camer@@ a became too h@@ ot to even tou@@ ch and ce@@ ased working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my camer@@ a is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ack in the k@@ il@@ ns , I wanted to c@@ ry , but the ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that .

I couldn &apos;t off@@ er them any direc@@ t help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a ci@@ tiz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se situ@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to re@@ ly on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tru@@ sted that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ brea@@ k ."
"In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , I found children car@@ r@@ ying st@@ one for mil@@ es down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tr@@ uc@@ ks wa@@ iting at ro@@ a@@ ds b@@ el@@ ow ."
"The big sh@@ e@@ ets of s@@ l@@ ate were hea@@ vi@@ er than the children car@@ r@@ ying them , and the kids ho@@ ist@@ ed them from their hea@@ ds using these h@@ and@@ made har@@ ne@@ ss@@ es of sti@@ cks and rop@@ e and t@@ or@@ n cl@@ ot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing .
"@@ How can we aff@@ ect something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ va@@ sive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ s@@ la@@ ved , people working 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ ers cla@@ im@@ ed their f@@ ree@@ dom , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their h@@ ous@@ es ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cen@@ ter r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ i@@ sts on the ground help@@ ed them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry lease of their own , so that now they do the same b@@ ack@@ -@@ brea@@ king work , but they do it for themselves , and they get pa@@ id for it , and they do it in f@@ ree@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word s@@ la@@ very , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ fe@@ ly within this particular indu@@ stry ."
"In K@@ a@@ th@@ m@@ and@@ u , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x s@@ la@@ ves themselves ."
"They u@@ sh@@ ered me down a n@@ ar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this di@@ r@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent li@@ t ba@@ se@@ ment ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ ues for for@@ c@@ ed pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , pri@@ v@@ ate ro@@ om@@ s , where the s@@ la@@ ves , women , along with young gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys , some as young as seven years old , are for@@ c@@ ed to en@@ ter@@ tain the c@@ li@@ ents , enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ging them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is d@@ ark and din@@ gy , identi@@ fied with a pa@@ in@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and par@@ ti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ w@@ ood and a cur@@ tain ."
The wor@@ kers here often end@@ ure tra@@ gi@@ c se@@ x@@ u@@ al ab@@ use at the hands of their cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers .
"S@@ t@@ anding in the ne@@ ar d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness , I remember feel@@ ing this quic@@ k , h@@ ot f@@ ear , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ app@@ ed in that h@@ ell ."
I had only one way out : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to clim@@ b through .
"Th@@ ese people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ ject , it &apos;s important to not@@ e that s@@ la@@ very , inclu@@ ding se@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own b@@ ack@@ y@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hund@@ reds of people are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in ag@@ ri@@ culture , in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants , in dom@@ es@@ tic serv@@ it@@ u@@ de , and the li@@ st can go on ."
"@@ R@@ ec@@ ently , the New York T@@ im@@ es re@@ por@@ ted that between 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are so@@ ld into se@@ x s@@ la@@ very every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The t@@ ex@@ ti@@ le indu@@ stry is another one we often think of when we hear about s@@ la@@ ve l@@ ab@@ or .
I vi@@ s@@ ited v@@ il@@ la@@ ges in In@@ dia where entire fami@@ lies were en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the si@@ l@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
"The d@@ yed black hands are the father , while the bl@@ ue and red hands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x d@@ y@@ e in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the si@@ l@@ k into the li@@ qu@@ id up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ y@@ e is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"@@ &quot; &quot; We have no f@@ ree@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get pa@@ id for our d@@ y@@ e@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s es@@ tim@@ ated that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved on L@@ a@@ ke V@@ ol@@ t@@ a , the lar@@ gest man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ ri@@ ved , I went to have a quic@@ k look ."
"I saw what se@@ em@@ ed to be a family fi@@ shing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ s@@ la@@ ved .
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their fami@@ lies and tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked and v@@ an@@ i@@ shed , and they &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m ."
This young child is e@@ ight years old .
"He was tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tin@@ y can@@ o@@ e ."
He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .
"The sk@@ el@@ et@@ al t@@ ree lim@@ b@@ s sub@@ mer@@ ged in L@@ a@@ ke V@@ ol@@ t@@ a often ca@@ t@@ ch the fi@@ shing ne@@ ts , and w@@ ear@@ y , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed children are th@@ ro@@ wn into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the l@@ ines ."
M@@ any of them dro@@ wn .
"For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been for@@ c@@ ed to work on the la@@ ke ."
"T@@ er@@ ri@@ fied of his ma@@ ster , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been tre@@ ated with c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger s@@ la@@ ves that he man@@ ages ."
"I met these bo@@ ys at five in the mor@@ ning , when they were ha@@ ul@@ ing in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ in the co@@ ld , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to not@@ e that these ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh more than a thous@@ and p@@ ounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to int@@ ro@@ duce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed from a fi@@ shing v@@ il@@ la@@ ge .
I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ates v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of s@@ la@@ very .
"H@@ ere he &apos;s seen taking a b@@ ath at the well , p@@ our@@ ing big b@@ uc@@ ke@@ ts of water over his head , and the wonder@@ ful news is , as you and I are sit@@ ting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given to@@ ols to make a living and to keep their children sa@@ fe ."
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of pos@@ si@@ bility .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a st@@ and and made a difference in his life ?
"D@@ ri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad in G@@ h@@ an@@ a with par@@ t@@ n@@ ers of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , a fel@@ low ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a m@@ op@@ ed su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly sp@@ ed up to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er and t@@ app@@ ed on the win@@ d@@ ow ."
He told us to fol@@ low him down a di@@ r@@ t ro@@ ad into the j@@ un@@ gle .
"A@@ t the end of the ro@@ ad , he ur@@ ged us out of the car , and told the dri@@ ver to quickly leave ."
"Th@@ en he po@@ in@@ ted to@@ ward this b@@ are@@ ly vi@@ sible fo@@ ot@@ p@@ ath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the p@@ ath , this is the p@@ ath . G@@ o . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we started down the p@@ ath , we pu@@ shed a@@ side the v@@ ines blo@@ c@@ king the way , and after about an h@@ our of wal@@ king in , found that the tra@@ il had become f@@ loo@@ ded by rec@@ ent ra@@ ins , so I ho@@ ist@@ ed the phot@@ o ge@@ ar ab@@ o@@ ve my head as we de@@ sc@@ en@@ ded into these wat@@ ers up to my ch@@ est ."
"A@@ f@@ ter another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly en@@ ded at a c@@ lear@@ ing , and before us was a ma@@ ss of hol@@ es that could f@@ it into the size of a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all field , and all of them were full of en@@ s@@ la@@ ved people l@@ ab@@ or@@ ing ."
"M@@ any women had children str@@ app@@ ed to their b@@ ac@@ ks while they were p@@ an@@ ning for go@@ ld , w@@ ad@@ ing in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cur@@ y ."
M@@ er@@ cur@@ y is used in the ex@@ tr@@ action process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in a m@@ ine sha@@ ft in another part of G@@ h@@ an@@ a .
"When they came out of the sha@@ ft , they were so@@ a@@ king w@@ et from their own s@@ we@@ at ."
"I remember looking into their ti@@ red , bloo@@ d@@ sho@@ t eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 7@@ 2 hours ."
"The sha@@ f@@ ts are up to 3@@ 00 fe@@ et de@@ ep , and they car@@ ry out hea@@ v@@ y ba@@ gs of st@@ one that later will be transp@@ or@@ ted to another are@@ a , where the st@@ one will be p@@ oun@@ ded so that they can ex@@ tr@@ act the go@@ ld ."
"A@@ t first gl@@ ance , the p@@ oun@@ ding s@@ ite see@@ ms full of powerful men , but when we look clos@@ er , we see some less for@@ tun@@ ate working on the f@@ r@@ ing@@ es , and children too ."
"A@@ ll of them are v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m to in@@ j@@ ury , ill@@ ness and viol@@ ence ."
"In fact , it &apos;s very like@@ ly that this m@@ us@@ cu@@ lar person will end up like this one here , r@@ ac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is and mer@@ cur@@ y po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years ."
"This is M@@ an@@ ur@@ u . Wh@@ en his father died , his un@@ cle tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es ."
"When his un@@ cle died , M@@ an@@ ur@@ u in@@ her@@ ited his un@@ cle &apos;s de@@ b@@ t , which f@@ ur@@ ther for@@ c@@ ed him into being en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the min@@ es ."
"When I met him , he had been working in the min@@ es for 14 years , and the le@@ g in@@ j@@ ury that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing ac@@ ci@@ dent , one so se@@ v@@ ere doc@@ tors say his le@@ g should be a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated ."
"O@@ n top of that , M@@ an@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is , yet he &apos;s still for@@ c@@ ed to work day in and day out in that m@@ ine sha@@ ft ."
"E@@ ven still , he has a dre@@ am that he will become free and become edu@@ cated with the help of lo@@ cal acti@@ vi@@ sts like F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , and it &apos;s this sort of de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , in the face of un@@ ima@@ gin@@ able o@@ d@@ ds , that f@@ ill@@ s me with comple@@ te a@@ we ."
I want to sh@@ ine a light on s@@ la@@ very .
"When I was working in the field , I b@@ rought lots of c@@ and@@ les with me , and with the help of my inter@@ pre@@ ter , I imp@@ ar@@ ted to the people I was photograp@@ h@@ ing that I wanted to ill@@ um@@ in@@ ate their stories and their p@@ light , so when it was sa@@ fe for them , and sa@@ fe for me , I made these images ."
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
"I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ ar@@ ing wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do wh@@ ate@@ ver we can to help make a difference in their lives ."
"I tru@@ ly believe , if we can see one another as fel@@ low human be@@ ings , then it be@@ comes very difficult to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate at@@ ro@@ cities like s@@ la@@ very ."
"Th@@ ese images are not of issu@@ es . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all de@@ ser@@ ving of the same ri@@ ghts , di@@ gn@@ ity and resp@@ ect in their lives ."
"There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mi@@ stre@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous hon@@ or of me@@ e@@ ting ."
"I hope that these images a@@ wa@@ ken a for@@ ce in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that for@@ ce will i@@ gn@@ ite a fir@@ e , and that fir@@ e will sh@@ ine a light on s@@ la@@ very , for without that light , the be@@ ast of b@@ on@@ d@@ age can contin@@ ue to live in the sha@@ do@@ ws ."

So I develop@@ ed a whole ran@@ ge around — ma@@ ss@@ -@@ produc@@ ed ran@@ ge — that obvi@@ ously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er@@ -@@ end dec@@ or market that could be exp@@ or@@ ted and also serv@@ ice our lo@@ cal market .
"We started exper@@ im@@ en@@ ting , as you can see , in terms of sh@@ ap@@ es , for@@ ms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pe@@ t project .

"This is our group , our ma@@ in group of w@@ ea@@ ver@@ s ."
They come on a wee@@ kly b@@ as@@ is to D@@ ur@@ b@@ an .
They all have b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all mo@@ ved back to the r@@ ural are@@ a where they came from .
It &apos;s a wee@@ kly tur@@ n@@ around of produc@@ tion .
This is the community that I ori@@ gin@@ ally sho@@ wed you the sli@@ de of .
"And that &apos;s also mo@@ der@@ n@@ ized today , and it &apos;s supp@@ or@@ ting work for 3@@ 00 w@@ ea@@ ver@@ s ."
And the rest says it all .

"In an age of global stri@@ fe and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is se@@ x so d@@ am@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ack in univer@@ sity , we had a quic@@ k project to design some sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s my c@@ lo@@ ck .
"It uses something called the d@@ war@@ f s@@ un@@ flo@@ wer , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ch@@ es in he@@ ight ."
"Now , as you know , s@@ un@@ flo@@ w@@ ers tr@@ ack the su@@ n during the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which direc@@ tion the s@@ un@@ flo@@ wer is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the bl@@ ank are@@ a in the ba@@ se ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed pos@@ ition of the s@@ un@@ flo@@ wer , and in the ev@@ ening again , and that &apos;s your c@@ lo@@ ck ."
"Now , I know my c@@ lo@@ ck doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a flo@@ wer ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ ased , sub@@ j@@ ective op@@ ini@@ on , it &apos;s bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck ."
It &apos;s five ma@@ gn@@ i@@ f@@ ying g@@ la@@ ss@@ es with a sho@@ t g@@ la@@ ss under each one .
In each sho@@ t g@@ la@@ ss is a different sc@@ en@@ ted o@@ il .
"In the mor@@ ning , the s@@ un@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first ma@@ gn@@ i@@ f@@ ying g@@ la@@ ss , foc@@ using a be@@ am of light on the sho@@ t g@@ la@@ ss under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the sc@@ en@@ ted o@@ il inside , and a particular sm@@ ell will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different sm@@ ells are dis@@ pers@@ ed throu@@ gh@@ out that environment ."
An@@ y@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the sm@@ ell .
You can see why I h@@ ate Ch@@ r@@ is .
One thing you have to know about me is I h@@ ate to l@@ ose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ g@@ ging me for well over a deca@@ de .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the so@@ lar power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks project , a young la@@ dy I knew su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ ences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"T@@ o do this , I de@@ vi@@ sed something called the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y-@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have a scale from z@@ er@@ o to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ time I had a mem@@ or@@ able experience in my life , I would rec@@ ord it on this grap@@ h like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a quic@@ k video to show you how it works .
"B@@ i@@ ke design@@ er : This is &#91; un@@ cle@@ ar &#93; , cu@@ st@@ om bi@@ ke design@@ er ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; S@@ m@@ ell &#93; &#91; T@@ a@@ st@@ e &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h works .
So here are some other resul@@ ts .
The first is for inst@@ ant no@@ o@@ d@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , ta@@ st@@ e and sm@@ ell are quite high , but not@@ ice sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) N@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , clu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do h@@ an@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mo@@ king ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mo@@ kers told me the sen@@ sa@@ tion of hol@@ ding a ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ te and br@@ ing@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mo@@ king experience , which sho@@ ws , it &apos;s kind of sc@@ ary to think how well ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es are design@@ ed by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the per@@ f@@ ect experience look like on the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ?"
"It would , of course , be a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as in@@ ten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the per@@ f@@ ect one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . G@@ re@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ esp@@ on@@ d@@ ents said that great se@@ x h@@ its all of the five sen@@ ses at an extre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help expla@@ in why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks project from my y@@ outh ."
And I realized this the@@ ory also expla@@ ins why Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck is so much better than m@@ ine .
"You see , my c@@ lo@@ ck only foc@@ uses on si@@ ght , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck .
It &apos;s the first c@@ lo@@ ck ever that uses sm@@ ell to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck is a re@@ v@@ olution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory ta@@ ught me about my field .
"You see , up ti@@ ll now , us design@@ ers , we &apos;ve ma@@ in@@ ly foc@@ used on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve i@@ g@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck sho@@ ws us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant produc@@ t .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory in all of our design@@ s ?
Here &apos;s three quic@@ k ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ fu@@ mat@@ or . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I br@@ us@@ h my te@@ e@@ th tw@@ ice a day , and what if we had a too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h that ta@@ st@@ es like can@@ dy , and when the ta@@ st@@ e of can@@ dy r@@ an out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a flu@@ te or a cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pre@@ ss down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the flu@@ te or the cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ str@@ u@@ ment I do play : the t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion re@@ m@@ ote control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll not@@ ice that the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I real@@ ize the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emoti@@ ons and that el@@ usi@@ ve x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
Ma@@ ybe that could be the t@@ op@@ ic of my next talk .
"@@ Un@@ til then , p@@ lease have fu@@ n using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own design@@ s ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
All right .

"( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) I see@@ k re@@ fu@@ ge in Al@@ la@@ h from cur@@ sed S@@ at@@ an . In the N@@ a@@ me of Al@@ la@@ h , the most G@@ r@@ ac@@ i@@ ous , the most M@@ er@@ ci@@ ful ."
( Eng@@ lish ) I was born in a middle cla@@ ss family .
"M@@ y father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man ."
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a bo@@ y or a gir@@ l : they were going to go to school .
So I gu@@ ess I was the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y one .
My mother had 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ anci@@ es .
"F@@ rom 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ anci@@ es , five of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
"D@@ ay to day , I wat@@ ched women being car@@ ri@@ ed to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , or wat@@ ched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard ."
"A@@ t that time , when I fin@@ i@@ shed my high school , I really wanted to be a doc@@ tor ."
I wanted to be a doc@@ tor to help women and children .
"So I comple@@ ted my education , but I wanted to go to univer@@ sity ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a d@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ ory for gir@@ ls , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in medi@@ cal school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a resul@@ t , my father s@@ ent me to America ."
I came to America .
I comple@@ ted my education .
"W@@ hi@@ le I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was inv@@ ad@@ ed by R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
"And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country ."
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p .
"So as so@@ on as I comple@@ ted my education , I b@@ rought my family to America ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an .
"D@@ ay after day , when I list@@ en@@ ed to the news , when I follo@@ wed what was going on with my country , my heart was brea@@ king up ."
"I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me ."
I had a good job .
I was a prof@@ ess@@ or at a univer@@ sity .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p .
"And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"A@@ b@@ out 9@@ 0 percent of them were women and children . M@@ ost of the men have been kill@@ ed or they were in war . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p ,@@ "
"@@ when I went da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ v@@ ey , I found things you never could imagine ."
I saw a wi@@ d@@ ow with five to e@@ ight children sit@@ ting there and wee@@ p@@ ing and not kno@@ wing what to do .
"I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live ."
"I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supp@@ or@@ ting the family as a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old bo@@ y — being the head of the h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ old , trying to prot@@ ect their si@@ ster and their mother and their children ."
So it was a very de@@ va@@ st@@ ating situ@@ ation .
"M@@ y heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do ."
"A@@ t that moment , we talk about mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m ."
"A@@ t that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
"But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life ."
It trans@@ form@@ ed me . It gave me st@@ at@@ us .
It gave me con@@ fi@@ dence . It gave me a care@@ er .
"It help@@ ed me to supp@@ ort my family , to bring my family to another country , to be sa@@ fe ."
"And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after ."
But do you think it was easy ?
"N@@ o , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls , completely ."
"And also , by R@@ us@@ si@@ a inv@@ ad@@ ing A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , people were not tru@@ sting any@@ one ."
"It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I ?"
S@@ ome@@ body who comes from the United States .
S@@ ome@@ body who got edu@@ cated here .
D@@ id they tr@@ ust me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really needed to build the tr@@ ust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ yed and looked and looked .
I asked .
"F@@ in@@ ally , I found one man ."
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his t@@ ent in the ca@@ m@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot;"
"And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y woman , cra@@ z@@ y woman , how do you think I can be a te@@ ac@@ her ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot; &quot; F@@ in@@ ally , he ac@@ cep@@ ted my off@@ er , and once I started a cla@@ ss in his comp@@ ound , the word sp@@ read all over ."
"In a matter of one year , we had 25 sch@@ o@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing ."
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
"But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving te@@ ac@@ her tra@@ ining . We were tra@@ ining women &apos;s ri@@ ghts , human ri@@ ghts , demo@@ cr@@ acy , ru@@ le of la@@ w . We were giving all kinds of tra@@ ining . And one day , I tell you ,@@ "
"@@ one day I was in the off@@ ice in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"A@@ ll of a su@@ dd@@ en , I saw my st@@ af@@ f run@@ ning to ro@@ om@@ s and lo@@ c@@ king the do@@ ors and telling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ u@@ n away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a lead@@ er , what do you do ?"
You &apos;re sc@@ ar@@ ed . You know it &apos;s d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
"But as a lead@@ er , you have to h@@ old it together ."
You have to h@@ old it together and show str@@ eng@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were p@@ our@@ ing into my off@@ ice ."
So I inv@@ ited them to the off@@ ice .
"They came , and there were n@@ ine of them — n@@ ine T@@ ali@@ b@@ an ."
They were the ug@@ li@@ est looking men you can ever see .
"( Laughter ) V@@ ery me@@ an@@ -@@ looking people , black c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , black tur@@ b@@ an , and they p@@ our into my off@@ ice ."
And I inv@@ ited them to have a se@@ at and have te@@ a .
They said no . They are not going to dr@@ ink te@@ a .
"And of course , with the t@@ one of vo@@ ice they were using , it was very sc@@ ary , but I was really sha@@ king up ."
"But also I was str@@ ong , hol@@ ding myself up ."
"And , of course , by that time , you know how I dre@@ ss — I dre@@ ss from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ j@@ a@@ b ."
"The only thing you could see , my eyes ."
"They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?"
D@@ on &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls ?
"What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Wh@@ ere is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teach@@ ing gir@@ ls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody ."
"We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ or@@ an , H@@ o@@ ly B@@ oo@@ k ."
"And you know , K@@ or@@ an says that if you learn the H@@ o@@ ly B@@ oo@@ k , the woman , they can be a good wi@@ fe , and they can o@@ be@@ y their h@@ us@@ b@@ and . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started spea@@ king P@@ a@@ sh@@ to ."
"They tal@@ ked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s O@@ K . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I off@@ ered them te@@ a again , and they took a si@@ p and they left ."
"B@@ y that time , my st@@ af@@ f p@@ ou@@ red into my off@@ ice ."
They were sc@@ ar@@ ed to de@@ ath .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t k@@ ill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
"@@ V@@ ery happy , and I was happy to be ali@@ ve , of course ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ f course , I was happy to be ali@@ ve ."
"But also , as we contin@@ u@@ ously gave tra@@ ining during the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an — of course during the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an there is another story ."
"We went under@@ ground and we provi@@ ded education for 80 sch@@ o@@ ol@@ gir@@ ls , 3@@ ,000 students under@@ ground , and contin@@ u@@ ously we tra@@ ined ."
"W@@ ith the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , we went into the country , and we op@@ en@@ ed school after school ."
We op@@ en@@ ed women &apos;s learning cen@@ ter .
We contin@@ u@@ ously op@@ en@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ics .
We worked with mo@@ thers and children .
We had re@@ produc@@ tive health tra@@ ining .
We had all kinds of tra@@ ining that you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up nor@@ th of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and all of a su@@ dd@@ en , again , I was st@@ opp@@ ed in the middle of the ro@@ ad by 1@@ 9 young men ."
"@@ R@@ i@@ f@@ les on their sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , they blo@@ c@@ ked the ro@@ ad ."
"And I told my dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the dri@@ ver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you ."
"What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing . &quot; &quot; They called my name ."
"And by that time , the women are y@@ elling and scre@@ am@@ ing inside the car ."
"I am very sha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it ."
"This time , we all are going to be kill@@ ed ."
There is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my mind .
"But still , the moment comes , and you take str@@ eng@@ th from wh@@ ate@@ ver you believe and wh@@ ate@@ ver you do ."
It &apos;s in your heart .
"You believe in your wor@@ th , and you can walk on it ."
So I just h@@ old myself on the side of the car .
"M@@ y le@@ g was sha@@ king , and I got outside ."
"And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?"
"They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are ."
We know where you are going .
E@@ very day you go up nor@@ th here and there .
"You tra@@ in women , you te@@ ach them and also you give them an opport@@ unity to have a job ."
"You build their sk@@ ill@@ s . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?"
"What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s O@@ K ."
"The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just h@@ old the gu@@ n and k@@ ill ."
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
"It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course ."
"So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I wal@@ ked into the car , I s@@ it in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; T@@ ur@@ n around and go back to the off@@ ice . &quot; &quot; A@@ t that time , we only were supp@@ or@@ ting gir@@ ls ."
"We only had money for women to tra@@ in them , to s@@ end them to school , and nothing else ."
"B@@ y the time I came to the off@@ ice , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were g@@ one ."
They r@@ an away home . N@@ o@@ body sta@@ yed there .
"M@@ y bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was completely g@@ one ."
"I was sha@@ ken up , and I s@@ at on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?"
Because we had tra@@ ining going on up nor@@ th already .
H@@ und@@ reds of women were there coming to get tra@@ ining .
"So I was sit@@ ting there , all of a su@@ dd@@ en , at this moment , talking about mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m , we are , at that moment , one of my wonder@@ ful d@@ on@@ ors called me about a re@@ p@@ ort ."
"And she asked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ a@@ k@@ en@@ a ? &quot; &quot; And I ans@@ wer@@ ed her ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing . &quot; &quot; I tried to co@@ ver ."
"N@@ o matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again ."
"@@ &quot; O@@ K , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
I told her the whole story .
"A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , you go next time , and you will help them ."
"You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same rou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back f@@ ur@@ ther , the same young men , st@@ anding up there and hol@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and po@@ in@@ ting to us to stop the car ."
So we st@@ opp@@ ed the car .
"I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n one condi@@ tion , that wh@@ ate@@ ver I say , you ac@@ cept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , y@@ es , they do ."
"So I took them to the m@@ os@@ que , and to make a long story sh@@ ort , I told them I &apos;d give them teach@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers ."
"They learn Eng@@ lish , they learn how to be teach@@ ers , they learn compu@@ ters , and they are my gu@@ i@@ des ."
"E@@ very are@@ a that is un@@ known to us in the m@@ oun@@ tain are@@ as , they go with me . They are a@@ head , and we go ."
And they prot@@ ect us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That t@@ ells you that education trans@@ for@@ ms people .
"When you edu@@ cate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gen@@ der equ@@ ality ."
"We cannot only tra@@ in women but for@@ get about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the har@@ de@@ st time ."
"( Laughter ) So we started tra@@ ining men because the men should know the pot@@ ential of women , know how much these pot@@ ential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing ."
"So we are contin@@ u@@ ously giving tra@@ ining to men , and I really believe str@@ on@@ g@@ ly ."
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
"It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country ."
We were going every@@ where .
"W@@ om@@ en were getting education : la@@ w@@ y@@ er , engine@@ er , te@@ ac@@ her , and we were going from house to house ."
We never lo@@ c@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But you know what happened to my country .
"T@@ o@@ day , people cannot walk out of their do@@ or without sec@@ ur@@ ity issu@@ es ."
But we want the same A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
"T@@ o@@ day , the women of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an are working very , very hard ."
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ ining to be la@@ w@@ y@@ ers .
"They are tra@@ ining to be doc@@ tors , back again ."
"They are tra@@ ining to be teach@@ ers , and they are run@@ ning bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"So it is so wonder@@ ful to see people like that re@@ ach their comple@@ te pot@@ ential , and all of this is going to happen ."
"I want to share this with you , because of love , because of comp@@ as@@ sion , and because of tr@@ ust and hon@@ est@@ y ."
"If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ comp@@ lish ."
"We have one po@@ et , Ma@@ w@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī ."
"He said that by having comp@@ as@@ sion and having love , you can con@@ qu@@ er the world ."
"And I tell you , we could ."
"And if we could do it in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world ."
"Th@@ ank you very , very much ."

"This is where I live . I live in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , at the s@@ outh parts of the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ark ."
"Th@@ ose are my d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ark ."
"N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ark is not f@@ enc@@ ed in the s@@ outh wi@@ de@@ ly , which means wi@@ ld animals like z@@ e@@ br@@ as mi@@ gr@@ ate out of the par@@ k f@@ ree@@ ly ."
"So pre@@ dat@@ ors like li@@ ons fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ ve@@ st@@ o@@ ck .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was kill@@ ed at night , and I just w@@ o@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only b@@ ul@@ l we had ."
"M@@ y community , the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ i , we believe that we came from hea@@ ven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we val@@ ue them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up h@@ ating li@@ ons so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prot@@ ect our community and the li@@ ve@@ st@@ o@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the six li@@ ons which were kill@@ ed in N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i .
And I think this is why the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ark li@@ ons are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ sible for his d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fir@@ e , because I thought li@@ ons were sc@@ ar@@ ed of fir@@ e ."
"But I came to real@@ ize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even help@@ ing the li@@ ons to see through the co@@ w@@ shed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ ar@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to tri@@ ck the li@@ ons &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was st@@ anding ne@@ ar the co@@ w@@ shed .
"But li@@ ons are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the sc@@ ar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he ju@@ mp@@ s in and kill@@ s the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed with a t@@ or@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that li@@ ons are af@@ ra@@ id of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ ince I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new radi@@ o , and that day she almost kill@@ ed me , but I learned a lot about elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car b@@ at@@ ter@@ y , an in@@ di@@ ca@@ tor box . It &apos;s a small dev@@ ice found in a m@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps m@@ ot@@ ori@@ sts when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small t@@ or@@ ch from a bro@@ ken f@@ la@@ sh@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the so@@ lar p@@ an@@ el char@@ ges the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y , and the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y supp@@ lies the power to the small in@@ di@@ ca@@ tor box . I call it a trans@@ form@@ er ."
And the in@@ di@@ ca@@ tor box makes the li@@ ghts f@@ la@@ sh .
"As you can see , the b@@ ul@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts f@@ la@@ sh and tri@@ ck the li@@ ons into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ enc@@ ed any problem with li@@ ons ."
And my ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing h@@ om@@ es heard about this idea .
One of them was this gr@@ and@@ mother .
"S@@ he had a lot of her animals being kill@@ ed by li@@ ons , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the li@@ on li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ ince now , I &apos;ve set up seven h@@ om@@ es around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over K@@ en@@ y@@ a for sc@@ ar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ ph@@ ants away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inv@@ en@@ tion , I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best sch@@ o@@ ols in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ house Inter@@ national S@@ ch@@ ool , and I &apos;m really exc@@ ited about this ."
My new school now is coming in and help@@ ing by fund@@ ra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing the li@@ ghts to the h@@ om@@ es which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sa@@ v@@ an@@ n@@ a gra@@ ss@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an a@@ ir@@ cra@@ ft engine@@ er and pi@@ lot when I grow up .
"I used to h@@ ate li@@ ons , but now because my inv@@ en@@ tion is sa@@ ving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the li@@ ons , we are able to st@@ ay with the li@@ ons without any conf@@ lic@@ t ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , th@@ ank you very much ."
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : You have no idea how exc@@ iting it is to hear a story like y@@ ours .
So you got this sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ .@@ R@@ ic@@ hard T@@ ur@@ ere : Y@@ ep .
C@@ A : You &apos;re working on other electri@@ cal inv@@ en@@ tions .
What &apos;s the next one on your li@@ st ?
"@@ R@@ T : My next inv@@ en@@ tion is , I want to make an electri@@ c f@@ en@@ ce@@ .@@ C@@ A : E@@ l@@ ec@@ tri@@ c f@@ ence ?"
"@@ R@@ T : But I know electri@@ c f@@ ences are already inv@@ en@@ ted , but I want to make m@@ ine ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : You already tried it once , right , and you — R@@ T : I tried it before , but I st@@ opp@@ ed because it gave me a sho@@ ck . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : In the tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es . R@@ ic@@ hard T@@ ur@@ ere , you are something else ."
"We &apos;re going to che@@ er you on every ste@@ p of the way , my friend ."
Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .@@ R@@ T : Thank you . ( Applause )
"@@ J@@ ust ab@@ solu@@ tely amazing , every single di@@ ve ."
D@@ is@@ appe@@ ar@@ s right into the b@@ ack@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s bl@@ u@@ ff@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it b@@ ack@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"You know , one of the in@@ ten@@ se p@@ le@@ as@@ u@@ res of tra@@ vel and one of the deli@@ ghts of e@@ th@@ no@@ grap@@ hi@@ c research is the opport@@ unity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the w@@ ind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in , ta@@ st@@ e it in the b@@ it@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts ."
"@@ J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sha@@ m@@ ans still jour@@ ney be@@ y@@ on@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still re@@ s@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a , the B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ su@@ e the b@@ re@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ m@@ a , is to really remember the cen@@ tr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ solu@@ te sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our l@@ in@@ ea@@ ge made , al@@ be@@ it suc@@ cess@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago ."
"And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves ."
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through ini@@ ti@@ ation r@@ it@@ es .
"We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ ath , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t surpri@@ se us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ que ca@@ dence of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every culture ."
"And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the fore@@ sts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut de@@ ser@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ and@@ er@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ a@@ v@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a — this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the de@@ ser@@ t with a mon@@ th ago — or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ m@@ a , E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss mother of the world ."
"A@@ ll of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ en@@ ting yourself in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope ."
"Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al life and cul@@ tur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the bio@@ logical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here ."
"And you might think of this cul@@ tur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , and you might de@@ f@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here as being the su@@ m t@@ ot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ a@@ ms , my@@ ths , ideas , insp@@ i@@ ra@@ tions , in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions b@@ rought into being by the human ima@@ gin@@ ation since the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
The e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here is human@@ ity &apos;s great le@@ g@@ acy .
It &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ i@@ si@@ tive species .
"And just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here — and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater r@@ ate ."
"N@@ o bio@@ logi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are su@@ g@@ gest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of bio@@ logical di@@ ver@@ sity — sc@@ ar@@ ce@@ ly appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ ver@@ sity ."
"And the great in@@ di@@ ca@@ tor of that , of course , is language l@@ os@@ s ."
"When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages sp@@ o@@ ken on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical r@@ ules ."
A language is a f@@ la@@ sh of the human sp@@ ir@@ it .
It &apos;s a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the materi@@ al world .
"E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ gro@@ w@@ th fore@@ st of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
"And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we s@@ it here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being ta@@ ught to bab@@ ies , which means , eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , un@@ less something chan@@ ges , they &apos;re already de@@ ad ."
"What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in si@@ l@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ dom of the an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors or an@@ tici@@ p@@ ate the pr@@ om@@ ise of the children ?"
"And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ l@@ ab@@ les of an anci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gu@@ e ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be better , w@@ ouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ b@@ a . Let &apos;s make it C@@ an@@ t@@ on@@ ese ."
Let &apos;s make it K@@ o@@ g@@ i . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , a bri@@ e@@ f jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"T@@ a@@ ke , for example , this child of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ d@@ a who believe that my@@ th@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the ea@@ st in the b@@ el@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ kes ."
"Now , this is a people who co@@ gn@@ i@@ ti@@ vely do not dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ v@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the fore@@ st up@@ on which the people dep@@ end ."
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; &quot; l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic ex@@ o@@ ga@@ my : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
"And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ o@@ logical past , yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages sp@@ o@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a language ."
They simply list@@ en and then beg@@ in to speak .
"O@@ r , one of the most f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8 ."
"In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ ar@@ ies at@@ te@@ mp@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cri@@ tical mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
"They dro@@ pp@@ ed from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ s@@ y photograp@@ h@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st had never seen anything tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal in their lives ."
"They pic@@ ked up these photograp@@ h@@ s from the fore@@ st flo@@ or , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and con@@ clu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ ar@@ ies to de@@ ath ."
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
"We trac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back e@@ ight gener@@ ations , and we found two inst@@ anc@@ es of natural de@@ ath and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him any@@ way . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ i@@ ca@@ ci@@ ous knowle@@ dge of the fore@@ st that was a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing ."
Th@@ e@@ ir h@@ un@@ ters could sm@@ ell an@@ ima@@ l ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interest@@ ed in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i , inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t soci@@ e@@ ties which were the f@@ ound@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ out@@ es , and sec@@ uring the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es ."
"In order to make sense out of sen@@ sa@@ tion , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ ith of V@@ o@@ d@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t ."
"O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a comple@@ x me@@ t@@ ap@@ hy@@ si@@ cal wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great reli@@ gi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?"
"@@ Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , Is@@ la@@ m , B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ s@@ m , J@@ u@@ da@@ ism , wh@@ ate@@ ver ."
"There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no reli@@ gi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ sti@@ l@@ lation of these very pro@@ found reli@@ gi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gi@@ c D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a ."
"But , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad ."
"So , the living give bir@@ th to the sp@@ ir@@ its ."
"The sp@@ ir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from b@@ ene@@ ath the G@@ re@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ari@@ ly di@@ sp@@ l@@ ace the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ e@@ f sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d ."
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ i@@ sts like to say that &quot; &quot; You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and speak about G@@ od .
"We d@@ ance in the te@@ mple and become G@@ od . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ se@@ ssed , you are taken by the sp@@ ir@@ it — how can you be har@@ med ?"
"So you see these a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tr@@ ance h@@ and@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ unity , a rather a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when ca@@ tal@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the state of extre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ o@@ g@@ i of the S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ an@@ t@@ a Mar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a ."
"D@@ es@@ c@@ end@@ ants of the anci@@ ent T@@ a@@ ir@@ on@@ a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which once car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ a@@ st@@ al pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated v@@ ol@@ can@@ ic ma@@ ssi@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ a@@ st@@ al pla@@ in ."
"In a bloo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"T@@ o this day , they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a r@@ it@@ u@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ."
"The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es are taken away from their fami@@ lies at the age of three and four , sequ@@ est@@ ered in a sha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the ba@@ se of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ o@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to mi@@ mic the n@@ ine months of ge@@ st@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ic@@ ally in the wom@@ b of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ pos@@ ition that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers alone ma@@ in@@ tain the cos@@ mic — or we might say the ec@@ o@@ logical — b@@ al@@ ance ."
"And at the end of this amazing ini@@ ti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 1@@ 8 , they see a s@@ un@@ ri@@ se . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ u@@ n begin@@ s to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beautiful l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ med in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est ste@@ ps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you ."
"It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prot@@ ect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ sible for de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying the world ."
"Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very important ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its simp@@ li@@ city , or al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ vely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ o@@ rea@@ u and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther s@@ enti@@ mental n@@ or w@@ ea@@ k@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ wa@@ mp@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ be@@ t , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , through time and r@@ it@@ u@@ al , for@@ ged a tra@@ di@@ tional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ sci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ l@@ er in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a prof@@ ound@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that re@@ source or that place than a young k@@ id from M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the fore@@ sts of B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those fore@@ sts ex@@ ist@@ ed to be c@@ ut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a ini@@ ti@@ ation ."
"Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ i@@ ties , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . T@@ a@@ ke this pl@@ ant here ."
It &apos;s a photograp@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l .
"This is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
"What makes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ o@@ logical pot@@ ential of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a ser@@ ies of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ m@@ ine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic — to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of bl@@ ue ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness — but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is ."
"This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ min@@ es , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ m@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ m@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ n@@ u@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ m@@ ine ."
T@@ o have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l l@@ ined with bar@@ o@@ que pa@@ int@@ ings and lan@@ ding on a se@@ a of electri@@ city . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the di@@ ss@@ olution of reality .
"In fact , I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or , R@@ ic@@ hard E@@ v@@ an S@@ h@@ ul@@ t@@ es — who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ che@@ deli@@ c er@@ a with his disco@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you couldn &apos;t cla@@ ssi@@ f@@ y these tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ min@@ es as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ min@@ es is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ i@@ da@@ se ."
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other che@@ mi@@ cal that den@@ at@@ u@@ res the M@@ A@@ O .
"Now , the f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the pre@@ ci@@ se sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ ta@@ m@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question ."
"@@ How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar plan@@ ts , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally un@@ re@@ l@@ ated plan@@ ts that when com@@ b@@ ined in this way , created a kind of bio@@ che@@ mi@@ cal ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the parts ?"
"Well , we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ e@@ mis@@ m , &quot; &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; &quot; which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less ."
"But you ask the In@@ di@@ ans , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plan@@ ts talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?"
"This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the fore@@ st , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one species ."
"And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ lish their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plan@@ ts ."
"I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key ."
"Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ gin@@ s of history as the real world , me@@ an@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on ."
"Well , the tru@@ th is the 20@@ th century , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its techno@@ logical inno@@ v@@ ations , but rather as the er@@ a in which we st@@ ood by and either acti@@ vely end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely ac@@ cep@@ ted the ma@@ ssi@@ ve de@@ struc@@ tion of both bio@@ logical and cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ ver@@ sity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change ."
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ st@@ antly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x In@@ di@@ ans did not stop being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American st@@ opp@@ ed being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ gy .
"It &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here . It is power , the c@@ ru@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you disco@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tures de@@ st@@ ined to fa@@ de away ; these are d@@ y@@ na@@ mic living pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by identi@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation in the h@@ om@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an — a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k — a people who li@@ ved free in the fore@@ st until a gener@@ ation ago , and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to serv@@ it@@ u@@ de and pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s , where you can see the ri@@ ver itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the si@@ l@@ t that see@@ ms to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o a@@ wa@@ y@@ "

"O@@ r if we go into the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of T@@ i@@ be@@ t , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research rec@@ ently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a c@@ ru@@ de face of political dom@@ in@@ ation ."
"You know , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , the physi@@ cal ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the de@@ struc@@ tion of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many qu@@ ar@@ ters , c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment str@@ ate@@ gy ."
And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the ground level .
"I once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ est@@ er@@ n China over@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n T@@ i@@ be@@ t to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a with a young colle@@ ag@@ ue , and it was only when I got to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a that I underst@@ ood the face behind the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s you hear about : 6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents t@@ or@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and a@@ sh@@ es , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people kill@@ ed by the ca@@ dre@@ s during the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ ev@@ olution ."
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a .
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ antly kill@@ ed at the time of the Chin@@ ese inv@@ a@@ sion .
H@@ is un@@ cle fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness in the D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al .

He was sm@@ ug@@ g@@ led into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de b@@ ene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she couldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be without him .

"One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gre@@ s@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard l@@ ab@@ or ."
"The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be imp@@ os@@ sible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive sp@@ ir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ old ."
"And in the end , then , it really comes down to a cho@@ ice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c world of di@@ ver@@ sity ?"

The mo@@ der@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is b@@ are@@ ly 3@@ 00 years old .

"This is a photograp@@ h I took at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Is@@ land when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his gr@@ and@@ father ."

I realized that this was a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
( M@@ usic ) ( Applause )
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we design@@ ed in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less cir@@ cu@@ lation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cl@@ es ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sti@@ c@@ king out from the e@@ dge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can ca@@ t@@ ch the children f@@ all@@ ing off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government off@@ ici@@ al said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es p@@ opp@@ ing through .
And we were allo@@ wed to call this rop@@ e as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , rop@@ e has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they s@@ it on the e@@ dge ."
It looks so n@@ ice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ shing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to sp@@ r@@ ay water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ shing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ ound@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this archit@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ ound@@ ary between cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ stic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qu@@ i@@ et box , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ ound@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ en@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qu@@ i@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion in cla@@ ss ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not supp@@ os@@ ed to be in si@@ l@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In su@@ mm@@ er you go s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never m@@ el@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are supp@@ os@@ ed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they divi@@ de cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are supp@@ os@@ ed to help teach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cla@@ ss@@ room .
And a wa@@ sh@@ b@@ as@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cla@@ ss@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cla@@ ss@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ t@@ a C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite str@@ ong .
He is re@@ si@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of d@@ an@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opport@@ unity we are l@@ os@@ ing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the move@@ ment of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 18@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on a@@ verage ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
J@@ ust like sh@@ e@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prot@@ ect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
"I think archit@@ ec@@ ture is cap@@ able of chan@@ ging this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the at@@ te@@ mp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

"Now , by sho@@ wing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are these beautiful ob@@ jects , but more than that , I think g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous , they are surpri@@ sing , and they &apos;re u@@ se@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most ma@@ ssi@@ ve l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
"And as l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies , to descri@@ be g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers is to descri@@ be the exper@@ im@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four maj@@ or typ@@ es , and the first typ@@ e that I want to descri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster ."
"It is so ma@@ ssi@@ ve that the light pas@@ sing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being di@@ stor@@ ted by the extre@@ me gra@@ vity of this clu@@ ster ."
"And , in fact , if you look very care@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this clu@@ ster ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster has a ma@@ ss of over one million billion s@@ un@@ s ."
"But more than their ma@@ ss , they have this ad@@ di@@ tional fe@@ ature ."
"They are ess@@ enti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large sc@@ al@@ es , such as , how does gra@@ vity work ?"
might be ans@@ wer@@ ed by stud@@ ying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very h@@ ot .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster , and I sub@@ tr@@ act away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , bl@@ ue blo@@ b ."
This is in f@@ al@@ se col@@ or .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ r@@ ay light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The answer is h@@ ot g@@ as , m@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e g@@ as — in fact , it &apos;s pla@@ sm@@ a ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so h@@ ot goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous sli@@ de .
"The extre@@ me gra@@ vity of these systems is acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es of g@@ as to great spe@@ e@@ ds , and great spe@@ e@@ ds means great te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but science is a rou@@ gh dra@@ ft ."
"There are many ba@@ si@@ c pro@@ per@@ ties about this pla@@ sm@@ a that still conf@@ use us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still p@@ us@@ h our underst@@ anding of the phy@@ sic@@ s of the very h@@ ot ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expla@@ in this , I need to tell you a very dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
M@@ ost of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of at@@ om@@ s .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ ost of it is made up of something very , very my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous , which we call d@@ ark matter ."
"D@@ ark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , ex@@ cept through gra@@ vity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a partic@@ le physi@@ ci@@ st , you want to know what happens when we s@@ ma@@ sh things together ."
And d@@ ark matter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"T@@ o answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ ince g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tive sli@@ ces of the universe , sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are m@@ os@@ tly made up of d@@ ark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bl@@ u@@ ish pur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ pres@@ ents the h@@ ot g@@ as , and , of course , you can see many g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a partic@@ le acc@@ el@@ er@@ ator at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small eff@@ ects that might be difficult to de@@ t@@ ect in the la@@ b , might be comp@@ oun@@ ded and comp@@ oun@@ ded into something that we could pos@@ si@@ bly ob@@ ser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ n@@ y ."
"The reason why g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about d@@ ark matter , the reason why g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about the phy@@ sic@@ s of the very small , is pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the phy@@ sic@@ s of the very str@@ an@@ ge .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is cra@@ z@@ y .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything str@@ an@@ ger I think it has to be d@@ ark energy ."
"If I th@@ row a b@@ all into the air , I exp@@ ect it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t exp@@ ect is that it go up at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts understand why the universe is exp@@ anding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s exp@@ anding at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"They give the cause of this acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated exp@@ an@@ sion a name , and they call it d@@ ark energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does d@@ ark energy aff@@ ect the universe at the lar@@ gest sc@@ al@@ es ?"
"D@@ ep@@ ending on how str@@ ong it is , maybe structure for@@ ms fa@@ ster or s@@ lo@@ wer ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly comp@@ li@@ cated ."
Here is a computer si@@ m@@ ulation .
And we need a way to simp@@ li@@ f@@ y it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an anal@@ o@@ gy ."
"If I want to understand the s@@ in@@ king of the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little pos@@ i@@ tions of every single little piece of the bo@@ at that bro@@ ke off ."
The most important thing to do is to tr@@ ack the two big@@ gest parts .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the lar@@ gest sc@@ al@@ es by trac@@ king its big@@ gest piec@@ es and those big@@ gest piec@@ es are clu@@ st@@ ers of g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sli@@ gh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I began by talking about how g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are u@@ se@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ ord when he was asked about cars ."
"He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said fa@@ ster hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day , we as a society are fac@@ ed with many , many difficult problems ."
And the solu@@ tions to these problems are not obvi@@ ous .
They are not fa@@ ster hor@@ ses .
They will requ@@ ire an en@@ or@@ mous amount of scienti@@ fic in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity .
"So , y@@ es , we need to foc@@ us , y@@ es , we need to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate , but we also need to remember that inno@@ v@@ ation , in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity , insp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion — these things come when we bro@@ ad@@ en our field of vi@@ sion when we ste@@ p back when we z@@ oo@@ m out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stud@@ ying the universe around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

"A@@ t the time , I was car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ st at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ing in car@@ di@@ a@@ c ima@@ ging tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es ."
The call came from a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly fe@@ m@@ ale ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e had w@@ o@@ ken up with a fac@@ i@@ al dro@@ op and the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ri@@ ed that she &apos;d had a st@@ ro@@ ke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the z@@ o@@ o and image the an@@ ima@@ l &apos;s heart to look for a possible car@@ di@@ a@@ c cause .
"Now , to be cle@@ ar , Nor@@ th American z@@ oo@@ s are sta@@ ff@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ st@@ anding care of their an@@ ima@@ l patients ."
"But oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally , they do re@@ ach into the human medi@@ cal community , partic@@ ul@@ arly for some speci@@ ality con@@ sul@@ tation , and I was one of the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y physi@@ ci@@ ans who was inv@@ ited in to help ."
"I had a chan@@ ce to ru@@ le out a st@@ ro@@ ke in this ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e and make sure that this g@@ or@@ ill@@ a didn &apos;t have a t@@ or@@ n a@@ ort@@ a , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate this ma@@ ca@@ w for a heart m@@ ur@@ m@@ ur , make sure that this C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a se@@ a li@@ on &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ di@@ um wasn &apos;t inf@@ la@@ med , and in this picture , I &apos;m list@@ ening to the heart of a li@@ on after a li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ving , coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans and physi@@ ci@@ ans where we dra@@ ined 7@@ 00 c@@ c &apos;s of flu@@ id from the sa@@ c in which this li@@ on &apos;s heart was con@@ ta@@ ined ."
"And this pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure , which I have done on many human patients , was identi@@ cal , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that ta@@ il ."
"Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter with physi@@ ci@@ ans , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for their an@@ ima@@ l patients ."
"And oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on r@@ ounds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter and at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very cle@@ ar foc@@ us for me .
"P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were ess@@ enti@@ ally taking care of the same dis@@ or@@ ders in their an@@ ima@@ l and human patients : con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart fa@@ il@@ ure , brain tu@@ m@@ ors , le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a , di@@ a@@ be@@ t@@ es , ar@@ th@@ r@@ it@@ is , A@@ L@@ S , brea@@ st cancer , even p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ om@@ es like de@@ pres@@ sion , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , comp@@ ul@@ sions , e@@ ating dis@@ or@@ ders and self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ."
"Now , I &apos;ve got a conf@@ es@@ sion to make ."
"E@@ ven though I stu@@ died com@@ par@@ ative physi@@ o@@ logy and ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logy as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even wr@@ it@@ ten my sen@@ i@@ or the@@ s@@ is on D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an the@@ ory — learning about the sign@@ i@@ fic@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ or@@ ders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call for me ."
"So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ l@@ aps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an , or con@@ sul@@ t the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for in@@ si@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?"
"Wh@@ y had I never , n@@ or had any of my physi@@ ci@@ an friends and colle@@ ag@@ ues wh@@ om I asked , ever atten@@ ded a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary conf@@ er@@ ence ?"
"For that matter , why was any of this a surpri@@ se ?"
"I mean , look , every single physi@@ ci@@ an ac@@ cep@@ ts some bio@@ logical connec@@ tion between animals and humans ."
E@@ very medi@@ cation that we pre@@ scri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our fami@@ lies has first been te@@ sted on an an@@ ima@@ l .
But there &apos;s something very different about giving an an@@ ima@@ l a medi@@ cation or a human disease and the an@@ ima@@ l develop@@ ing con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart fa@@ il@@ ure or di@@ a@@ be@@ t@@ es or brea@@ st cancer on their own .
"Now , maybe some of the surpri@@ se comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing se@@ par@@ ation in our world between the ur@@ b@@ an and the non@@ ur@@ b@@ an ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that w@@ ool gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a pl@@ ant ."
"Well , today &apos;s human h@@ osp@@ it@@ als , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als of technology ."
And this cre@@ ates a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical dist@@ ance between the human patients who are being tre@@ ated there and an@@ ima@@ l patients who are living in oce@@ ans and far@@ ms and j@@ un@@ g@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ ep@@ er reason .
"P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and scientists , we ac@@ cept int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually that our species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , is mer@@ ely one species , no more uni@@ que or speci@@ al than any other ."
"But in our hear@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m list@@ ening to M@@ o@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the Mar@@ s R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ oo@@ k .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ al@@ ism , even as I recogn@@ ize the scienti@@ fic@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ i@@ or species , ap@@ art ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"When I see a human pati@@ ent now , I always ask , what do the an@@ ima@@ l doc@@ tors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?"
"And , might I be taking better care of my human pati@@ ent if I saw them as a human an@@ ima@@ l pati@@ ent ?"
Here are a few exa@@ mp@@ les of the kind of exc@@ iting connec@@ tions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ ure .
"A@@ r@@ ound the year 2@@ 000 , human car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts &quot; &quot; disco@@ vered &quot; &quot; emoti@@ on@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"It was descri@@ bed in a g@@ am@@ bl@@ ing father who had lost his life &apos;s sa@@ v@@ ings with a ro@@ ll of the di@@ ce , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter ."
"But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is was ne@@ i@@ ther new , n@@ or was it uni@@ qu@@ ely human ."
"@@ V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting emoti@@ on@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s in animals ran@@ ging from mon@@ ke@@ ys to f@@ la@@ min@@ go@@ s , from to de@@ er to r@@ ab@@ b@@ its , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
How many human lives might have been sa@@ ved if this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary knowle@@ dge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ury .
S@@ ome human patients har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome pl@@ uc@@ k out pat@@ ch@@ es of ha@@ ir , others actually c@@ ut themselves ."
S@@ ome an@@ ima@@ l patients also har@@ m themselves .
There are bir@@ ds that pl@@ uc@@ k out f@@ ea@@ thers .
There are st@@ al@@ li@@ ons that re@@ pe@@ ti@@ ti@@ vely b@@ ite their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very speci@@ fic and very eff@@ ective ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury in their self-@@ in@@ j@@ uring animals .
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary knowle@@ dge be put into the hands of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ i@@ sts and parents and patients str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ?
P@@ os@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is .
"S@@ ome@@ times , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , some women become de@@ pre@@ ssed , and sometimes they become ser@@ i@@ ously de@@ pre@@ ssed and even p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ic ."
"They may ne@@ gl@@ ect their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some extre@@ me ca@@ ses , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally , a m@@ are , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , will ne@@ gl@@ ect the fo@@ al , re@@ f@@ using to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some inst@@ anc@@ es , k@@ ic@@ k the fo@@ al , even to de@@ ath ."
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vi@@ sed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to de@@ al with this fo@@ al re@@ j@@ ection sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome that inv@@ ol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the m@@ are .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the b@@ on@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this lea@@ ds to r@@ ene@@ wed inter@@ est , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al ."
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and patients who are str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is ?
"Well , de@@ sp@@ ite all of this pr@@ om@@ ise , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately the g@@ ul@@ f between our fiel@@ ds re@@ ma@@ ins large ."
"T@@ o expla@@ in it , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to have to air some di@@ r@@ ty la@@ und@@ ry ."
S@@ ome physi@@ ci@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about doc@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"I &apos;m talking about d@@ enti@@ sts and op@@ t@@ ome@@ tri@@ sts and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , but maybe esp@@ eci@@ ally an@@ ima@@ l doc@@ tors ."
"O@@ f course , most physi@@ ci@@ ans don &apos;t real@@ ize that it is har@@ der to get into v@@ et school these days than medi@@ cal school , and that when we go to medi@@ cal school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , but ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in ma@@ mm@@ als , a@@ mp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ p@@ ti@@ les , fish and bir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t b@@ la@@ me the ve@@ ts for feel@@ ing an@@ no@@ yed by my prof@@ es@@ sion &apos;s con@@ de@@ sc@@ en@@ sion and i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
"A physi@@ ci@@ an . ( Laughter ) C@@ l@@ os@@ ing the ga@@ p has become a pas@@ sion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through progra@@ ms like D@@ ar@@ w@@ in on R@@ ounds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , where we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing an@@ ima@@ l exper@@ ts and ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logi@@ sts and em@@ be@@ d@@ ding them on our medi@@ cal tea@@ ms with our inter@@ ns and our re@@ si@@ d@@ ents ."

"In the United States and now inter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ ally , at Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity conf@@ er@@ ences physi@@ ci@@ ans and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans ch@@ ec@@ k their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des and their pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions at the do@@ or and come together as colle@@ ag@@ ues , as pe@@ ers , as doc@@ tors ."

"So I was tra@@ ined to become a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ st for two years in H@@ un@@ an , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"When I was in the first gra@@ de , the government wanted to trans@@ f@@ er me to a school for a@@ th@@ le@@ t@@ es , all exp@@ en@@ ses pa@@ id ."
"But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engine@@ er like them ."
"A@@ f@@ ter survi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ ev@@ olution , they fir@@ m@@ ly beli@@ ev@@ ed there &apos;s only one sure way to happ@@ iness : a sa@@ fe and w@@ ell@@ -@@ pa@@ id job ."
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dre@@ am was to become a Chin@@ ese oper@@ a sing@@ er .
That is me pla@@ ying my ima@@ gin@@ ary pi@@ an@@ o .
"A@@ n oper@@ a sing@@ er must start tra@@ ining young to learn ac@@ ro@@ b@@ ati@@ c@@ s , so I tried everything I could to go to oper@@ a school ."
I even wr@@ ote to the school prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al and the h@@ ost of a radi@@ o show .
But no ad@@ ul@@ ts li@@ ked the idea .
No ad@@ ul@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was ser@@ i@@ ous .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends supp@@ or@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ ra@@ id that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss happ@@ iness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fa@@ ir .
So I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to find another call@@ ing .
N@@ o@@ body around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to boo@@ ks .
I sa@@ tis@@ fied my h@@ un@@ ger for par@@ ental adv@@ ice from this book by a family of wr@@ it@@ ers and m@@ usi@@ ci@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ dence in the F@@ a@@ mi@@ ly of F@@ ou L@@ e@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tra@@ di@@ tion requ@@ i@@ res o@@ be@@ di@@ ence . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ an@@ e E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be eff@@ ici@@ ent from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ aper by the D@@ o@@ z@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was insp@@ i@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ om@@ p@@ le@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( a@@ k@@ a E@@ ch@@ o C@@ ha@@ n ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons F@@ rom H@@ i@@ story &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.@@ S@@ . in 199@@ 5 , so which boo@@ ks did I read here first ?"
"B@@ oo@@ ks ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The G@@ ood Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chin@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent for pro@@ p@@ ag@@ and@@ a . G@@ ot it .
"The B@@ i@@ ble is interesting , but str@@ an@@ ge ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a t@@ op@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th comm@@ and@@ ment gave me an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sh@@ all hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
"@@ &quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it be@@ comes my too@@ l to clim@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing .
It off@@ ers many in@@ si@@ ghts .
"For example , I found this ma@@ p out of place at first because this is what Chin@@ ese students gre@@ w up with ."
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cen@@ ter of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ ri@@ es somebody &apos;s view .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a st@@ and@@ ard pr@@ acti@@ ce in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic world .
There are even research fiel@@ ds such as com@@ par@@ ative reli@@ gi@@ on and com@@ par@@ ative liter@@ ature .
C@@ om@@ p@@ are and con@@ tra@@ st gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s a more comple@@ te underst@@ anding of a t@@ op@@ ic .
"So I thought , well , if com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in da@@ i@@ ly life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing boo@@ ks in pa@@ ir@@ s .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in F@@ ran@@ k@@ l@@ in &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n A@@ da@@ ms &quot; &quot; by D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are inv@@ olved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with shar@@ ed experi@@ ences ."

"For the B@@ u@@ dd@@ h@@ a , they are all p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical : l@@ ust , f@@ ear and social du@@ ty — interesting ."
"So if you know a fore@@ i@@ gn language , it &apos;s also fu@@ n to read your fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite boo@@ ks in two langu@@ ages ."

&quot; &quot; B@@ ri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Chin@@ ese liter@@ ally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .

I know I sh@@ all never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ a@@ ving a dre@@ am sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed really is nothing com@@ par@@ ed to what many others have su@@ ff@@ ered .

This back here was my brain cancer .
Is@@ n &apos;t it n@@ ice ?
"( Laughter ) The key ph@@ ra@@ se is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; ph@@ ew ."
"( Applause ) H@@ a@@ ving brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , sho@@ c@@ king news for me ."
I knew nothing about cancer .
"In W@@ est@@ er@@ n cul@@ tures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you dis@@ appe@@ ar in a way ."
"@@ Y@@ our life as a comple@@ x human being is re@@ plac@@ ed by medi@@ cal data : Y@@ our images , your exa@@ ms , your la@@ b val@@ ues , a li@@ st of medi@@ c@@ ines ."
And everyone chan@@ ges as well .
You su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start spea@@ king a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start po@@ in@@ ting their fin@@ g@@ ers at your body and your images .
"@@ People start chan@@ ging as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doc@@ tor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ell@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in the me@@ an@@ while , you &apos;re left with questions to which no@@ body gi@@ ves an answer ."
These are the &quot; &quot; C@@ an I ? &quot; &quot; questions : C@@ an I work while I have cancer ?
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be cre@@ ative ?
"And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to de@@ ser@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?"
"A@@ re there any other op@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; And , obvi@@ ously , doc@@ tors are the good guys in all these sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os , because they are very prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal and de@@ di@@ cated to cur@@ ing you ."
"But they also are very used to having to de@@ al with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes l@@ ose the idea that this is t@@ or@@ ture for you and that you become , liter@@ ally , a pati@@ ent — &quot; pati@@ ent &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ings are chan@@ ging , but cla@@ s@@ sically , they t@@ end to not eng@@ age you in any way to learn about your condi@@ tion , to get your friends and family eng@@ ag@@ ed , or sho@@ wing you ways in which you can change your li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le to min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the ris@@ ks of what you &apos;re going through ."
"But instead , you &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed there to wa@@ it in the hands of a ser@@ ies of very prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal str@@ ang@@ ers ."
"W@@ hi@@ le I was in the h@@ osp@@ ital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-@@ out picture of my cancer and I sp@@ o@@ ke with it ."
"It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common pr@@ acti@@ ce to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A c@@ ure , wh@@ ic@@ he@@ ver it is , will have to de@@ al with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the h@@ osp@@ ital against medi@@ cal adv@@ ice ."
I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to change my relation@@ ship with the cancer and I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dra@@ stic as a sur@@ g@@ ery .
"I &apos;m an arti@@ st , I use se@@ ver@@ al for@@ ms of op@@ en@@ -@@ source techno@@ logi@@ es and open information in my pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
"So my best be@@ t was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be acc@@ ess@@ ed by any@@ one ."
"So I created a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , which is called L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a , on which I put my medi@@ cal data , on@@ line ."
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ ec@@ h .
"( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose this word , L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a — L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a in I@@ tal@@ i@@ an means &quot; &quot; the c@@ ure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; c@@ ure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our W@@ est@@ er@@ n cul@@ tures , it means er@@ a@@ di@@ ca@@ ting or re@@ ver@@ sing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ si@@ a , from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from L@@ ati@@ n countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"O@@ f course , I was interest@@ ed in the op@@ ini@@ ons of doc@@ tors and heal@@ th@@ care provi@@ ders , but I was also interest@@ ed in the c@@ ure of the arti@@ st , of the po@@ et , of the design@@ er , of , who kno@@ ws , the m@@ usi@@ ci@@ ans ."
"I was interest@@ ed in the social c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the emoti@@ onal c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in any form of c@@ ure ."
"And , it worked ."
The L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite went vir@@ al .
"I re@@ cei@@ ved lots of media atten@@ tion from I@@ tal@@ y and from ab@@ ro@@ ad and I quickly re@@ cei@@ ved more than 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts — e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , social net@@ working — most of them were a su@@ g@@ ge@@ s@@ tion on how to c@@ ure my cancer , but more of them were about how to c@@ ure myself as a full individu@@ al ."
"For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , images , pic@@ tures , art per@@ form@@ anc@@ es were produc@@ ed for L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
"For example , here we see F@@ r@@ anc@@ es@@ ca F@@ in@@ i in her per@@ form@@ ance ."
"O@@ r , as arti@@ st P@@ at@@ ri@@ ck L@@ ic@@ h@@ ty has done : He produc@@ ed a 3@@ D sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ m@@ or and put it on s@@ ale on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ ver@@ se ."
"Now you can have my cancer , too !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich is a n@@ ice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer ."
"And this was going on — scientists , the tra@@ di@@ tional medi@@ c@@ ine exper@@ ts , se@@ ver@@ al re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers , doc@@ tors — all connec@@ ted with me to give adv@@ ice ."
"W@@ ith all this information and supp@@ ort , I was able to form a team of se@@ ver@@ al neur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ ons , tra@@ di@@ tional doc@@ tors , on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ red v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with wh@@ om I was able to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s the information I was re@@ cei@@ ving , which is very important ."
"And together , we were able to form a str@@ ate@@ gy for my own c@@ ure in many langu@@ ages , ac@@ cor@@ ding to many cul@@ tures ."
"And the curr@@ ent str@@ ate@@ gy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite re@@ mark@@ able for me ."
"@@ &#91; S@@ ur@@ g@@ ery &#93; The follo@@ w@@ -@@ up M@@ R@@ I@@ s sho@@ wed , l@@ uc@@ ki@@ ly , little to no gro@@ w@@ th of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
"I ch@@ ose the doc@@ tor I wanted to work with , I ch@@ ose the h@@ osp@@ ital I wanted to st@@ ay in , and in the me@@ an@@ while , I was supp@@ or@@ ted by thousands of people , n@@ one of wh@@ om felt p@@ ity for me ."
"E@@ very@@ one felt like they could take an ac@@ tive ro@@ le in help@@ ing me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m f@@ ine , as you can see , pretty f@@ ine ."
"( Applause ) I had exc@@ ell@@ ent news after the sur@@ g@@ ery — I have — I had a very lo@@ w@@ -@@ gra@@ de g@@ li@@ om@@ a , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot ."
I have completely changed my life and my li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
E@@ very@@ thing I did was thou@@ gh@@ t@@ fully design@@ ed to get me eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"@@ U@@ p until the very last few minutes of the sur@@ g@@ ery , which was very in@@ ten@@ se , a mat@@ ri@@ x of elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des was imp@@ lan@@ ted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of what the brain contro@@ ls ."
"And right before the oper@@ ation , we were able to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s the fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of my brain with the doc@@ tor , to understand which ris@@ ks I was run@@ ning into and if there were any I wanted to a@@ vo@@ id ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were ."
&#91; O@@ p@@ en &#93; And this op@@ en@@ ness was really the fundam@@ ental part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a .
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people shar@@ ed their stories , their experi@@ ences ."
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t u@@ su@@ ally con@@ sul@@ t when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , contin@@ u@@ ous state of trans@@ lation am@@ ong many different langu@@ ages , in which science me@@ ets emoti@@ on and conv@@ enti@@ onal research me@@ ets tra@@ di@@ tional research ."
&#91; S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really eng@@ ag@@ ed and connec@@ ted society wh@@ ose w@@ ell@@ ness really dep@@ ends on the w@@ ell@@ ness of all of its comp@@ on@@ ents .
This global per@@ form@@ ance is my op@@ en@@ -@@ source c@@ ure for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a c@@ ure for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .

"A big challenge is , how should the i@@ P@@ a@@ ds be used , and what app@@ s should we put on the i@@ P@@ a@@ ds ?"
"M@@ y job is that I li@@ e to children , but they &apos;re hon@@ est lies ."
"I wr@@ ite children &apos;s boo@@ ks , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e from P@@ ab@@ l@@ o P@@ i@@ ca@@ s@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not tru@@ th ."
Ar@@ t is a li@@ e that makes us real@@ ize tru@@ th or at least the tru@@ th that is given us to understand .

"That li@@ min@@ al space , that &apos;s art ."
All right . V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very help@@ ful either .
"The thing that made me understand that quot@@ e and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids ."
I used to be a su@@ mm@@ er ca@@ m@@ p coun@@ sel@@ or .
"I would do it on my su@@ mm@@ ers off from colle@@ ge , and I lo@@ ved it ."
It was a sp@@ or@@ ts su@@ mm@@ er ca@@ m@@ p for f@@ our@@ - to si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"I was in char@@ ge of the f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play sp@@ or@@ ts , and ne@@ i@@ ther can I@@ ."
"( Laughter ) I play sp@@ or@@ ts at a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old level , so what would happen is the kids would dri@@ b@@ ble around some con@@ es , and then got h@@ ot , and then they would go s@@ it under@@ ne@@ ath the t@@ ree where I was already sit@@ ting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life ."
"I would tell them about how , on the wee@@ k@@ ends , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of Eng@@ land ."
"And so@@ on , other kids who wer@@ en &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Ma@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t , right ?"
You &apos;re the guy who sp@@ ies for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of Eng@@ land . &quot; &quot; And I had been wa@@ iting my whole life for str@@ ang@@ ers to come up and ask me that question .
"In my f@@ an@@ t@@ asy , they were s@@ vel@@ te R@@ us@@ si@@ an women , but , you know , f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was fami@@ li@@ ar to me and really exc@@ iting .
"I think the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of this for me — I &apos;ll never for@@ get this — there was this little gir@@ l nam@@ ed R@@ i@@ le@@ y . She was tin@@ y , and she used to always take out her l@@ unch every day and she would th@@ row out her f@@ ru@@ it ."
"S@@ he would just take her f@@ ru@@ it , her mo@@ m p@@ ac@@ ked her a m@@ el@@ on every day , and she would just th@@ row it in the i@@ v@@ y and then she would e@@ at f@@ ru@@ it s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks and pu@@ d@@ ding cu@@ ps , and I was like , &quot; &quot; R@@ i@@ le@@ y , you can &apos;t do that , you have to e@@ at the f@@ ru@@ it . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you th@@ row the f@@ ru@@ it in the i@@ v@@ y , pretty so@@ on , it &apos;s going to be over@@ gro@@ wn with m@@ el@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I en@@ ded up telling stories to children and not being a n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion@@ ist for children ."
"And so R@@ i@@ le@@ y was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of ca@@ m@@ p , I got up early and I got a big can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e from the gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore and I hi@@ d it in the i@@ v@@ y , and then at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , I was like , &quot; R@@ i@@ le@@ y , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;"
"And — ( Laughter ) — she went tru@@ d@@ ging through the i@@ v@@ y , and then her eyes just got so wi@@ de , and she po@@ in@@ ted out this m@@ el@@ on that was big@@ ger than her head , and then all the kids r@@ an over there and ru@@ shed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why is there a sti@@ c@@ ker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not th@@ row your sti@@ c@@ kers in the i@@ v@@ y ."
"P@@ ut them in the tra@@ sh can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And R@@ i@@ le@@ y car@@ ri@@ ed that m@@ el@@ on around with her all day , and she was so p@@ rou@@ d ."
"And R@@ i@@ le@@ y knew she didn &apos;t grow a m@@ el@@ on in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a we@@ ird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"S@@ he was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
"It &apos;s what C@@ ol@@ eri@@ dge called the w@@ ill@@ ing su@@ sp@@ en@@ sion of dis@@ belie@@ f or po@@ e@@ tic fa@@ ith , for those mom@@ ents where a story , no matter how str@@ an@@ ge , has some se@@ m@@ bl@@ ance of the tru@@ th , and then you &apos;re able to believe it ."
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"A@@ d@@ ul@@ ts can too , and we get there when we read ."
"It &apos;s why in two days , people will be de@@ sc@@ ending on D@@ u@@ bl@@ in to take the wal@@ king t@@ our of B@@ lo@@ om@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ l@@ y@@ ss@@ es , &quot; &quot; even though n@@ one of that happened ."
"O@@ r people go to L@@ on@@ don and they vi@@ s@@ it B@@ a@@ ker S@@ tre@@ et to see S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck H@@ ol@@ m@@ es &apos; ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , even though 2@@ 2@@ 1@@ B is just a number that was pa@@ in@@ ted on a building that never actually had that ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"We know these char@@ ac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real , but we have real feel@@ ings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these char@@ ac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real ,@@ "
and yet we also know that they are .
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more ea@@ si@@ ly than ad@@ ul@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love wr@@ iting for kids ."
I think kids are the best au@@ di@@ ence for ser@@ i@@ ous liter@@ ary fic@@ tion .
"When I was a k@@ id , I was ob@@ se@@ ssed with sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or no@@ vel@@ s , things like &quot; &quot; N@@ ar@@ ni@@ a , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ dro@@ be and go through to a ma@@ gi@@ cal land ."
And I was conv@@ inc@@ ed that sec@@ re@@ t do@@ ors really did ex@@ ist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
"I wanted to live and c@@ ross over into that fic@@ tional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s clos@@ et do@@ ors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mo@@ m &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s clos@@ et , and there was not a sec@@ re@@ t ma@@ gi@@ cal land there ."
There was some other we@@ ird stuff that I think my mo@@ m should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
"A@@ f@@ ter colle@@ ge , my first job was working behind one of these sec@@ re@@ t do@@ ors ."
This is a place called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a .
"It &apos;s at 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et in the M@@ is@@ sion in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , and when I worked there , there was a publi@@ shing company hea@@ d@@ qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ed there called M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s , a non@@ prof@@ it wr@@ iting cen@@ ter called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , but then the front of it was a str@@ an@@ ge sho@@ p ."
"You see , this place was z@@ on@@ ed re@@ ta@@ il , and in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the wr@@ it@@ er who f@@ oun@@ ded it , a wr@@ it@@ er nam@@ ed D@@ a@@ ve E@@ g@@ g@@ ers , to come into comp@@ li@@ ance with co@@ de , he said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , I &apos;m just going to build a p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all w@@ ood ."
There &apos;s dra@@ w@@ ers you can pul@@ l out and get c@@ it@@ r@@ us so you don &apos;t get sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
"They have ey@@ ep@@ at@@ ch@@ es in lots of col@@ ors , because when it &apos;s sp@@ r@@ ing@@ time , p@@ ir@@ ates want to go wi@@ ld ."
You don &apos;t know . B@@ l@@ ack is bor@@ ing . P@@ a@@ ste@@ l .
"O@@ r eyes , also in lots of col@@ ors , just g@@ la@@ ss eyes , dep@@ ending on how you want to de@@ al with that situ@@ ation ."
"And the st@@ ore , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly , people came to them and b@@ ou@@ ght things , and they en@@ ded up pa@@ ying the r@@ ent for our tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the qu@@ ality of work you do , kids would come and get in@@ struc@@ tion in wr@@ iting , and when you have to walk this we@@ ird , li@@ min@@ al , fic@@ tional space like this to go do your wr@@ iting , it &apos;s going to aff@@ ect the kind of work that you make ."
It &apos;s a sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or that you can walk through .
"So I r@@ an the 8@@ 2@@ 6 in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , and it was my job to build the st@@ ore down there ."
So we have The E@@ ch@@ o P@@ ark T@@ i@@ me T@@ ra@@ vel M@@ art .
"That &apos;s our m@@ ot@@ to : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on S@@ un@@ set B@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es ."
O@@ ur fri@@ end@@ ly st@@ af@@ f is ready to help you .
"They &apos;re from all er@@ as , inclu@@ ding just the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very rec@@ ent past ."
"There &apos;s our E@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es of the M@@ on@@ th , inclu@@ ding G@@ en@@ gh@@ is K@@ ha@@ n , Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ic@@ k@@ ens ."
S@@ ome great people have come up through our ran@@ ks .
This is our kind of ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy sec@@ tion .
"We have some pat@@ ent medi@@ c@@ ines , C@@ an@@ op@@ ic j@@ ar@@ s for your org@@ ans , communi@@ st so@@ a@@ p that says , &quot; &quot; This is your so@@ a@@ p for the year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) O@@ ur s@@ l@@ u@@ sh@@ y machine bro@@ ke on the op@@ ening night and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
O@@ ur archit@@ ect was co@@ vered in red sy@@ r@@ up .
"It looked like he had just m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular archit@@ ect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
It was going to be the high@@ light of our st@@ ore .
"So we just put that si@@ gn on it that said , &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of order . C@@ ome back y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that en@@ ded up being a better jo@@ ke than s@@ l@@ u@@ sh@@ ies , so we just left it there fore@@ ver ."
"M@@ am@@ m@@ ot@@ h Ch@@ un@@ ks . These things we@@ i@@ gh , like , seven p@@ ounds each ."
B@@ ar@@ b@@ ari@@ an re@@ p@@ ell@@ ent . It &apos;s full of s@@ al@@ ad and pot@@ p@@ our@@ r@@ i — things that bar@@ b@@ ari@@ ans h@@ ate .
D@@ ead langu@@ ages .
"( Laughter ) L@@ e@@ ech@@ es , nature &apos;s tin@@ y doc@@ tors ."
"And V@@ i@@ king O@@ d@@ or@@ ant , which comes in lots of great sc@@ ents : to@@ en@@ a@@ il@@ s , s@@ we@@ at and r@@ ot@@ ten ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les , p@@ y@@ re as@@ h ."
"Because we believe that A@@ x@@ e B@@ o@@ dy S@@ pr@@ ay is something that you should only find on the b@@ att@@ le@@ field , not under your ar@@ ms . ( Laughter ) And these are ro@@ bo@@ t emoti@@ on ch@@ i@@ ps , so ro@@ bot@@ s can feel love or f@@ ear ."
"O@@ ur big@@ gest sel@@ l@@ er is S@@ cha@@ den@@ f@@ re@@ u@@ de , which we did not exp@@ ect ."
( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
"But there &apos;s a non@@ prof@@ it behind it , and kids go through a do@@ or that says &quot; &quot; E@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es O@@ n@@ ly &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do h@@ ome@@ work and wr@@ ite stories and make fil@@ ms and this is a book re@@ lease par@@ ty where kids will read ."
"There &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly that &apos;s publi@@ shed with just wr@@ iting that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have re@@ lease par@@ ties and they e@@ at ca@@ ke and read for their parents and dr@@ ink mil@@ k out of cha@@ mp@@ ag@@ ne g@@ la@@ ss@@ es ."
"And it &apos;s a very speci@@ al space , because it &apos;s this we@@ ird space in the front ."
The jo@@ ke isn &apos;t a jo@@ ke .
"You can &apos;t find the se@@ a@@ ms on the fic@@ tion , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fic@@ tion that &apos;s col@@ on@@ ized the real world ."
I see it as kind of a book in three di@@ men@@ sions .
"There &apos;s a ter@@ m called me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tion , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and me@@ t@@ a &apos;s having a moment now ."
"I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s with no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts like Jo@@ h@@ n B@@ ar@@ th and W@@ illi@@ am G@@ ad@@ d@@ is , but it &apos;s been around ."
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ telling itself .
And one me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tive tech@@ ni@@ que is brea@@ king the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s when an ac@@ tor will turn to the au@@ di@@ ence and say , &quot; &quot; I am an ac@@ tor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that supp@@ os@@ ed@@ ly hon@@ est moment , I would ar@@ gu@@ e , is in serv@@ ice of the li@@ e , but it &apos;s supp@@ os@@ ed to fore@@ ground the arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ality of the fic@@ tion ."
"For me , I kind of pre@@ f@@ er the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"If I &apos;m going to brea@@ k down the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all , I want fic@@ tion to es@@ cap@@ e and come into the real world ."
I want a book to be a sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or that op@@ ens and le@@ ts the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my boo@@ ks .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ ly T@@ wit@@ ters and his B@@ l@@ ue Wh@@ ale P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a k@@ id who gets a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale as a pe@@ t but it &apos;s a p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment and it ru@@ ins his life .
So it &apos;s deli@@ vered over@@ night by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o — very t@@ ough city to own a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale in .
"A lot of h@@ ill@@ s , real est@@ ate is at a pre@@ mi@@ um ."
"This market &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y , everybody ."
"But under@@ ne@@ ath the j@@ ack@@ et is this case , and that &apos;s the co@@ ver under@@ ne@@ ath the book , the j@@ ack@@ et , and there &apos;s an ad that off@@ ers a free 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day ri@@ sk@@ -@@ free tri@@ al for a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale ."
And you can just s@@ end in a self-@@ ad@@ dre@@ ssed sta@@ mp@@ ed en@@ vel@@ op@@ e and we &apos;ll s@@ end you a wh@@ ale .
And kids do wr@@ ite in .
"So here &apos;s a le@@ tter . It says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ear people , I be@@ t you 10 b@@ uc@@ ks you won &apos;t s@@ end me a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale ."
"E@@ li@@ ot G@@ an@@ n@@ on ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what E@@ li@@ ot and the other kids who s@@ end these in get back is a le@@ tter in very small pr@@ int from a Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an la@@ w fir@@ m — ( Laughter ) — that says that du@@ e to a change in cu@@ st@@ om@@ s la@@ ws , their wh@@ ale has been hel@@ d up in S@@ o@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ ord , which is a very lo@@ vely f@@ j@@ ord , and then it just kind of tal@@ ks about S@@ o@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ ord and Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an food for a little while . It di@@ gre@@ ss@@ es . ( Laughter )@@ "
But it fin@@ i@@ sh@@ es off by saying that your wh@@ ale would love to hear from you .
"He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a messa@@ ge ."
"And when you call and leave him a messa@@ ge , you just , on the out@@ going messa@@ ge , it &apos;s just wh@@ ale s@@ ounds and then a be@@ ep , which actually s@@ ounds a lot like a wh@@ ale sound ."
And they get a picture of their wh@@ ale too .
"So this is R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h , and R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to a k@@ id nam@@ ed N@@ ic@@ o who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s messa@@ ge ."
This is the first messa@@ ge I ever got from N@@ ic@@ o .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I am your o@@ w@@ ner , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h . H@@ ell@@ o ."
"So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you so@@ on another day . B@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ a@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t : So N@@ ic@@ o called back , like , an h@@ our later ."
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s messa@@ ges .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you for a long time , but I tal@@ ked to you on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , y@@ eah , S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , so now I &apos;m call@@ ing you again to say h@@ ell@@ o and I won@@ der what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tom@@ or@@ row or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again ."
He &apos;s left over 25 messa@@ ges for R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h over four years .
"You find out all about him and the gr@@ and@@ m@@ a that he lo@@ ves and the gr@@ and@@ m@@ a that he li@@ kes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the c@@ ros@@ s@@ word pu@@ z@@ z@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more messa@@ ge from N@@ ic@@ o ."
This is the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as messa@@ ge from N@@ ic@@ o .
"@@ &#91; Be@@ ep &#93; ( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h , sor@@ ry I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you in a long time ."
"It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so bus@@ y because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a wh@@ ale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m call@@ ing you to just say , to w@@ ish you a mer@@ ry Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as ."
"So have a n@@ ice Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , and b@@ y@@ e-@@ b@@ y@@ e , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h . Goo@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ B : I actually got N@@ ic@@ o , I ha@@ dn &apos;t heard from in 1@@ 8 months , and he just left a messa@@ ge two days ago ."
"H@@ is vo@@ ice is completely different , but he put his bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ter on the phone , and she was very n@@ ice to R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h as well ."
But N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s the best read@@ er I could hope for .
I would want any@@ one I was wr@@ iting for to be in that place emoti@@ on@@ ally with the things that I create .
"I feel l@@ uc@@ k@@ y . K@@ i@@ ds like N@@ ic@@ o are the best read@@ ers , and they de@@ ser@@ ve the best stories we can give them ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It has been 1@@ 2@@ 8 years since the last country in the world ab@@ o@@ li@@ shed s@@ la@@ very and 5@@ 3 years since Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing pr@@ on@@ oun@@ c@@ ed his &quot; &quot; I H@@ a@@ ve A D@@ re@@ am &quot; &quot; spe@@ ec@@ h .
"But we still live in a world where the col@@ or of our sk@@ in not only gi@@ ves a first imp@@ re@@ s@@ sion , but a la@@ sting one that re@@ ma@@ ins ."
I was born in a family full of col@@ ors .
My father is the son of a ma@@ id from wh@@ om he in@@ her@@ ited an in@@ ten@@ se d@@ ark cho@@ col@@ ate t@@ one .
He was ad@@ op@@ ted by those who I know as my gr@@ and@@ parents .
"The mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch , my gr@@ and@@ m@@ a , has a por@@ c@@ el@@ a@@ in sk@@ in and c@@ ot@@ t@@ on@@ -@@ like ha@@ ir ."
"M@@ y gr@@ and@@ p@@ a was some@@ where between a v@@ an@@ ill@@ a and stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry y@@ o@@ g@@ ur@@ t t@@ one , like my un@@ cle and my cou@@ s@@ in ."
"M@@ y mother is a c@@ in@@ nam@@ on@@ -@@ sk@@ in d@@ aughter of a n@@ ative B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ an , with a p@@ in@@ ch of ha@@ z@@ el and hon@@ ey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mi@@ x of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e with mil@@ k , but with a lot of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ."
She has two sist@@ ers .
"One in a to@@ a@@ ste@@ d-@@ pe@@ an@@ ut sk@@ in and the other , also ad@@ op@@ ted , more on the be@@ i@@ ge side , like a p@@ an@@ ca@@ ke ."
"( Laughter ) G@@ ro@@ wing up in this family , col@@ or was never important for me ."
"O@@ ut@@ side home , ho@@ we@@ ver , things were different so@@ on ."
C@@ ol@@ or had many other me@@ an@@ ings .
I remember my first dra@@ wing le@@ ss@@ ons in school as a b@@ unch of con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory feel@@ ings .
It was exc@@ iting and cre@@ ative but I never underst@@ ood the uni@@ que f@@ le@@ sh@@ -@@ co@@ lo@@ red p@@ en@@ ci@@ l .
I was made of f@@ le@@ sh but I wasn &apos;t p@@ ink .
"M@@ y sk@@ in was bro@@ wn , and people said I was black ."
I was seven years old with a m@@ ess of col@@ ors in my head .
"L@@ ater , when I took my cou@@ s@@ in to school , I was u@@ su@@ ally taken for the n@@ an@@ n@@ y ."
"B@@ y help@@ ing in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en at a friend &apos;s par@@ ty , people thought I was the ma@@ id ."
I was even tre@@ ated like a pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ te just because I was wal@@ king alone on the be@@ ach with Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an friends .
"And many times , vi@@ sit@@ ing my gr@@ and@@ m@@ a or friends in u@@ pp@@ er cla@@ ss buil@@ d@@ ings , I was inv@@ ited not to use the ma@@ in el@@ ev@@ ator ."
"Because in the end , with this col@@ or and this ha@@ ir , I cannot b@@ el@@ ong to some places ."
"In some way , I get to used to it and ac@@ cept part of it ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , something inside of me ke@@ e@@ ps re@@ v@@ ol@@ ving and str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling ."
Y@@ ear@@ s later I mar@@ ri@@ ed a S@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ard .
But not any S@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ard .
I ch@@ ose one with the sk@@ in col@@ or of a lob@@ ster when s@@ un@@ bur@@ n@@ t .
"( Laughter ) S@@ ince then , a new question started to cha@@ se me ."
What will be the col@@ or of your children ?
"As you can understand , this is my last con@@ cer@@ n ."
"But thinking about it , with my pre@@ vi@@ ous b@@ ack@@ ground , my story led me to make my pers@@ onal ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se as a photograp@@ her ."
And that is how H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was born .
"H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e is a pur@@ su@@ it to high@@ light our true col@@ ors , rather than the un@@ true wh@@ ite , red , black or y@@ el@@ low as@@ soci@@ ated with r@@ ace ."
It &apos;s a kind of ga@@ me to question our co@@ des .
It &apos;s a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss from a pers@@ onal story to a global history .
I por@@ tr@@ ay the sub@@ jects in a wh@@ ite b@@ ack@@ ground .
"Th@@ en I cho@@ ose an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ pi@@ x@@ el squ@@ are from the n@@ ose , pa@@ int the b@@ ack@@ ground , and look for the cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or in the indu@@ stri@@ al p@@ al@@ et@@ te , P@@ an@@ t@@ one ."
"I started with my family and friends , then more and more people jo@@ ined the adv@@ ent@@ ure , th@@ an@@ ks to public call@@ s coming through the social media ."
I thought that the ma@@ in space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open con@@ cept that inv@@ it@@ es everybody to p@@ us@@ h the share bu@@ t@@ ton in both the computer and their brain .
The s@@ no@@ w@@ b@@ all started to ro@@ ll .
"The project had a great w@@ el@@ come — inv@@ it@@ ations , ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , physi@@ cal for@@ mat@@ s , g@@ all@@ er@@ ies and mu@@ se@@ um@@ s ..@@ ."
just happened .
"And am@@ ong them , my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite : when H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ies public sp@@ ac@@ es and appe@@ ar@@ s in the stre@@ et , it f@@ os@@ ters a pop@@ ular de@@ b@@ ate and cre@@ ates a feel@@ ing of community ."
"I have por@@ tra@@ yed more than 3@@ ,000 people in 1@@ 3 different countries , 1@@ 9 different cities around the world ."
"@@ J@@ ust to men@@ tion some of them — from someone inclu@@ ded in the F@@ or@@ b@@ es li@@ st , to re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who c@@ ros@@ sed the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an by bo@@ at ."
"In P@@ ar@@ is , from the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O H@@ ea@@ d@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters to a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
And students both in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land and fa@@ vel@@ as in R@@ i@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o .
"A@@ ll kinds of belie@@ f@@ s , gen@@ der identi@@ ties or physi@@ cal imp@@ a@@ ir@@ ments , a ne@@ w@@ born or ter@@ min@@ ally ill ."
We all together build H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e .
Th@@ ose por@@ tra@@ its make us re@@ think how we see each other .
"When mo@@ der@@ n science is ques@@ tion@@ ing the r@@ ace con@@ cept , what does it mean for us to be black , wh@@ ite , y@@ el@@ low , red ?"
"I@@ s it the ey@@ e , the n@@ ose , the m@@ outh , the ha@@ ir ?"
"O@@ r does it have to do with our ori@@ g@@ in , n@@ ati@@ on@@ ality or b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t ?"
This pers@@ onal ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se turned out to be a disco@@ very .
S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I realized that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was u@@ se@@ ful for many people .
It re@@ pres@@ ents a sort of m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r for those who cannot find themselves re@@ fl@@ ected in any la@@ be@@ l .
It was amazing that people started to share their thou@@ ghts about the work with me .
"I have hund@@ reds of that , I will share with you , too ."
"A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old gir@@ l wr@@ ote me , &quot; &quot; V@@ ery good for me as a too@@ l to work on her con@@ fi@@ dence , as this past wee@@ k@@ end one of her gir@@ l@@ friends ar@@ gu@@ ed with her that she does not b@@ el@@ ong and should not be allo@@ wed to live in Nor@@ way ."
"So your work has a very speci@@ al place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shar@@ ed her por@@ tra@@ it on F@@ ace@@ book and wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the g@@ lo@@ be had diffic@@ ul@@ ties to place me in a group , a st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e , a box ."
P@@ er@@ haps we should stop .
"I@@ n@@ st@@ ead of fra@@ m@@ ing , ask the individu@@ al , &apos; How would you la@@ be@@ l yourself ? &apos; Th@@ en I would say , &apos; H@@ i . I &apos;m M@@ as@@ si@@ el ."
"I &apos;m a D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ D@@ ut@@ ch , I gre@@ w up in a mi@@ x@@ ed family and I &apos;m a bi@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Be@@ si@@ des these u@@ nex@@ p@@ ected and tou@@ ching re@@ ac@@ tions , H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e fin@@ ds a new life in a different vari@@ ety of fiel@@ ds ."
"@@ J@@ ust to show you some exa@@ mp@@ les , ill@@ u@@ str@@ at@@ ors and art students using it as a re@@ fer@@ ence for their s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch@@ es and their stu@@ dies ."
It &apos;s a coll@@ ection of fac@@ es .
"@@ Re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in the fiel@@ ds of an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy , phy@@ sic@@ s and neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence use H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e with different scienti@@ fic appro@@ ach@@ es re@@ l@@ ated to human e@@ th@@ n@@ ic@@ ity , op@@ t@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ o@@ logy , face recogn@@ ition or Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s ."
"One of the most important imp@@ ac@@ ts of the project is that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was ch@@ os@@ en to be the co@@ ver of F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ gn A@@ ff@@ a@@ ir@@ s , one of the most re@@ le@@ v@@ ant political publi@@ ca@@ tions ."
"And talking about fore@@ i@@ gn aff@@ a@@ ir@@ s , I found the per@@ f@@ ect am@@ b@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ ors for my project ..@@ ."
teach@@ ers .
They are the ones that use H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e as a too@@ l for edu@@ ca@@ tional pur@@ pos@@ es .
"Th@@ e@@ ir pas@@ sion enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ges me to go back to dra@@ wing cla@@ ss@@ es , but this time as a te@@ ac@@ her myself ."
"M@@ y students , both ad@@ ul@@ ts and kids , pa@@ int their self-@@ por@@ tra@@ its , trying to disco@@ ver their own uni@@ que col@@ or ."
"As a photograp@@ her , I real@@ ize that I can be a chan@@ ne@@ l for others to communi@@ cate ."
"As an individu@@ al , as An@@ g@@ é@@ li@@ ca , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sit@@ ting in front of a ther@@ ap@@ ist ."
"A@@ ll the f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion , f@@ ear and lon@@ el@@ iness that I once felt ..@@ ."
be@@ comes love .
"The last country — the last country in the world who ab@@ o@@ li@@ shed s@@ la@@ very is the country where I was born , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
We still have to work hard to ab@@ o@@ lish di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation .
"That re@@ ma@@ ins a common pr@@ acti@@ ce wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , and that will not dis@@ appe@@ ar by itself ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn k@@ id .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small v@@ il@@ la@@ ge in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ ali@@ a .
H@@ is v@@ il@@ la@@ ge is ne@@ ar M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
D@@ rought dri@@ ves the small v@@ il@@ la@@ ge into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ ith nothing left for him there , he lea@@ ves for the big city , in this case , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the cap@@ ital of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opport@@ uni@@ ties , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way for@@ ward ."
He ends up living in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"M@@ a@@ ybe a year pas@@ ses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ unch , then to din@@ ner , to brea@@ k@@ fa@@ st ."
"He me@@ ets this d@@ y@@ na@@ mic group of people , and they give him a brea@@ k ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y hi@@ m@@ self some new c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , money to s@@ end back home to his family ."
He is int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to this young woman .
He ev@@ en@@ tually gets mar@@ ri@@ ed .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ p@@ ose in life .
"One beautiful day in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , under an a@@ z@@ ure bl@@ ue sk@@ y , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn k@@ id with the big city dre@@ a@@ ms was the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ ber , and that d@@ y@@ na@@ mic group of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st organ@@ ization l@@ in@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn k@@ id just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing hi@@ m@@ self up ?
He was wa@@ iting .
"He was wa@@ iting for an opport@@ unity , wa@@ iting to beg@@ in his future , wa@@ iting for a way for@@ ward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood .
And his story re@@ pe@@ ats itself in ur@@ b@@ an cen@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ f@@ ran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ yed ur@@ b@@ an y@@ outh who sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Jo@@ h@@ an@@ ne@@ s@@ bur@@ g , sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in L@@ on@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
"For young people , the pr@@ om@@ ise of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opport@@ unity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not shar@@ ing in the pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ outh who su@@ ff@@ er from the high@@ est u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment r@@ ates .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 1@@ 8 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the gro@@ w@@ th of our cities , if we do not provi@@ de them opport@@ uni@@ ties , the story of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood , the g@@ ate@@ way to ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , to viol@@ ence , to g@@ an@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , 70 percent of young people su@@ ff@@ er from u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vi@@ s@@ it M@@ ad@@ in@@ a H@@ osp@@ ital , the h@@ osp@@ ital I was born in ."
"I remember st@@ anding in front of that b@@ ul@@ le@@ t-@@ ri@@ dd@@ en h@@ osp@@ ital thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ c@@ ed into that same state of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to h@@ ost a y@@ outh lead@@ er@@ ship and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship su@@ mm@@ it .
I b@@ rought together about 9@@ 0 young S@@ om@@ al@@ i lead@@ ers .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ inst@@ or@@ med on solu@@ tions to the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to univer@@ sity in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opport@@ uni@@ ties ."
"I remember him telling me , because he was a colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ yed , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , that he was the per@@ f@@ ect t@@ ar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st organ@@ iz@@ ations , to be rec@@ ru@@ ited ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
"In M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the big@@ gest bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ a@@ ds ."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of ci@@ vi@@ l war have completely de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed the ro@@ ad system , and a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the ea@@ si@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opport@@ unity and se@@ ized it .
He started a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He began r@@ en@@ ting out m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ kes to lo@@ cal re@@ si@@ d@@ ents who couldn &apos;t nor@@ m@@ ally aff@@ ord them .
"He b@@ ou@@ ght 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually exp@@ and to se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ red within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identi@@ f@@ y and se@@ ize a new opport@@ unity .
"It &apos;s ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship , and I believe ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship can be the most powerful too@@ l against wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
It emp@@ o@@ w@@ ers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very econom@@ ic opport@@ uni@@ ties they are so de@@ s@@ per@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , M@@ o@@ ha@@ med M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d , a fl@@ ori@@ st ."
He was help@@ ing me tra@@ in some of the young people at the su@@ mm@@ it in ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship and how to be inno@@ v@@ ative and how to create a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ ori@@ st M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until rec@@ ently , until M@@ o@@ ha@@ med came along , if you wanted flo@@ w@@ ers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used pla@@ stic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pp@@ ed from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; Wh@@ en was the last time you saw f@@ re@@ sh flo@@ w@@ ers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under ci@@ vi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So M@@ o@@ ha@@ med saw an opport@@ unity ."
He started a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , and started gro@@ wing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ lies , which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ sh M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u climate ."
"And he began deli@@ ver@@ ing flo@@ w@@ ers to we@@ dd@@ ings , cre@@ ating gar@@ d@@ ens at h@@ om@@ es and bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"He wan@@ ts to create a space where fami@@ lies , young people , can come together , and , as he says , sm@@ ell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ros@@ es ."
"And he doesn &apos;t grow ros@@ es because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first ste@@ p is to insp@@ ire young people , and in that room , M@@ o@@ ha@@ med &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the y@@ outh in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his inno@@ v@@ ation , really had a str@@ ong imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ c@@ ed them to look at their city as a place of opport@@ unity .
"He emp@@ o@@ wer@@ ed them to believe that they could be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , that they could be change ma@@ kers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with inno@@ v@@ ative solu@@ tions to some of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al solu@@ tions to lo@@ cal problems .
"So insp@@ ir@@ ing young people and cre@@ ating a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is a really great ste@@ p , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship to gu@@ i@@ de them in develop@@ ing and la@@ un@@ ching their bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
"C@@ on@@ n@@ ect young people with the re@@ sources they need , provi@@ de them the supp@@ ort they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create ca@@ tal@@ y@@ sts for ur@@ b@@ an gro@@ w@@ th ."
"For me , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social imp@@ act .
M@@ o@@ ha@@ med is not simply sel@@ ling flo@@ w@@ ers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is Pe@@ ace P@@ ark , and that &apos;s what he call@@ s it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help r@@ ent out and ma@@ in@@ tain those bi@@ kes for him .
He gave them the opport@@ unity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood .
These young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s are having a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous imp@@ act in their cities .
"So my su@@ g@@ ge@@ s@@ tion is , turn y@@ outh into ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent inno@@ v@@ ation , and you will have more stories of flo@@ w@@ ers and Pe@@ ace P@@ ar@@ ks than of car b@@ om@@ b@@ s and wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
Thank you .

( Applause ) One of the real challen@@ ges is to inno@@ v@@ ate fundam@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one te@@ ac@@ her didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"P@@ ic@@ ture this : It &apos;s M@@ on@@ day mor@@ ning , you &apos;re at the off@@ ice , you &apos;re se@@ t@@ t@@ ling in for the day at work , and this guy that you sort of recogn@@ ize from down the h@@ all , wal@@ ks right into your cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le and he ste@@ als your cha@@ ir ."
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t say a word — just ro@@ l@@ ls away with it .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your cha@@ ir out of all the other cha@@ ir@@ s that are out there .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t ac@@ knowle@@ dge the fact that you might need your cha@@ ir to get some work done today .
You w@@ ouldn &apos;t st@@ and for it . You &apos;d make a st@@ ink .
"You &apos;d fol@@ low that guy back to his cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my cha@@ ir ? &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so now it &apos;s T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning and you &apos;re at the off@@ ice , and a me@@ e@@ ting inv@@ it@@ ation pop@@ s up in your cal@@ end@@ ar ."
"( Laughter ) And it &apos;s from this woman who you kind of know from down the h@@ all , and the sub@@ ject line re@@ fer@@ ences some project that you heard a little bit about ."
But there &apos;s no ag@@ end@@ a .
There &apos;s no information about why you were inv@@ ited to the me@@ e@@ ting .
"And yet you ac@@ cept the me@@ e@@ ting inv@@ it@@ ation , and you go ."
And I &apos;m talking about something far more val@@ u@@ able than off@@ ice f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure .
I &apos;m talking about time . Y@@ our time .
"In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global ep@@ ide@@ mic of a ter@@ ri@@ ble new ill@@ ness known as M@@ A@@ S : M@@ in@@ d@@ less A@@ c@@ cept S@@ y@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ."
( Laughter ) The pri@@ mar@@ y sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m of M@@ in@@ d@@ less A@@ c@@ cept S@@ y@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is just ac@@ cep@@ ting a me@@ e@@ ting inv@@ it@@ ation the min@@ u@@ te it pop@@ s up in your cal@@ end@@ ar . ( Laughter )
"It &apos;s an inv@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ f@@ le@@ x — ding , c@@ li@@ ck , b@@ ing — it &apos;s in your cal@@ end@@ ar , &quot; &quot; G@@ ot@@ t@@ a go , I &apos;m already l@@ ate for a me@@ e@@ ting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) M@@ e@@ et@@ ings are important , right ?"
And coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation is key to the suc@@ cess of any en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se .
"And a w@@ ell@@ -@@ run me@@ e@@ ting can y@@ i@@ el@@ d really pos@@ i@@ tive , ac@@ tion@@ able resul@@ ts ."
"But between glob@@ al@@ ization and per@@ va@@ sive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally over the last few years ."
"And we &apos;re mi@@ ser@@ able . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re mi@@ ser@@ able not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good me@@ e@@ ting , it &apos;s because of M@@ A@@ S , our M@@ in@@ d@@ less A@@ c@@ cept S@@ y@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , which is a self-@@ inf@@ lic@@ ted w@@ ound ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , I have evi@@ dence to pro@@ ve that M@@ A@@ S is a global ep@@ ide@@ mic ."
Let me tell you why .
"A couple of years ago , I put a video on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be , and in the video , I ac@@ ted out every ter@@ ri@@ ble conf@@ er@@ ence call you &apos;ve ever been on ."
"It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we h@@ ate about really bad me@@ et@@ ings ."
There &apos;s the mo@@ der@@ ator who has no idea how to run the me@@ e@@ ting .
There are the par@@ tici@@ p@@ ants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
The whole thing kind of coll@@ ap@@ ses into this coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative tra@@ in w@@ rec@@ k .
And everybody lea@@ ves very an@@ gr@@ y .
It &apos;s kind of fun@@ n@@ y .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quic@@ k look .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an ag@@ ree@@ ment on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .
"As a group , we need to deci@@ de if — bloo@@ p bloo@@ p — H@@ i , who just jo@@ ined ?"
"H@@ i , it &apos;s Jo@@ e . I &apos;m working from home today ."
"( Laughter ) H@@ i , Jo@@ e . Th@@ an@@ ks for jo@@ ining us today , great ."
"I was just saying , we have a lot of people on the call we &apos;d like to get through , so let &apos;s s@@ ki@@ p the ro@@ ll call and I &apos;m g@@ on@@ n@@ a di@@ ve right in ."
O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an ag@@ ree@@ ment on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .
"As a group , we need to deci@@ de if — bloo@@ p bloo@@ p — ( Laughter ) H@@ i , who just jo@@ ined ?"
No ? I thought I heard a be@@ ep . ( Laughter ) S@@ ound fami@@ li@@ ar ?
"@@ Y@@ eah , it s@@ ounds fami@@ li@@ ar to me , too ."
"A couple of weeks after I put that on@@ line , 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in do@@ z@@ ens of countries , I mean do@@ z@@ ens of countries , wat@@ ched this video ."
"And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of vi@@ e@@ ws every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
"And in fact , some of the big@@ gest companies in the world , companies that you &apos;ve heard of but I won &apos;t name , have asked for my per@@ mis@@ sion to use this video in their ne@@ w@@ -@@ h@@ ire tra@@ ining to te@@ ach their new emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es how not to run a me@@ e@@ ting at their company ."
"And if the numbers — there are a million vi@@ e@@ ws and it &apos;s being used by all these companies — ar@@ en &apos;t enough pro@@ of that we have a global problem with me@@ et@@ ings , there are the many , many thousands of comm@@ ents pos@@ ted on@@ line after the video went up ."
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people wr@@ ote things like , &quot; O@@ M@@ G , that was my day today ! &quot;"
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
"One guy wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y because it &apos;s true ."
"E@@ eri@@ ly , sa@@ d@@ ly , de@@ pre@@ ss@@ ing@@ ly true ."
It made me la@@ u@@ gh until I cri@@ ed .
"And cri@@ ed . And I cri@@ ed some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My da@@ i@@ ly life until re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment or de@@ ath , si@@ gh . &quot;"
These are real quot@@ es and it &apos;s real sa@@ d .
A common the@@ me run@@ ning through all of these comm@@ ents on@@ line is this fundam@@ ental belie@@ f that we are power@@ less to do anything other than go to me@@ et@@ ings and su@@ ff@@ er through these po@@ or@@ ly run me@@ et@@ ings and live to me@@ et another day .
"But the tru@@ th is , we &apos;re not power@@ less at all ."
"In fact , the c@@ ure for M@@ A@@ S is right here in our hands ."
"It &apos;s right at our fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ ps , liter@@ ally ."
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No M@@ A@@ S !
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich , if I remember my high school S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , means something like , &quot; &quot; En@@ ough already , make it stop ! &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how No M@@ A@@ S works . It &apos;s very simple ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , the next time you get a me@@ e@@ ting inv@@ it@@ ation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , c@@ li@@ ck the ten@@ ta@@ tive bu@@ t@@ ton !@@ "
"It &apos;s o@@ kay , you &apos;re allo@@ wed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there ."
It &apos;s right next to the ac@@ cept bu@@ t@@ ton .
"O@@ r the maybe bu@@ t@@ ton , or wh@@ ate@@ ver bu@@ t@@ ton is there for you not to ac@@ cept im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"Th@@ en , get in tou@@ ch with the person who asked you to the me@@ e@@ ting ."
"T@@ ell them you &apos;re very exc@@ ited to supp@@ ort their work , ask them what the go@@ al of the me@@ e@@ ting is , and tell them you &apos;re interest@@ ed in learning how you can help them ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve their go@@ al ."
"And if we do this often enough , and we do it re@@ spec@@ t@@ fully , people might start to be a little bit more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful about the way they put together me@@ e@@ ting inv@@ it@@ ations ."
And you can make more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful deci@@ sions about ac@@ cep@@ ting it .
People might actually start sen@@ ding out ag@@ end@@ as . I@@ ma@@ gine !
O@@ r they might not have a conf@@ er@@ ence call with 12 people to talk about a st@@ at@@ us when they could just do a quic@@ k e@@ ma@@ il and get it done with .
People just might start to change their behavi@@ or because you changed y@@ ours .
"And they just might bring your cha@@ ir back , too . ( Laughter ) No M@@ A@@ S !@@ "
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
And even bl@@ ind bab@@ ies s@@ mi@@ le to the sound of the human vo@@ ice .
No .
That &apos;s not how to think of a TED T@@ al@@ k .
And it &apos;s this : Y@@ our number one t@@ ask as a spea@@ ker is to trans@@ f@@ er into your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary gi@@ ft — a str@@ an@@ ge and beautiful ob@@ ject that we call an idea .
Let me show you what I mean .
Here &apos;s H@@ al@@ ey .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) P@@ re@@ sen@@ ter : H@@ al@@ ey V@@ an D@@ y@@ ck !
"( Applause ) O@@ ver the course of 1@@ 8 minutes , 1@@ ,@@ 200 people , many of wh@@ om have never seen each other before , are fin@@ ding that their bra@@ ins are star@@ ting to sy@@ n@@ c with H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain and with each other ."
They &apos;re liter@@ ally begin@@ ning to ex@@ hi@@ bit the same bra@@ in@@ -@@ wa@@ ve pat@@ ter@@ ns .
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feel@@ ing the same emoti@@ ons .
There &apos;s something even more star@@ t@@ ling happening .
Let &apos;s take a look inside H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are b@@ illions of inter@@ connec@@ ted neur@@ ons in an imp@@ os@@ sible t@@ ang@@ le .
"But look here , right here — a few million of them are l@@ in@@ ked to each other in a way which re@@ pres@@ ents a single idea ."
"And incredi@@ bly , this ex@@ act pat@@ ter@@ n is being re@@ created in real time inside the min@@ ds of everyone list@@ ening ."
"That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a pat@@ ter@@ n inv@@ ol@@ ving m@@ illions of neur@@ ons is being t@@ el@@ ep@@ or@@ ted into 1@@ ,@@ 200 min@@ ds , just by people list@@ ening to a vo@@ ice and wat@@ ching a face ."
But wa@@ it — what is an idea any@@ way ?
"Well , you can think of it as a pat@@ ter@@ n of information that hel@@ ps you understand and na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world ."
Here are just a few exa@@ mp@@ les shar@@ ed from the TED st@@ age .
S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son — cre@@ ati@@ vity is key to our kids &apos; future .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : E@@ l@@ or@@ a H@@ ar@@ dy — building from b@@ am@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) E@@ l@@ or@@ a H@@ ar@@ dy : It is gro@@ wing all around us , it &apos;s str@@ ong , it &apos;s ele@@ g@@ ant , it &apos;s ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke@@ -@@ re@@ sist@@ ant ."
C@@ A : C@@ hi@@ ma@@ m@@ and@@ a A@@ di@@ ch@@ i@@ e — people are more than a single identi@@ ty .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) C@@ hi@@ ma@@ m@@ and@@ a A@@ di@@ ch@@ i@@ e : The single story cre@@ ates st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , and the problem with st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are in@@ comple@@ te ."
"C@@ A : Y@@ our mind is te@@ em@@ ing with ideas , and not just r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ."
They &apos;re care@@ fully l@@ in@@ ked together .
C@@ ol@@ l@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely they form an ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly comple@@ x structure that is your pers@@ onal wor@@ l@@ d@@ view .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s oper@@ ating system .
It &apos;s how you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world .
And it is built up out of m@@ illions of individu@@ al ideas .
"So , for example , if one little comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that k@@ it@@ ten@@ s are ad@@ or@@ able , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act like this ."
"But if another comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds are d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act a little bit differ@@ ently ."
"So , it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous why the ideas that make up your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view are c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al ."
"You need them to be as reli@@ able as possible — a gu@@ i@@ de , to the sc@@ ary but wonder@@ ful real world out there ."
"Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vi@@ e@@ ws can be dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally different ."
"For example , how does your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view re@@ act when you see this image : ( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ ali@@ a M@@ o@@ ga@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?"
"@@ &quot; &quot; A woman of fa@@ ith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exper@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a si@@ ster &quot; &quot; ?"
"O@@ r &quot; &quot; op@@ pre@@ ssed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ in@@ wa@@ shed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st &quot; &quot; ?"
"C@@ A : Wh@@ ate@@ ver your answer , there are m@@ illions of people out there who would re@@ act very differ@@ ently ."
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
"If communi@@ cated pro@@ per@@ ly , they &apos;re cap@@ able of chan@@ ging , fore@@ ver , how someone thin@@ ks about the world , and sh@@ ap@@ ing their ac@@ tions both now and well into the future ."
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful for@@ ce sh@@ ap@@ ing human culture .
"So if you ac@@ cept that your number one t@@ ask as a spea@@ ker is to build an idea inside the min@@ ds of your au@@ di@@ ence , here are four gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines for how you should go about that t@@ ask : One , lim@@ it your talk to just one maj@@ or idea ."
"I@@ de@@ as are comple@@ x things ; you need to s@@ la@@ sh back your cont@@ ent so that you can foc@@ us on the single idea you &apos;re most pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate about , and give yourself a chan@@ ce to expla@@ in that one thing pro@@ per@@ ly ."
"You have to give cont@@ ext , share exa@@ mp@@ les , make it vi@@ vi@@ d ."
"So pic@@ k one idea , and make it the throu@@ gh@@ -@@ line run@@ ning through your entire talk , so that everything you say l@@ in@@ ks back to it in some way ."
"T@@ w@@ o , give your list@@ en@@ ers a reason to care ."
"@@ Be@@ fore you can start building things inside the min@@ ds of your au@@ di@@ ence , you have to get their per@@ mis@@ sion to w@@ el@@ come you in ."
And the ma@@ in too@@ l to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve that ?
C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
S@@ ti@@ r your au@@ di@@ ence &apos;s cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"@@ U@@ se in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing , pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive questions to identi@@ f@@ y why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs expla@@ ining ."
"If you can re@@ ve@@ al a dis@@ connec@@ tion in someone &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ view , they &apos;ll feel the need to bri@@ dge that knowle@@ dge ga@@ p ."
"And once you &apos;ve sp@@ ar@@ ked that desi@@ re , it will be so much ea@@ si@@ er to start building your idea ."
"Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of con@@ cep@@ ts that your au@@ di@@ ence already underst@@ ands ."
"You use the power of language to w@@ ea@@ ve together con@@ cep@@ ts that already ex@@ ist in your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds — but not your language , their language ."
You start where they are .
The spea@@ kers often for@@ get that many of the terms and con@@ cep@@ ts they live with are completely un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar to their au@@ di@@ ences .
"Now , me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors can play a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al ro@@ le in sho@@ wing how the piec@@ es f@@ it together , because they re@@ ve@@ al the desi@@ red sh@@ ape of the pat@@ ter@@ n , based on an idea that the list@@ en@@ er already underst@@ ands ."
"For example , when J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er K@@ a@@ h@@ n wanted to expla@@ in the incredi@@ ble new bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy called C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word pro@@ cess@@ or to ed@@ it DNA ."
"C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R allo@@ ws you to c@@ ut and pa@@ st@@ e gen@@ e@@ tic information really ea@@ si@@ ly . &quot; &quot; Now , a vi@@ vi@@ d ex@@ plan@@ ation like that deli@@ ver@@ s a sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying a@@ h@@ a moment as it s@@ n@@ aps into place in our min@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s important , ther@@ e@@ fore , to test your talk on tru@@ sted friends , and find out which parts they get conf@@ used by ."
"F@@ our , here &apos;s the fin@@ al ti@@ p : Ma@@ ke your idea wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
"B@@ y that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Wh@@ o does this idea b@@ ene@@ f@@ it ? &quot;"
And I need you to be hon@@ est with the answer .
"If the idea only ser@@ ves you or your organ@@ ization , then , I &apos;m sor@@ ry to say , it &apos;s probably not wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
The au@@ di@@ ence will see right through you .
"C@@ an I ask you to p@@ lease rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ d@@ ly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ c@@ ed by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ pos@@ ition ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.@@ S@@ . today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to brea@@ k mat@@ h down into two ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with lead@@ ing co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really str@@ ong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ li@@ cation of mat@@ h pro@@ cess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h te@@ ac@@ her ."
"So first , five sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your cla@@ ss@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of ini@@ ti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your l@@ ec@@ ture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five hands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ expla@@ in the entire thing at their de@@ s@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ o@@ le@@ s@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is ea@@ g@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to app@@ ly in that situ@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; D@@ ea@@ d@@ w@@ ood &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary dra@@ m@@ a , sho@@ ws set in the pres@@ ent day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ resp@@ ect , it sh@@ ap@@ es the ne@@ ural pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an imp@@ ati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ solu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re imp@@ ati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ solve quickly ."
"You exp@@ ect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al brea@@ ks and a la@@ u@@ gh tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and w@@ ell@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks — partic@@ ul@@ arly ma@@ ss@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a phy@@ sic@@ s t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"N@@ ot@@ ice , first of all here , that you have exactly three piec@@ es of information there , each of which will figure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the stud@@ ent will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the pr@@ acti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and tw@@ ea@@ king the cont@@ ext a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t recogn@@ ize the st@@ am@@ p this was m@@ ol@@ ded from , it help@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sa@@ mple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any phy@@ sic@@ s , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ o@@ de a t@@ ex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a sha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ fic@@ ally in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really c@@ ool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ p@@ e using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers and , partic@@ ul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pre@@ ssed together and pre@@ sen@@ ted to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this imp@@ ati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ f@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical structure , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , l@@ ab@@ els , po@@ in@@ ts , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ elling question , a comp@@ elling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight p@@ ath from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small cr@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ?"
And this star@@ ts conver@@ sa@@ tion because the vi@@ su@@ al is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ su@@ s friend , in pa@@ ir@@ s , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ ate@@ ver ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we real@@ ize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ o@@ ve the mi@@ d line .
"And we real@@ ize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D l@@ ab@@ els to talk about them more ea@@ si@@ ly ."
"And then as we start to de@@ f@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we real@@ ize it would be n@@ ice to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ ar@@ row it down , speci@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical structure ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the conver@@ sa@@ tion , the conver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cla@@ ss@@ es are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ p@@ e , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my pr@@ acti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ in@@ ste@@ in , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ulation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pr@@ acti@@ ce , in the U.@@ S@@ . here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the form@@ ulation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ elling el@@ em@@ ents of problems like this from my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that supp@@ or@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then not@@ ice that all the information wr@@ it@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ str@@ ac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted question in mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or c@@ li@@ p art that you so often see in t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone f@@ ill@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ing up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the h@@ oo@@ k , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a conver@@ sa@@ tion about mat@@ h because someone else has the form@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level pla@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ed something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally and conver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ ining the conver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical mo@@ d@@ els that always work out in the answer key in the back of a te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sources of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those conver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ p@@ ort some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ uses day one of the cla@@ ss .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , t@@ ot@@ ally new , t@@ ot@@ ally fore@@ i@@ gn , and they &apos;ll have a conver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ ver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h teach@@ ers I talk to to use mul@@ ti@@ media , because it br@@ ings the real world into your cla@@ ss@@ room in high re@@ solu@@ tion and full col@@ or ; to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pla@@ ying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you pos@@ si@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in conver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ in@@ ste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in t@@ ot@@ al , just be less help@@ ful , because the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book is help@@ ing you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less help@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h te@@ ac@@ her right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our front po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly ch@@ ea@@ p , and the to@@ ols to di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te it f@@ ree@@ ly under open li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ aper or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vi@@ e@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ s@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , y@@ eah . We had a good conver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ e@@ ms or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ e@@ ms ."
"And the l@@ in@@ ear mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing inv@@ olved in that was some good stuff for my cla@@ ss@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge you , wh@@ ate@@ ver your sta@@ ke is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , te@@ ac@@ her , poli@@ cy ma@@ ker , wh@@ ate@@ ver — in@@ si@@ st on better mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pla@@ stic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ n@@ a att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a g@@ la@@ ss win@@ d@@ ow in S@@ a@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the b@@ ack@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
I was born and ra@@ is@@ ed in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ though my family con@@ st@@ antly str@@ ug@@ g@@ led against po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ gest of two in the family ."
But then the great fa@@ m@@ ine began in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My si@@ ster and I would go sear@@ ching for fi@@ re@@ w@@ ood star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mi@@ d@@ night .
"I would wan@@ der the st@@ ree@@ ts sear@@ ching for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating ch@@ i@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
"For a h@@ un@@ gr@@ y child , poli@@ tics and f@@ ree@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"O@@ n my n@@ in@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the hea@@ v@@ iness in their hear@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans died of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and di@@ e .
"In the same year , my mother dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed one day , and then my si@@ ster told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ ince we had never been se@@ par@@ ated , and I thought we would be together fore@@ ver , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the big@@ gest mi@@ sta@@ ke I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
I have not seen my mo@@ m or my si@@ ster since then .
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , I became an or@@ p@@ ha@@ n and h@@ om@@ el@@ ess ."
"M@@ y da@@ i@@ ly life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a du@@ st@@ y piece of b@@ read in the tra@@ sh .
But that is no way to survi@@ ve .
"I started to real@@ ize , beg@@ ging would not be the solu@@ tion ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ le@@ g@@ al mar@@ ke@@ ts .
"S@@ ome@@ times , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even spent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al m@@ ine , 3@@ 3 me@@ ters under@@ ground without any prot@@ ection for up to 1@@ 6 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans survi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from b@@ it@@ ter co@@ ld or h@@ un@@ ger pa@@ ins , I hop@@ ed that , the next mor@@ ning , my si@@ ster would come back to wa@@ ke me up with my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hope ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , gr@@ and hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tra@@ sh can had b@@ read , even though it u@@ su@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would di@@ e ."
H@@ op@@ e ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of wa@@ iting for my si@@ ster &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I realized I couldn &apos;t survi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ri@@ sk@@ y , but I would be ris@@ king my life either way ."
"I could di@@ e of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tried to c@@ ross the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time to a@@ vo@@ id being seen .
Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an bor@@ der gu@@ ar@@ ds often sh@@ oo@@ t and k@@ ill people trying to c@@ ross the bor@@ der without per@@ mis@@ sion .
"@@ Chin@@ ese sol@@ di@@ ers will ca@@ t@@ ch and s@@ end back Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , where they face se@@ v@@ ere p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment ."
"I decided to c@@ ross during the day , first because I was still a k@@ id and sc@@ ar@@ ed of the d@@ ark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to c@@ ross during the day , I thought I might be able to c@@ ross without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 1@@ 6 years old .
"I thought things in China would be ea@@ si@@ er , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ri@@ ed about being ca@@ ught and s@@ ent back .
"B@@ y a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , some months later , I met someone who was run@@ ning an under@@ ground sh@@ el@@ ter for Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , and was allo@@ wed to live there and e@@ at re@@ gu@@ lar me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"L@@ ater that year , an acti@@ vi@@ st help@@ ed me es@@ cap@@ e China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of Eng@@ lish , yet my social wor@@ ker told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , I was an F stud@@ ent ."
( Laughter ) And I b@@ are@@ ly fin@@ i@@ shed el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
And I remember I f@@ ou@@ ght in school more than once a day .
T@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks and the li@@ br@@ ary were not my pla@@ y@@ ground .
"M@@ y father tried very hard to m@@ oti@@ v@@ ate me into stud@@ ying , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"A@@ t one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it h@@ ur@@ t me de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , my level of m@@ oti@@ v@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he died ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my f@@ os@@ ter mother had made ch@@ ic@@ ken w@@ ings for din@@ ner ."
"And during din@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pl@@ ate , I saw the last ch@@ ic@@ ken wing , that my f@@ os@@ ter father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him sit@@ ting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words ."
S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed my bio@@ logical father .
"M@@ y f@@ os@@ ter father &apos;s small act of love re@@ min@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was h@@ un@@ gr@@ y , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so su@@ ff@@ o@@ cated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation ."
"M@@ y only w@@ ish that night was to c@@ oo@@ k a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to hon@@ or him ."
And my answer was to pr@@ om@@ ise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to hon@@ or his s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice .
"I took school ser@@ i@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I re@@ cei@@ ved an a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic a@@ ward for exc@@ ell@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s li@@ st from the first se@@ me@@ ster in high school ."
( Applause ) That ch@@ ic@@ ken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ op@@ e is pers@@ onal . H@@ op@@ e is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
"In Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , I made it myself ."
H@@ op@@ e b@@ rought me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing f@@ ree@@ dom ."
"M@@ y f@@ os@@ ter father at that din@@ ner gave me a direc@@ tion , and he m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated me and gave me a pur@@ p@@ ose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people help@@ ed me along the way to get here .
Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans are fi@@ gh@@ ting hard to survi@@ ve .
"They have to for@@ ce themselves to survi@@ ve , have hope to survi@@ ve , but they cannot make it without help ."
This is my messa@@ ge to you .
"H@@ a@@ ve hope for yourself , but also help each other ."
"L@@ i@@ fe can be hard for everyone , wh@@ er@@ ever you live ."
My f@@ os@@ ter father didn &apos;t int@@ end to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the sm@@ al@@ le@@ st act of love ."
"A piece of b@@ read can sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y your h@@ un@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you b@@ read to keep you ali@@ ve ."
But I con@@ fi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also sa@@ ve another J@@ os@@ ep@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other J@@ os@@ e@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : J@@ os@@ ep@@ h , th@@ ank you for shar@@ ing that very pers@@ onal and speci@@ al story with us ."
"I know you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen your si@@ ster for , you said , it was almost exactly a deca@@ de , and in the off chan@@ ce that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opport@@ unity to s@@ end her a messa@@ ge ."

"( Laughter ) J@@ K : O@@ kay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in K@@ o@@ re@@ an because I don &apos;t think I can make it without t@@ ear@@ ing up ."
"N@@ un@@ a , it has been already 10 years that I ha@@ ven ’ t seen you ."
"I just wanted to say that I mi@@ ss you , and I love you , and p@@ lease come back to me and st@@ ay ali@@ ve ."

"( Laughter ) Y@@ es , I &apos;m just looking for@@ ward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."
And can I also make a small messa@@ ge to my mo@@ m ?
"A@@ H : S@@ ure , p@@ lease ."
"@@ J@@ K : I ha@@ ven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pr@@ ay for me and think about me ."
I just wanted to say th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me be in this world .

( Applause )
How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a di@@ stor@@ ted sequ@@ ence of char@@ ac@@ ters like this ?
"@@ How many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ st@@ anding . So I inv@@ en@@ ted that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty f@@ ill@@ ing out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer progra@@ m that was wr@@ it@@ ten to sub@@ m@@ it the form m@@ illions and m@@ illions of times ."
"The reason it works is because humans , at least non@@ -@@ vi@@ su@@ all@@ y-@@ imp@@ ai@@ red humans , have no tr@@ ou@@ ble read@@ ing these di@@ stor@@ ted squ@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ ly char@@ ac@@ ters , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as computer progra@@ ms simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , the reason you have to typ@@ e these di@@ stor@@ ted char@@ ac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from wr@@ iting a progra@@ m that can bu@@ y m@@ illions of tic@@ ke@@ ts , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ ci@@ se sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that is sh@@ own to the us@@ er is not so for@@ tun@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o regi@@ stra@@ tion p@@ age .
"The ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that happened to be sh@@ own to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word ."
But the best part is the messa@@ ge that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help de@@ s@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ext : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wa@@ iting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this poor person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A P@@ ro@@ ject is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"@@ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next ev@@ olution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Goo@@ gle actually ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the follo@@ wing real@@ ization : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are typ@@ ed every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite p@@ rou@@ d of myself ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my research has had ."
But then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you typ@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , ess@@ enti@@ ally you wa@@ st@@ e 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you mul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly that by 200 million , you get that human@@ ity as a whole is wa@@ sting about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day typ@@ ing these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the sec@@ ur@@ ity of the W@@ e@@ b sort of dep@@ ends on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this eff@@ ort for something that is good for human@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do u@@ se@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of pu@@ tting it is , is there some hum@@ on@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get compu@@ ters to solve , yet we can sp@@ li@@ t into tin@@ y 1@@ 0@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they solve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys while you &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ enti@@ ca@@ ting yourself as a human , but in ad@@ di@@ tion you &apos;re actually help@@ ing us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks ."
So let me expla@@ in how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of pro@@ jects out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks .
Goo@@ gle has one . The Internet Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve has one .
"A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ d@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks ."
B@@ a@@ sically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? L@@ i@@ ke a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ an@@ ning a book is like taking a di@@ g@@ ital photograp@@ h of every p@@ age of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every p@@ age of the book .
This is an image with t@@ ext for every p@@ age of the book .
The next ste@@ p in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical char@@ ac@@ ter recogn@@ ition , which takes a picture of t@@ ext and tries to figure out what t@@ ext is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not per@@ f@@ ect .
"E@@ speci@@ ally for ol@@ der boo@@ ks where the ink has f@@ ad@@ ed and the p@@ ages have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R cannot recogn@@ ize a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were wr@@ it@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recogn@@ ize about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recogn@@ ize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you typ@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re typ@@ ing are actually words that are coming from boo@@ ks that are being di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ed that the computer could not recogn@@ ize ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to pres@@ ent it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , p@@ lease typ@@ e both ."
"And if you typ@@ e the cor@@ rec@@ t word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it as@@ su@@ m@@ es you are human , and it also gets some con@@ fi@@ dence that you typ@@ ed the other word cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ed ac@@ cur@@ ately ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we re@@ le@@ ased it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ sit@@ es have started s@@ wit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people wa@@ sted their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are help@@ ing to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks ."
"So for example , T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster ."
"So every time you bu@@ y tic@@ ke@@ ts on T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ wit@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other sit@@ es are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of sit@@ es that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million boo@@ ks a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typ@@ ing C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ n@@ y things can happen ."
And this is esp@@ eci@@ ally true because now we &apos;re giving people two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en Eng@@ lish words next to each other .
So fun@@ n@@ y things can happen .
"For example , we pre@@ sen@@ ted this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you pres@@ ent it along with another r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ext : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite where we sho@@ wed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of G@@ od ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ext : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ sul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ sul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re pre@@ sen@@ ting two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given ri@@ se to a really big Internet me@@ me that ten@@ s of thousands of people have par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ ma@@ gine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ext : in@@ vi@@ sible to@@ a@@ ster ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re supp@@ os@@ ed to do is you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t , and then you dra@@ w something that is re@@ l@@ ated to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very cu@@ te . ( T@@ ext : cl@@ en@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ext : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like p@@ al@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logical sh@@ vi@@ s@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ op D@@ o@@ g@@ g . ( Laughter )@@ "
"O@@ kay , so this is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of dist@@ inc@@ t people that have help@@ ed us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has help@@ ed us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowle@@ dge ."
And it is numbers like these that m@@ oti@@ v@@ ate my research ag@@ end@@ a .
"So the question that m@@ oti@@ v@@ ates my research is the follo@@ wing : If you look at human@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ em@@ ents , these really big things that human@@ ity has g@@ ot@@ ten together and done hi@@ stor@@ ic@@ ally — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or the P@@ an@@ am@@ a C@@ an@@ al or pu@@ tting a man on the M@@ o@@ on — there is a cu@@ ri@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ird ; they were all done with about 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people , let alone pa@@ ying them , was ess@@ enti@@ ally imp@@ os@@ sible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sh@@ own you a project where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowle@@ dge ."
"So the question that m@@ oti@@ v@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the M@@ o@@ on with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different pro@@ jects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t yet been la@@ un@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ ince it ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t been la@@ un@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Y@@ eah , I can tr@@ ust you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent , S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ack@@ er ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ack@@ er ."
So I pos@@ ed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ rec@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ack@@ er ."
So I pos@@ ed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is par@@ ti@@ tion@@ ed into mul@@ ti@@ ple langu@@ ages .
A large f@@ r@@ action of it is in Eng@@ lish .
"If you don &apos;t know any Eng@@ lish , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"But there &apos;s large f@@ r@@ ac@@ tions in other different langu@@ ages , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ages , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ l@@ ate all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to trans@@ l@@ ate ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ lation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ lation no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is star@@ ting to trans@@ l@@ ate some s@@ ent@@ ences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mi@@ sta@@ kes .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mi@@ sta@@ ke , since it makes so many mi@@ sta@@ kes , you don &apos;t know whether to tr@@ ust it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ l@@ ated with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um p@@ ost .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ l@@ ated from J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese into Eng@@ lish .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ l@@ ated with a computer .
So the next s@@ ent@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expla@@ ining something .
"@@ Re@@ member , it &apos;s a question about J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ext : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time inst@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : How many times like the w@@ ind , a po@@ le , and the dra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : This in@@ sul@@ t to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ext : P@@ lease ap@@ o@@ logi@@ ze for your stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so computer trans@@ lation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?"
We could pay prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it would be extre@@ me@@ ly exp@@ en@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ l@@ ating a tin@@ y , tin@@ y f@@ r@@ action of the whole W@@ e@@ b , W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , into one other language , S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia ex@@ i@@ sts in S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small com@@ par@@ ed to the size of Eng@@ lish ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of Eng@@ lish .
"If we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate the other 80 percent into S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exp@@ lo@@ ited , out@@ sour@@ c@@ ing country out there ."
So it would be very exp@@ en@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly real@@ ize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big h@@ ur@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of b@@ il@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there ex@@ i@@ sts 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are b@@ il@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ l@@ ate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a l@@ ack of m@@ oti@@ v@@ ation .
How are we going to m@@ oti@@ v@@ ate people to actually trans@@ l@@ ate the W@@ e@@ b for free ?
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , you have to pay people to do this ."
So how are we going to m@@ oti@@ v@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were blo@@ c@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solu@@ tion ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two bir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ lation into something that m@@ illions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of b@@ il@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people learning a fore@@ i@@ gn language ."
"@@ People really , really want to learn a fore@@ i@@ gn language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ c@@ ed to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have pa@@ id over $ 5@@ 00 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ s@@ ite — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the ba@@ si@@ c idea is people learn a new language for free while si@@ mul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a begin@@ ner , we give you very , very simple s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple s@@ ent@@ ences on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple s@@ ent@@ ences along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ l@@ ate them , and as you see how other people trans@@ l@@ ate them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more adv@@ anc@@ ed , we give you more and more comple@@ x s@@ ent@@ ences to trans@@ l@@ ate ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the cra@@ z@@ y thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re m@@ os@@ tly done building it , and now we &apos;re te@@ sting it ."
People really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the lead@@ ing language learning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real cont@@ ent ."
"As op@@ pos@@ ed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up s@@ ent@@ ences , people are learning with real cont@@ ent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more surpri@@ sing@@ ly , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get from people using the s@@ ite , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ n@@ ers , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get are as ac@@ cur@@ ate as those of prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors , which is very surpri@@ sing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a s@@ ent@@ ence that was trans@@ l@@ ated from G@@ er@@ man into Eng@@ lish .
The top is the G@@ er@@ man .
The middle is an Eng@@ lish trans@@ lation that was done by somebody who was a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal Eng@@ lish trans@@ l@@ ator who we pa@@ id 20 c@@ ents a word for this trans@@ lation .
"And the bot@@ to@@ m is a trans@@ lation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any G@@ er@@ man before they started using the s@@ ite ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much per@@ f@@ ect ."
"Now of course , we play a tri@@ ck here to make the trans@@ la@@ tions as good as prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the trans@@ la@@ tions of mul@@ ti@@ ple begin@@ n@@ ers to get the qu@@ ality of a single prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal trans@@ l@@ ator .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ b@@ ining the trans@@ la@@ tions , the s@@ ite actually can trans@@ l@@ ate pretty fa@@ st ."
"So let me show you , this is our es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es of how fa@@ st we could trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia from Eng@@ lish into S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"@@ Re@@ member , this is 50 million dol@@ lar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of val@@ ue ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia into S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , we could do it in five weeks with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ ince all the pro@@ jects that my group has worked on so far have g@@ ot@@ ten m@@ illions of us@@ ers , we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ l@@ ate extre@@ me@@ ly fa@@ st with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this provi@@ des a fa@@ ir business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The curr@@ ent business model for language education is the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys , and in particular , the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys R@@ os@@ et@@ t@@ a St@@ one 5@@ 00 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the curr@@ ent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 5@@ 00 dollars .
So it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ fa@@ ir to@@ wards the poor .
This is t@@ ot@@ ally bi@@ ased to@@ wards the ri@@ ch .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating val@@ ue , you &apos;re trans@@ l@@ ating stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ la@@ tions ."
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
"S@@ ince people are cre@@ ating val@@ ue while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time ."
"But the ma@@ gi@@ cal thing here is that they &apos;re pa@@ ying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the n@@ ice thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it provi@@ des a fa@@ ir business model — one that doesn &apos;t di@@ scri@@ min@@ ate against poor people .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the s@@ ite .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched , but if you go there , you can si@@ gn up to be part of our pri@@ v@@ ate be@@ t@@ a , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really aw@@ es@@ ome team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .

"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic doc@@ tor , who was very un@@ u@@ su@@ al , nam@@ ed A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t ."
"And A@@ li@@ ce was un@@ u@@ su@@ al par@@ tly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty r@@ are in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ."
"And she was bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ gest F@@ el@@ low to be elec@@ ted to the R@@ o@@ y@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans ."
"S@@ he was un@@ u@@ su@@ al too because she contin@@ u@@ ed to work after she got mar@@ ri@@ ed , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed and was a single par@@ ent , she contin@@ u@@ ed her medi@@ cal work ."
"And she was un@@ u@@ su@@ al because she was really interest@@ ed in a new science , the e@@ mer@@ ging field of ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ o@@ logy , the study of pat@@ ter@@ ns in disease ."
"But like every scienti@@ st , she ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it ."
The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ris@@ ing in@@ ci@@ dence of chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood canc@@ ers .
"M@@ ost disease is cor@@ re@@ l@@ ated with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the case of chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood canc@@ ers , the children who were d@@ ying se@@ em@@ ed m@@ os@@ tly to come from aff@@ l@@ u@@ ent fami@@ lies ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could expla@@ in this an@@ om@@ al@@ y ?"
"Now , A@@ li@@ ce had tr@@ ou@@ ble getting fund@@ ing for her research ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 p@@ ounds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ at@@ a M@@ em@@ ori@@ al pri@@ ze ."
And that me@@ ant she knew she only had one sho@@ t at coll@@ ec@@ ting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a nee@@ d@@ le in a ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ at@@ en bo@@ il@@ ed s@@ wee@@ ts ?
H@@ ad they con@@ su@@ med co@@ lo@@ red dr@@ in@@ ks ?
D@@ id they e@@ at fish and ch@@ i@@ ps ?
D@@ id they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ b@@ on cop@@ i@@ ed ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire started to come back , one thing and one thing only ju@@ mp@@ ed out with the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cal cl@@ ar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a r@@ ate of two to one , the children who had died had had mo@@ thers who had been X@@ -@@ ra@@ yed when pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
Now that fin@@ ding f@@ le@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom .
"C@@ on@@ v@@ enti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom hel@@ d that everything was sa@@ fe up to a point , a thre@@ sho@@ ld ."
"It f@@ le@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom , which was huge en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m for the c@@ ool new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ r@@ ay machine ."
"And it f@@ le@@ w in the face of doc@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who help@@ ed patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ e@@ ver@@ the@@ less , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t ru@@ shed to publi@@ sh her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ d@@ ings in The L@@ anc@@ et in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"@@ People got very exc@@ ited , there was talk of the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big h@@ ur@@ ry to try to study all the ca@@ ses of chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood cancer she could find before they dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed ."
"In fact , she need not have h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed ."
It was fully 25 years before the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh and medi@@ cal — B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh and American medi@@ cal est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ments ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed the pr@@ acti@@ ce of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ gn@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was f@@ ree@@ ly a@@ va@@ il@@ able , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was d@@ ying , but nothing changed ."
O@@ p@@ en@@ ness alone can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t had a very big fi@@ ght on her hands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic model for thinking ."
"S@@ he worked with a st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an nam@@ ed G@@ e@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ ale , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce wasn &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was a re@@ cl@@ use ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic with her patients ."
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge f@@ ran@@ kly pre@@ fer@@ red numbers to people .
But he said this f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r@@ . S@@ te@@ war@@ t wrong . &quot; &quot; He acti@@ vely s@@ ou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent ways of looking at her mo@@ d@@ els , at her st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating conf@@ lic@@ t around her the@@ or@@ ies .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that G@@ e@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the con@@ fi@@ dence she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic model of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation — thinking par@@ t@@ n@@ ers who ar@@ en &apos;t ech@@ o cha@@ m@@ bers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such coll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge were very good at conf@@ lic@@ t .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ struc@@ tive conf@@ lic@@ t requ@@ ire ?
"Well , first of all , it requ@@ i@@ res that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to re@@ si@@ st the ne@@ u@@ ro@@ bio@@ logical dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ f@@ er people m@@ os@@ tly like ourselves , and it means we have to see@@ k out people with different b@@ ack@@ gr@@ ounds , different di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to eng@@ age with them ."
That requ@@ i@@ res a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you simply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ par@@ ed to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s d@@ aughter told me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went hea@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ head with a fel@@ low scienti@@ st , they made her think and think and think again ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it stri@@ kes me that the big@@ gest problems we face , many of the big@@ gest di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers that we &apos;ve experi@@ enc@@ ed , m@@ os@@ tly ha@@ ven &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organ@@ iz@@ ations , some of them big@@ ger than countries , many of them cap@@ able of aff@@ ec@@ ting hund@@ reds , thousands , even m@@ illions of lives ."
So how do organ@@ iz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ lic@@ t .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an and American ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ ves , fully 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issu@@ es or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ ra@@ id to ra@@ ise ."
"A@@ fra@@ id of the conf@@ lic@@ t that that would pro@@ vo@@ ke , af@@ ra@@ id to get em@@ bro@@ il@@ ed in ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to l@@ ose ."
E@@ igh@@ t@@ y-@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organ@@ iz@@ ations m@@ os@@ tly can &apos;t do what G@@ e@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ antly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organ@@ iz@@ ations , and g@@ one out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , m@@ os@@ tly fa@@ il to get the best out of them ."
So how do we devel@@ op the sk@@ ill@@ s that we need ?
"Because it does take sk@@ ill and pr@@ acti@@ ce , too ."
"If we ar@@ en &apos;t going to be af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ lic@@ t , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , rec@@ ently , I worked with an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive nam@@ ed Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medi@@ cal dev@@ ice company ."
And Jo@@ e was very wor@@ ri@@ ed about the dev@@ ice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too comp@@ li@@ cated and he thought that its comple@@ x@@ ity created mar@@ gin@@ s of er@@ ro@@ r that could really h@@ ur@@ t people .
He was af@@ ra@@ id of doing da@@ ma@@ ge to the patients he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organ@@ ization , no@@ body else se@@ em@@ ed to be at all wor@@ ri@@ ed ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
Ma@@ ybe he &apos;d look stu@@ p@@ id .
"But he ke@@ pt wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ri@@ ed about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , Jo@@ e and I found a way for him to ra@@ ise his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situ@@ ation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
So now Jo@@ e had al@@ lies . They could think together .
"And y@@ es , there was a lot of conf@@ lic@@ t and de@@ b@@ ate and ar@@ gu@@ ment , but that allo@@ wed everyone around the table to be cre@@ ative , to solve the problem , and to change the dev@@ ice ."
"@@ Jo@@ e was what a lot of people might think of as a whi@@ st@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ wer , ex@@ cept that like almost all whi@@ st@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ w@@ ers , he wasn &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately dev@@ ot@@ ed to the organ@@ ization and the high@@ er pur@@ pos@@ es that that organ@@ ization ser@@ ved ."
"But he had been so af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ lic@@ t , until finally he became more af@@ ra@@ id of the si@@ l@@ ence ."
"And when he d@@ ar@@ ed to speak , he disco@@ vered much more inside hi@@ m@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever ima@@ gin@@ ed ."
And his colle@@ ag@@ ues don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
They think of him as a lead@@ er .
"So , how do we have these conver@@ sa@@ tions more ea@@ si@@ ly and more often ?"
"Well , the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity of D@@ el@@ ft requ@@ i@@ res that its P@@ h@@ D students have to sub@@ m@@ it five st@@ ate@@ ments that they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to de@@ f@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the st@@ ate@@ ments are about , what mat@@ ters is that the can@@ di@@ d@@ ates are w@@ ill@@ ing and able to st@@ and up to au@@ th@@ or@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic system , but I think lea@@ ving it to P@@ h@@ D can@@ di@@ d@@ ates is far too few people , and way too l@@ ate in life ."
"I think we need to be teach@@ ing these sk@@ ill@@ s to kids and ad@@ ul@@ ts at every st@@ age of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organ@@ iz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the big@@ gest ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve wit@@ ne@@ ssed r@@ are@@ ly come from information that is sec@@ re@@ t or hi@@ dd@@ en .
"It comes from information that is f@@ ree@@ ly a@@ va@@ il@@ able and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully bl@@ ind to , because we can &apos;t h@@ and@@ le , don &apos;t want to h@@ and@@ le , the conf@@ lic@@ t that it pro@@ vo@@ kes ."
"But when we d@@ are to brea@@ k that si@@ l@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create conf@@ lic@@ t , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ p@@ en information is f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic , open net@@ works are ess@@ ential ."
But the tru@@ th won &apos;t set us free until we devel@@ op the sk@@ ill@@ s and the ha@@ bit and the tal@@ ent and the mor@@ al cou@@ ra@@ ge to use it .
O@@ p@@ en@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the begin@@ ning .

"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I st@@ ood on the TED st@@ age in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I sp@@ o@@ ke very bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly about one of my p@@ rou@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"@@ Be@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."

"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many a@@ z@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )@@ "
There was a story I w@@ ouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll sist@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"@@ Be@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ m@@ er in a country of poor far@@ m@@ ers ."
"L@@ i@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ enc@@ ed an aw@@ ful fa@@ m@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to de@@ ath .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ m@@ a for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to pay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the h@@ un@@ ger , I was for@@ c@@ ed to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ cei@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read boo@@ ks , science boo@@ ks , esp@@ eci@@ ally phy@@ sic@@ s ."
I couldn &apos;t read Eng@@ lish that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowle@@ dge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against h@@ un@@ ger , which we were experi@@ enc@@ ing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it brea@@ ker , mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed after an electri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine pu@@ mp@@ s water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ ues of people start l@@ ining up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to blo@@ g@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , my Eng@@ lish lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afri@@ c@@ ans , and the poor who are str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with your dre@@ a@@ ms ."

"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the communi@@ st E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n G@@ er@@ many , if you o@@ w@@ ned a t@@ y@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government ."
You had to regi@@ ster a sa@@ mple sh@@ e@@ et of t@@ ext out of the t@@ y@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er .
And this was done so the government could tr@@ ack where t@@ ext was coming from .
"If they found a p@@ aper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tr@@ ack down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ c@@ t f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a col@@ or la@@ s@@ er prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or la@@ s@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and pr@@ int a p@@ age , that p@@ age will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single p@@ age in a pat@@ ter@@ n which makes the p@@ age uni@@ que to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body see@@ ms to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the ci@@ tiz@@ ens ."
And this is one of the ma@@ in three sources of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the att@@ ac@@ ks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers ."
We have three ma@@ in grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als .
"L@@ i@@ ke here , we have M@@ r@@ . D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine ."
And the m@@ oti@@ ves of on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have se@@ ver@@ al ca@@ ses of m@@ illi@@ on@@ ai@@ res on@@ line , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ t@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"Th@@ ese guys make their for@@ tun@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ le@@ g@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ g@@ g@@ ers to coll@@ ect our cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ opp@@ ing from an inf@@ ected computer ."
"The U.@@ S@@ . S@@ ec@@ re@@ t S@@ er@@ v@@ ice , two months ago , f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r@@ . S@@ am J@@ a@@ in right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S@@ . dollars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en ."
M@@ r@@ . J@@ a@@ in hi@@ m@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I cla@@ i@@ m it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more like@@ ly for any of us to become the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are wat@@ ching today are not m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated by something else — m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated by prot@@ est@@ s , m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated by an op@@ ini@@ on , m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated by the la@@ u@@ gh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ y@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or pla@@ y@@ er in the field of on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in att@@ ack@@ ers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ on@@ y@@ mous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are n@@ ation st@@ ates , govern@@ ments doing the att@@ ac@@ ks ."
And then we look at ca@@ ses like what happened in D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments att@@ ack against their own ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds — or actually , it was ."
It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were h@@ ac@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body bro@@ ke in and they h@@ ac@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ e@@ ting with D@@ ut@@ ch government re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves , I asked one of the lead@@ ers of the team whether he found pla@@ u@@ sible that people died because of the D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack ."
And his answer was y@@ es .
So how do people di@@ e as the resul@@ t of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They s@@ ell cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ t@@ es .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ t@@ es ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate if you have a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted serv@@ ices , serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors , but these serv@@ ices are esp@@ eci@@ ally pop@@ ular in t@@ ot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates like I@@ r@@ an , where dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents use fore@@ i@@ gn serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the lo@@ cal serv@@ ices and they are enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connec@@ tions , so the lo@@ cal government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions ."
E@@ x@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a fore@@ i@@ gn C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issu@@ e ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ t@@ es .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the hea@@ d@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an sec@@ re@@ t poli@@ ce in A@@ pri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of p@@ ap@@ ers ."
"A@@ m@@ ong those p@@ ap@@ ers , was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that b@@ in@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in G@@ er@@ many which had so@@ ld the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of to@@ ols for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communi@@ cation of the ci@@ tiz@@ ens of the country ."
"They had so@@ ld this too@@ l for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Eu@@ ro@@ s to the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company hea@@ d@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ est@@ er@@ n govern@@ ments are provi@@ ding t@@ ot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with to@@ ols to do this against their own ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
But W@@ est@@ er@@ n govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in G@@ er@@ many , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an used by G@@ er@@ man government off@@ ici@@ als to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate their own ci@@ tiz@@ ens ."
"If you are a su@@ sp@@ ect in a cri@@ min@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be t@@ app@@ ed ."
"But today , it goes be@@ y@@ on@@ d that ."
They will ta@@ p your Internet connec@@ tion .
"They will even use to@@ ols like St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ab@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communi@@ cation , to list@@ en to your on@@ line di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions , to coll@@ ect your pas@@ s@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ ep@@ er about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that s@@ ounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really aff@@ ect me because I &apos;m a le@@ g@@ al ci@@ tiz@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ gu@@ ment , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is imp@@ li@@ ed .
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is not up for di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion .
This is not a question between pri@@ v@@ acy against sec@@ ur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of f@@ ree@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tr@@ ust our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tr@@ ust , do we bl@@ in@@ d@@ ly tr@@ ust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e s@@ ounds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( M@@ usic ) ( Applause ) ( M@@ usic ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ ini@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stitu@@ t@@ es a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an ill@@ u@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an ill@@ u@@ sion — and actually quite a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ ound@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues see@@ m to b@@ el@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ u@@ res .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ i@@ cal ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions to@@ ward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel comp@@ as@@ sion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ ff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ s@@ ects , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ pos@@ ed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of pot@@ ential happ@@ iness and su@@ ff@@ ering ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al thing to not@@ ice here is that this is a fac@@ tual cla@@ i@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bio@@ logical comple@@ x@@ ity and the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ s@@ ects ."
"And there &apos;s no n@@ oti@@ on , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible chan@@ ges ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from reli@@ gi@@ on , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely re@@ l@@ ate to condi@@ tions after de@@ ath — either to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of happ@@ iness with G@@ od or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of su@@ ff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its chan@@ ges ."
"And to say that such chan@@ ges can per@@ si@@ st after de@@ ath is itself a fac@@ tual cla@@ i@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the condi@@ tions of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ il@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the b@@ as@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ di@@ scri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a conf@@ er@@ ence like this is even con@@ cei@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately b@@ la@@ me their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human communi@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality re@@ l@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our situ@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many le@@ vel@@ s — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of econom@@ ic systems and political ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — wh@@ ate@@ ver happens after de@@ ath .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his pers@@ on@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate pers@@ on@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture chan@@ ges us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it chan@@ ges us by chan@@ ging our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore wh@@ ate@@ ver cul@@ tur@@ al vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ext of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vi@@ su@@ al@@ ize a space of possible chan@@ ges in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape , with pe@@ a@@ ks and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , both pers@@ onal and coll@@ ective ."
"And one thing to not@@ ice is that perhaps there are st@@ ates of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we r@@ are@@ ly ac@@ cess , that few people ac@@ cess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these st@@ ates can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ sti@@ cal or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other st@@ ates that we can &apos;t ac@@ cess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds pos@@ si@@ bly could ac@@ cess them .
"Now , let me be cle@@ ar about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ cei@@ v@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for inst@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ r@@ an &apos;s n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar fac@@ i@@ li@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business exp@@ en@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions aff@@ ect human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this — just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how humans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For inst@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 st@@ ates in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the cla@@ ss@@ room is le@@ g@@ al , where it is le@@ g@@ al for a te@@ ac@@ her to be@@ at a child with a w@@ oo@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ is@@ es and bli@@ st@@ ers and even brea@@ king the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ reds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ j@@ ected to this every year ."
"The lo@@ ca@@ tions of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ ale for this behavi@@ or is exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly reli@@ gi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ ator of the universe hi@@ m@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , le@@ st we sp@@ o@@ il the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spea@@ king , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and viol@@ ence and public hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation as a way of enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ging heal@@ thy emoti@@ onal develop@@ ment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the n@@ oti@@ on of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ defin@@ ed , and see@@ min@@ g@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ j@@ ective n@@ oti@@ on of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by anal@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physi@@ cal health ."
The con@@ cept of physi@@ cal health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this st@@ at@@ ue was car@@ ved the a@@ verage life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develop@@ ed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
People will s@@ end you d@@ on@@ ations when you &apos;re in that condi@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vi@@ sion , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as cle@@ ar and con@@ sequ@@ ential as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to not@@ ice is there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the mor@@ al l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing .
"Now , why w@@ ouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an ob@@ j@@ ective mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be te@@ mp@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ stitu@@ te heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a cle@@ ar dist@@ inc@@ tion between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not te@@ mp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univer@@ s@@ al mor@@ ality would requ@@ ire mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for inst@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by anal@@ o@@ gy , the ga@@ me of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en is a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a dom@@ a@@ in of per@@ f@@ ect ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the pos@@ ition , gener@@ ally spea@@ king , of our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the p@@ rou@@ d den@@ iz@@ ens of an anci@@ ent culture are wrong to for@@ ce their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h ba@@ gs ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el ca@@ ble , or th@@ row b@@ at@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ t@@ end that we know so little about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we have to be non@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pr@@ acti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary w@@ ear@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to w@@ ear wh@@ ate@@ ver they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a community where , when a gir@@ l gets r@@ ap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first imp@@ ul@@ se , rather often , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of sha@@ me ?"
"@@ J@@ ust let that fact de@@ t@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a min@@ u@@ te : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets r@@ ap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ a@@ k of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ f@@ ect solu@@ tion in our own society ."
"For inst@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may requ@@ ire a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ective m@@ ood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ f@@ ect ex@@ pres@@ sion of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical b@@ al@@ ance with resp@@ ect to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ outh and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tr@@ um between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better b@@ al@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other chan@@ ges in human culture there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the mor@@ al l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape ."
But the thing to not@@ ice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ a@@ k .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who see@@ m to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions are reli@@ gi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an int@@ elli@@ g@@ ent anal@@ y@@ s@@ is of the ca@@ uses and condi@@ tion of human and an@@ ima@@ l w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the end@@ ur@@ ance of reli@@ gi@@ on as a l@@ ens through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ par@@ ated most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and an@@ ima@@ l su@@ ff@@ ering ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ sequ@@ ential issu@@ e .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a univer@@ s@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to not@@ ice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — esp@@ eci@@ ally sec@@ ular , a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic , scienti@@ st typ@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differ@@ ences of op@@ ini@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for inst@@ ance the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ d@@ it@@ ating on comp@@ as@@ sion , and he thin@@ ks that help@@ ing other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gr@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent of human happ@@ iness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and r@@ ap@@ ing and t@@ ort@@ uring and kill@@ ing young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ ini@@ on about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ est@@ er@@ n int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ als look at this situ@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real ar@@ gu@@ ment that pot@@ enti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He li@@ kes cho@@ col@@ ate , he li@@ kes v@@ an@@ ill@@ a ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot@@ ice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ ori@@ st .
"If you ask the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ sts around who is the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a phy@@ sic@@ s conf@@ er@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing the@@ ory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ s@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ ci@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing the@@ ory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of str@@ ing the@@ ory .
( Laughter ) I w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to b@@ el@@ ong to any str@@ ing the@@ ory clu@@ b that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ ini@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a dom@@ a@@ in of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for knowle@@ dge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al exper@@ ti@@ se , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ ini@@ on has to coun@@ t ? How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on phy@@ sic@@ s that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing , and mor@@ ality re@@ l@@ ates to that dom@@ a@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have belie@@ f@@ s and desi@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to nee@@ d@@ less human su@@ ff@@ ering ."
J@@ ust ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this will trans@@ form our di@@ sc@@ our@@ se about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world f@@ ill@@ ed with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ en@@ ted ; it will always be ea@@ si@@ er to brea@@ k things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It see@@ ms to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently obvi@@ ous that we can no more resp@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate va@@ st differ@@ ences in n@@ oti@@ ons of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being than we can resp@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate va@@ st differ@@ ences in the n@@ oti@@ ons about how disease sp@@ rea@@ ds , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of buil@@ d@@ ings and a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must conver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble materi@@ al there ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther in this au@@ di@@ ence or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age see@@ ms to be really important here .

They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tion of fe@@ m@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cated p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical view — &quot; that m@@ ale l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ sted . &quot;"
"I mean , can you eng@@ age in a conver@@ sa@@ tion with that kind of woman without se@@ em@@ ing kind of cul@@ tur@@ al im@@ per@@ i@@ ali@@ st ?"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ r@@ is : Y@@ eah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a s@@ ent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ lo@@ ck tic@@ king , but the question is : What is v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a cont@@ ext where men have certain exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to w@@ ear a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or t@@ at@@ too their face — I think we should be free to v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly do wh@@ ate@@ ver we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so ea@@ ger to always take their word for it , esp@@ eci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one di@@ men@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ int your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ lo@@ ck 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , b@@ al@@ anc@@ ing mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the p@@ ath to@@ ward underst@@ anding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ ta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the pos@@ i@@ tive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ ali@@ ties of ourselves in much gre@@ ater de@@ ta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand pos@@ i@@ tive social emoti@@ on like emp@@ a@@ thy and comp@@ as@@ sion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re econom@@ ic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to conver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gr@@ ab@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my d@@ aughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and w@@ ell@@ -@@ edu@@ cated in the cont@@ ext of men who do desi@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ olved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
D@@ o people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the resul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your inst@@ inc@@ tive curr@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well y@@ eah , mo@@ d@@ ul@@ o one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ext of a tru@@ ly d@@ el@@ usi@@ onal belie@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I ch@@ opp@@ ed his head off . And that was the most comp@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts ali@@ gn@@ ed , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the emoti@@ on of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in a lar@@ ger cont@@ ext ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ st@@ asy and then blo@@ wing hi@@ m@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a conver@@ sa@@ tion I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an hon@@ or . Thank you .
( Applause )
"Th@@ ank you so much everyone from TED , and Ch@@ r@@ is and A@@ my in particular ."
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not s@@ le@@ pt in weeks .
"N@@ e@@ il and I were sit@@ ting there com@@ par@@ ing how little we &apos;ve s@@ le@@ pt in an@@ tici@@ p@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so ner@@ v@@ ous — and I do this when I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organ@@ ization called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might jo@@ in in and do si@@ mil@@ ar things ."
"B@@ ack in about 2@@ 000 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ ish my first book , I was w@@ and@@ ering around da@@ z@@ ed every day because I wr@@ ote from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
"I had no mental ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood that I li@@ ved in , P@@ ark S@@ lo@@ p@@ e , there are a lot of wr@@ it@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per cap@@ it@@ a ra@@ ti@@ o of wr@@ it@@ ers to nor@@ mal people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of teach@@ ers ."
"M@@ y mo@@ m was a te@@ ac@@ her , my si@@ ster became a te@@ ac@@ her and after colle@@ ge so many of my friends went into teach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always hear@@ ing them talk about their lives and how insp@@ ir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and con@@ st@@ antly insp@@ ir@@ ing people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the str@@ ug@@ g@@ les they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teach@@ ing in city sch@@ o@@ ols were having tr@@ ou@@ ble with their students ke@@ ep@@ ing up at gra@@ de level , in their read@@ ing and wr@@ iting in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds where Eng@@ lish isn &apos;t sp@@ o@@ ken in the home , where a lot of them have different speci@@ al needs , learning dis@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties . And of course they &apos;re working in sch@@ o@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fund@@ ed ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bo@@ dies , more on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , more hours , more exper@@ ti@@ se from people that have sk@@ ill@@ s in Eng@@ lish and can work with these students on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five cla@@ ss@@ es of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day ."
How can we pos@@ si@@ bly give each stud@@ ent even one h@@ our a week of on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly the wor@@ k@@ week and cl@@ one the teach@@ ers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this ma@@ ssi@@ ve group of people I knew : wr@@ it@@ ers , ed@@ it@@ ors , jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts , gra@@ du@@ ate students , as@@ sist@@ ant prof@@ ess@@ ors , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble da@@ i@@ ly hours and an inter@@ est in the Eng@@ lish word — I hope to have an inter@@ est in the Eng@@ lish language , but I &apos;m not spea@@ king it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That c@@ lo@@ ck has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an inter@@ est in the pri@@ m@@ acy of the wr@@ it@@ ten word in terms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a demo@@ cr@@ acy , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two communi@@ ties together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , we r@@ en@@ ted this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we publi@@ shed tw@@ ice or three times a year , and a few other ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines — we were going to move it into an off@@ ice for the first time ."
It used to be in my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an off@@ ice , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these wr@@ it@@ ers and ed@@ it@@ ors and everybody — sort of a wr@@ iting community — coming into the off@@ ice every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get ex@@ tr@@ a help on their wr@@ it@@ ten h@@ ome@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two communi@@ ties ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on wh@@ ate@@ ver we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or wh@@ ate@@ ver it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
"So , we had this place , we r@@ en@@ ted it , the l@@ and@@ l@@ ord was all for it . We did this m@@ ural , that &apos;s a Ch@@ r@@ is W@@ are m@@ ural , that basically expla@@ ins the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in m@@ ural form — it takes a long time to di@@ gest and you have to st@@ and in the middle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we r@@ en@@ ted this space .
"And everything was great ex@@ cept the l@@ and@@ l@@ ord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is z@@ on@@ ed for re@@ ta@@ il ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ t@@ a s@@ ell something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a h@@ a ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly to s@@ ell , but we did all the nec@@ ess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a we@@ ight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors b@@ el@@ ow , ac@@ ou@@ stic ti@@ le ce@@ il@@ ings and flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent li@@ ghts ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful w@@ oo@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ wa@@ shed be@@ a@@ ms and it had the look — while we were r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the h@@ ul@@ l of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should s@@ ell supp@@ lies to the working b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody la@@ u@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s s@@ ell p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ lies . &quot; &quot; This is the p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore .
"You see , this is sort of a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch I did on a n@@ ap@@ k@@ in ."
"A great car@@ p@@ en@@ ter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of p@@ ir@@ ate su@@ p@@ pl@@ y-@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks so@@ ld by the f@@ oo@@ t and we have supp@@ lies to com@@ b@@ at sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all h@@ and@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you ."
"@@ U@@ p at the top , you see the ey@@ ep@@ at@@ ch di@@ sp@@ l@@ ay , which is the black col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your ey@@ ep@@ at@@ ch , and then you have the pa@@ ste@@ l and other col@@ ors for ste@@ pp@@ ing out at night — speci@@ al oc@@ ca@@ sions , b@@ ar m@@ it@@ z@@ va@@ h@@ s and wh@@ ate@@ ver ."
So we op@@ en@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ as@@ u@@ res that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ e@@ ment eyes in case you l@@ ose one .
These are some sign@@ s that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ r@@ ac@@ tical Jo@@ king with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re read@@ ing the si@@ gn , we pul@@ l a rop@@ e behind the coun@@ ter and e@@ ight mo@@ p hea@@ ds dro@@ p on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s hea@@ ds .
"It became mo@@ p hea@@ ds . And this is the fish the@@ ater , which is just a s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater t@@ ank with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So right there is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s off@@ ices , where all of us would be working on the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine and book ed@@ iting and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we op@@ en@@ ed up , we spent months and months r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place ."
"We had t@@ ab@@ les , cha@@ ir@@ s , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ co@@ m a@@ uc@@ tion at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and I b@@ ou@@ ght 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a st@@ ro@@ ke of a p@@ ad@@ d@@ le .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we b@@ ou@@ ght &apos; e@@ m , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were wr@@ it@@ ers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich bo@@ ard out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ ut@@ or@@ ing for Y@@ our Eng@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ r@@ it@@ ing@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated N@@ e@@ e@@ ds — J@@ ust C@@ ome In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re g@@ on@@ n@@ a love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we wa@@ ited , we s@@ at at the t@@ ab@@ les , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited ."
"And everybody was be@@ coming very di@@ sc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged because it was weeks and weeks that we wa@@ ited , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tr@@ ust ga@@ p , because we were oper@@ ating behind a p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed a woman nam@@ ed N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ ali@@ gar@@ i , a lon@@ g@@ time S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o edu@@ ca@@ tor — she was teach@@ ing in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experience nec@@ ess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was connec@@ ted with all the teach@@ ers and community mem@@ bers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood — I conv@@ inc@@ ed her to move up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was teach@@ ing ."
She took over as ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive direc@@ tor .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ ro@@ a@@ ds with the teach@@ ers and the parents and the students and everything , and so su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to off@@ er every day was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one ra@@ ti@@ o with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , a stud@@ ent can get one gra@@ de level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , Eng@@ lish is not sp@@ o@@ ken in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey a@@ uc@@ tion right there — the parents will sometimes wat@@ ch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the b@@ as@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et within those few blo@@ cks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big b@@ ack@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or wh@@ ate@@ ver , actually run@@ ning to this space , which is very str@@ an@@ ge , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no sti@@ g@@ m@@ a ."
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds wer@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ en@@ ter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s@@ -@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ N@@ e@@ ed@@ -@@ M@@ o@@ re@@ -@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was a p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore , which is in@@ s@@ an@@ e ."
"And then secon@@ d@@ ly , there &apos;s a publi@@ shing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same t@@ ab@@ les very often , and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ nex@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter — publi@@ shing cen@@ ter , is what we called it — and a wr@@ iting cen@@ ter ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school stud@@ ent actually working on a no@@ vel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no sti@@ g@@ m@@ a .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ ative en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing ad@@ ul@@ ts . They &apos;re mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing their behavi@@ or .
"Th@@ ese ad@@ ul@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their field ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these ad@@ ul@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ e@@ ds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ pol@@ l@@ in@@ ation . The only problem , esp@@ eci@@ ally for the ad@@ ul@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly b@@ ou@@ ght into all of this when they sign@@ ed up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) W@@ ith like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ i@@ shing their h@@ ome@@ work in a given day , working on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one , getting all this atten@@ tion — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their h@@ ome@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re allo@@ wed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their family , en@@ jo@@ y other h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A b@@ unch of happy fami@@ lies in a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is a happy community .
A b@@ unch of happy communi@@ ties ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is h@@ ome@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
"So we started off with about 12 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hund@@ red ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our ros@@ ter ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly easy to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , next to one stud@@ ent , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated atten@@ tion , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thou@@ ghts and their self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , is going to be ab@@ solu@@ tely trans@@ forma@@ tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps gre@@ w so fa@@ st ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started br@@ ing@@ ing in cla@@ ss@@ es during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a field tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being typ@@ ed up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
This is one of the cla@@ ss@@ es getting way too exc@@ ited about wr@@ iting .
"You just point a camer@@ a at a cla@@ ss , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the boo@@ ks that they do .
"N@@ ot@@ ice the ti@@ tle of the book , &quot; The B@@ oo@@ k That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book nam@@ ed C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ while , there &apos;s an ad@@ ult in the back typ@@ ing this up , taking it completely ser@@ i@@ ously , which blo@@ ws their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a sho@@ t of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The teach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to teach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , completely mal@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The teach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most u@@ se@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the sch@@ o@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that w@@ ouldn &apos;t come to you , nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive parents that are br@@ ing@@ ing them in , or ar@@ en &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor ros@@ ter ."
"@@ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A te@@ ac@@ her will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ und@@ a@@ ys ."
"We &apos;re working on our colle@@ ge es@@ says . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the w@@ ire : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ tors ."
Wh@@ o@@ ever can make it sign@@ s up . They go in about a half an h@@ our before the cla@@ ss .
"The te@@ ac@@ her t@@ ells them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ ining is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s gu@@ i@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the br@@ un@@ t of what we do is , people going stra@@ ight from their wor@@ k@@ place , stra@@ ight from home , stra@@ ight into the cla@@ ss@@ room and working direc@@ tly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a cla@@ ss@@ room and you can st@@ af@@ f it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ et@@ t M@@ i@@ ddle S@@ ch@@ ool W@@ r@@ it@@ ers &apos; R@@ oo@@ m , where we dec@@ or@@ ated it in b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ br@@ ary . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this middle school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ igh@@ t-@@ U@@ p N@@ e@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from Ma@@ y@@ or G@@ a@@ v@@ in N@@ e@@ w@@ so@@ m in both langu@@ ages — Eng@@ lish and S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"So then one day I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ l@@ en@@ de wr@@ ote to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ si@@ gn a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to wr@@ ite about how to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve pe@@ ace in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ sh@@ all H@@ i@@ gh S@@ ch@@ ool , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sign@@ ment to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ l@@ en@@ de is going to read all your es@@ says at the end ."
She &apos;s going to publi@@ sh them in a book .
She &apos;s going to sp@@ on@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in p@@ ap@@ er@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be a@@ va@@ il@@ able in all the boo@@ k@@ st@@ o@@ res in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and throu@@ gh@@ out the world , on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside au@@ di@@ ence , there was I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ l@@ en@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a ser@@ ies of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an sp@@ on@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I M@@ ight G@@ et S@@ ome@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an on@@ going thing . M@@ ore and more boo@@ ks .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ dic@@ ted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can di@@ min@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ o@@ red their words , hon@@ o@@ red their thou@@ ghts with hund@@ reds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this atten@@ tion that we give to their thou@@ ghts ."
"And once they ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve that level , once they &apos;ve wr@@ it@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s ab@@ solu@@ tely trans@@ forma@@ tive .
And so then they &apos;re all so@@ ld in the st@@ ore . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We s@@ ell all the stud@@ ent boo@@ ks .
"Wh@@ ere else would you put them , right ?"
"So we s@@ ell &apos; e@@ m , and then something we@@ ird had been happening with the st@@ o@@ res . The st@@ ore , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the st@@ ore actually made money ."
So it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ dge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the p@@ ir@@ ate mo@@ vi@@ es and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent , pa@@ ying a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time st@@ af@@ f member there ."
There &apos;s the oce@@ an m@@ aps you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ ate@@ way to the community .
"@@ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ w@@ ear on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ y@@ on@@ d — there &apos;s u@@ su@@ ally a little cha@@ in there — right be@@ y@@ on@@ d , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a field tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ opp@@ ing , and they might be more like@@ ly to bu@@ y some l@@ ard , or mil@@ let for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a h@@ oo@@ k , or h@@ oo@@ k prot@@ ec@@ tor for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we s@@ ell ."
So the st@@ ore actually did really well .
"But it b@@ rought in so many people — teach@@ ers , d@@ on@@ ors , v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a non@@ -@@ prof@@ it bu@@ ri@@ ed , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . It was right in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of we@@ ird , happy ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been form@@ er edu@@ ca@@ tors or w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be edu@@ ca@@ tors , so they com@@ b@@ ined with a lot of lo@@ cal design@@ ers , lo@@ cal wr@@ it@@ ers , and they just took the idea in@@ dep@@ end@@ ently and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to s@@ ell p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ lies .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ wing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting community in New York , they op@@ en@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n S@@ u@@ per@@ her@@ o S@@ u@@ pp@@ ly C@@ om@@ p@@ any ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ sm@@ ith &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every serv@@ ice they &apos;ve ever off@@ ered , you know , all over there ."
"So they op@@ en@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ os@@ t@@ c@@ o for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the supp@@ lies in kind of ba@@ si@@ c form ."
These are all h@@ and@@ made .
"Th@@ ese are all sort of re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ed other produc@@ ts , or wh@@ ate@@ ver ."
All the p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ing is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the v@@ il@@ la@@ in con@@ tain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the off@@ ice ."
"This is a little va@@ ult — you have to put your produc@@ t in there , it goes up an electri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter t@@ ells you that you have to rec@@ ite the v@@ ow of her@@ o@@ ism , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y anything . And it lim@@ its , really , their s@@ al@@ es ."
"P@@ er@@ s@@ on@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produc@@ ts . These are all h@@ and@@ made .
This is a sec@@ re@@ t identi@@ ty k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the identi@@ ty of S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one , one American fe@@ m@@ ale mar@@ ke@@ ting ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive from H@@ o@@ bo@@ ken , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full d@@ os@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one ."
"So , this is the cap@@ ery where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded ste@@ ps and then we turn on three hy@@ dra@@ u@@ li@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is b@@ un@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly op@@ ens ."
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grap@@ pl@@ ing h@@ oo@@ ks .
It op@@ ens and then this is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full eff@@ ect !
"But this is — I just want to emp@@ ha@@ size — lo@@ c@@ ally fund@@ ed , lo@@ c@@ ally built ."
"A@@ ll the design@@ ers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was lo@@ cal , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ on@@ o ."
"I just came and vi@@ s@@ ited and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or wh@@ ate@@ ver . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bus@@ y . S@@ a@@ me prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es : on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , comple@@ te dev@@ oti@@ on to the students &apos; work and a b@@ ound@@ less op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and sort of a pos@@ si@@ bility of cre@@ ati@@ vity and ideas ."
"And this s@@ wit@@ ch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their hea@@ ds when they walk through those 1@@ 8 fe@@ et of this bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re st@@ ore , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der on t@@ ab@@ les , p@@ enc@@ il@@ s and p@@ ap@@ ers , wh@@ ate@@ ver ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."
You can read this quot@@ e .
A@@ d@@ dic@@ ted to video g@@ am@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ouldn &apos;t con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate at home .
C@@ a@@ me in . G@@ ot this con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated atten@@ tion .
And he couldn &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was wr@@ iting . He would fin@@ ish his h@@ ome@@ work early — got really ad@@ dic@@ ted to fin@@ i@@ shing his h@@ ome@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it ch@@ ec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve the next thing and be pre@@ par@@ ed for school the next day ."
"So he got h@@ oo@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been publi@@ shed in five boo@@ ks .
"He co@@ -@@ wr@@ ote a mo@@ ck@@ um@@ ent@@ ary about fa@@ il@@ ed super@@ her@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; S@@ u@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ Be@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wr@@ ote a ser@@ ies on &quot; &quot; P@@ en@@ gu@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fi@@ gh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — p@@ en@@ gu@@ in ."
"And then he read al@@ ou@@ d just a few weeks ago to 5@@ 00 people at S@@ y@@ mp@@ hon@@ y S@@ p@@ ace , at a b@@ ene@@ f@@ it for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ an@@ ge@@ li@@ cal about it . He br@@ ings his cou@@ s@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four family mem@@ bers that come in every day .
"So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly ."
"This is L@@ .@@ A@@ . , The E@@ ch@@ o P@@ ark T@@ i@@ me T@@ ra@@ vel M@@ art : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever You A@@ re , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Th@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven for time tra@@ vel@@ ers ."
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
L@@ e@@ ech@@ es . M@@ am@@ m@@ ot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ l@@ ur@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of O@@ r@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ack Y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An@@ y@@ way . So I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p a@@ head .
"Th@@ ese are sp@@ ac@@ es that are only aff@@ i@@ li@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : W@@ ord St@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ field , M@@ as@@ s@@ ac@@ hu@@ se@@ t@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ po@@ t in C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i ; Y@@ outh S@@ pe@@ a@@ ks , S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , which insp@@ i@@ red us ; S@@ tu@@ di@@ o St@@ .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that o@@ kay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a min@@ u@@ te . So , the TED W@@ ish : I w@@ ish that you — you pers@@ on@@ ally and every cre@@ ative individu@@ al and organ@@ ization you know — will find a way to direc@@ tly eng@@ age with a public school in your are@@ a and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got inv@@ olved , so that within a year we have a thous@@ and exa@@ mp@@ les — a thous@@ and ! — of trans@@ forma@@ tive par@@ t@@ ner@@ shi@@ ps ."
P@@ ro@@ found le@@ aps for@@ ward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and insp@@ ire others on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
We created a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite .
"I &apos;m going to s@@ wit@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the atten@@ de@@ es of this conf@@ er@@ ence will u@@ sh@@ er in a new er@@ a of par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation in our public sch@@ o@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the le@@ ad in par@@ t@@ n@@ ering your inno@@ v@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it and exper@@ ti@@ se with that of inno@@ v@@ ative edu@@ ca@@ tors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be u@@ se@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll ste@@ p in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your lo@@ cal school and con@@ sul@@ t with the teach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , they did this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job ."
"This we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is already up , it &apos;s already got a b@@ unch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ p@@ on a S@@ ch@@ ool , &quot; &quot; which is a great ti@@ tle , I think ."
"This s@@ ite will do@@ cu@@ ment every story , every project that comes out of this conf@@ er@@ ence and around the world . So you go to the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , you see a b@@ unch of ideas you can be insp@@ i@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own pro@@ jects once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ ad@@ line . So , vi@@ s@@ it the s@@ ite ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our direc@@ tor of national progra@@ ms . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You e@@ ma@@ il him , he &apos;ll answer any question you pos@@ si@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you insp@@ i@@ red and get you going and gu@@ i@@ de you through the process so that you can aff@@ ect change .
And it can be fu@@ n ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be st@@ eri@@ le . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bu@@ rea@@ uc@@ ra@@ tic@@ ally un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the sk@@ ill@@ s that you have .
The sch@@ o@@ ols need you . The teach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents and parents need you . They need your ac@@ tual person : your physi@@ cal pers@@ on@@ h@@ ood and your open min@@ ds and open ear@@ s and b@@ ound@@ less comp@@ as@@ sion , sit@@ ting next to them , list@@ ening and no@@ d@@ ding and as@@ king questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pla@@ in know how good they are : how smar@@ t and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
"So , imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this blo@@ ck ? &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , well , this is O@@ a@@ k S@@ tre@@ et , that &apos;s E@@ l@@ m S@@ tre@@ et ."
"This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of that blo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blo@@ cks don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."
"S@@ tre@@ ets have nam@@ es ; blo@@ cks are just the un@@ nam@@ ed sp@@ ac@@ es in between st@@ ree@@ ts . &quot; &quot; He lea@@ ves , a little conf@@ used and dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted ."
"So , now imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in J@@ ap@@ an , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , well that &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , st@@ ree@@ ts don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."
B@@ lo@@ cks have nam@@ es .
"@@ J@@ ust look at Goo@@ gle M@@ aps here . There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 14 , 15 , 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 ."
"A@@ ll of these blo@@ cks have nam@@ es , and the st@@ ree@@ ts are just the un@@ nam@@ ed sp@@ ac@@ es in between the blo@@ cks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ i@@ stri@@ c@@ t E@@ ight ."
"There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but wal@@ king around the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood , I not@@ ic@@ ed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first house ever built on a blo@@ ck is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to real@@ ize as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and real@@ ize that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you pay them , and when you &apos;re si@@ ck you don &apos;t have to pay them because they fa@@ il@@ ed at their job . They get ri@@ ch when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not si@@ ck ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the begin@@ ning of the m@@ usi@@ cal ph@@ ra@@ se : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est Afri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ ra@@ se , like the per@@ i@@ od at the end of a s@@ ent@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ ra@@ sing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this ma@@ p is also ac@@ cur@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that wh@@ ate@@ ver true thing you can say about In@@ dia , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."
"So , let &apos;s never for@@ get , whether at TED , or any@@ where else , that wh@@ ate@@ ver bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant ideas you have or hear , that the op@@ pos@@ ite may also be true ."
D@@ om@@ o ari@@ ga@@ to go@@ z@@ a@@ ima@@ sh@@ it@@ a .
"So I started working with re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es because I wanted to make a difference , and making a difference star@@ ts with telling their stories ."
"So when I me@@ et re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , I always ask them questions ."
Wh@@ o b@@ om@@ bed your house ?
Wh@@ o kill@@ ed your son ?
D@@ id the rest of your family make it out ali@@ ve ?
How are you cop@@ ing in your life in ex@@ i@@ le ?
"But there &apos;s one question that always see@@ ms to me to be most re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing , and that is : What did you take ?"
"What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the b@@ om@@ b@@ s were exp@@ lo@@ ding in your to@@ wn , and the ar@@ med g@@ an@@ gs were appro@@ ach@@ ing your house ?"
A S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e bo@@ y I know told me that he didn &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent d@@ an@@ ger .
"He took his high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a , and later he told me why ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a because my life dep@@ en@@ ded on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"O@@ n his way to school , he would do@@ dge s@@ ni@@ per@@ s ."
"H@@ is cla@@ ss@@ room sometimes sh@@ oo@@ k with the sound of b@@ om@@ b@@ s and sh@@ elling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day , I would say to him every mor@@ ning , &apos; H@@ on@@ ey , p@@ lease don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he in@@ sist@@ ed , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;"
"But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all af@@ ra@@ id , but our de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to gra@@ du@@ ate is str@@ on@@ ger than our f@@ ear . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got ter@@ ri@@ ble news ."
"H@@ any &apos;s a@@ un@@ t , his un@@ cle and his cou@@ s@@ in were m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in their h@@ om@@ es for re@@ f@@ using to leave their house ."
Th@@ e@@ ir th@@ ro@@ ats were sli@@ t .
It was time to f@@ le@@ e .
"They left that day , right away , in their car , H@@ any hi@@ dd@@ en in the back because they were fac@@ ing ch@@ ec@@ k@@ po@@ in@@ ts of men@@ ac@@ ing sol@@ di@@ ers ."
"And they would c@@ ross the bor@@ der into L@@ e@@ ban@@ on , where they would find pe@@ ace ."
But they would beg@@ in a life of gr@@ u@@ el@@ ing har@@ d@@ ship and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y .
"They had no cho@@ ice but to build a sh@@ ack on the side of a mu@@ d@@ dy field , and this is H@@ any &apos;s bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f , who pla@@ ys outside ."
"And that day , they jo@@ ined the big@@ gest population of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in the world , in a country , L@@ e@@ ban@@ on , that is tin@@ y ."
"It only has four million ci@@ tiz@@ ens , and there are one million S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es living there ."
"There &apos;s not a to@@ wn , a city or a v@@ il@@ la@@ ge that is not h@@ ost to S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
This is gener@@ os@@ ity and human@@ ity that is re@@ mark@@ able .
"Th@@ ink about it this way , pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately ."
"It would be as if the entire population of G@@ er@@ many , 80 million people , would f@@ le@@ e to the United States in just three years ."
"H@@ al@@ f of the entire population of S@@ y@@ ri@@ a is now u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed , most of them inside the country ."
S@@ i@@ x and a half million people have fl@@ ed for their lives .
"O@@ ver and well over three million people have c@@ ros@@ sed the bor@@ ders and have found s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing countries , and only a small pro@@ por@@ tion , as you see , have mo@@ ved on to Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
What I find most wor@@ r@@ ying is that half of all S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are children .
I took this picture of this little gir@@ l .
It was just two hours after she had ar@@ ri@@ ved after a long tre@@ k from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a into J@@ or@@ d@@ an .
And most tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ing of all is that only 20 percent of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children are in school in L@@ e@@ ban@@ on .
"And yet , S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , all re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , as cen@@ ters of exc@@ ell@@ ence , where re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es can tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h over their tra@@ um@@ a and tra@@ in for the day that they can go home as ag@@ ents of pos@@ i@@ tive change and social trans@@ formation ."
"It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of the ter@@ ri@@ ble war in S@@ om@@ ali@@ a that has been ra@@ ging on for 2@@ 2 years ."
And imagine living in this ca@@ m@@ p .
I vi@@ s@@ ited this ca@@ m@@ p .
"It &apos;s in D@@ j@@ i@@ b@@ out@@ i , ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing S@@ om@@ ali@@ a , and it was so re@@ m@@ ote that we had to take a he@@ li@@ cop@@ ter to f@@ ly there ."
It was du@@ st@@ y and it was ter@@ ri@@ bly h@@ ot .
"And we went to vi@@ s@@ it a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this gir@@ l across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own d@@ aughter , and I went up and tal@@ ked to her ."
"M@@ y sch@@ o@@ ol@@ ing days are over . &quot; &quot; And I thought , there must be some mis@@ underst@@ anding , so I turned to my colle@@ ag@@ ue and she con@@ fir@@ med to me there is no fund@@ ing for secon@@ d@@ ary education in this ca@@ m@@ p ."
"@@ Be@@ li@@ e@@ ve me or not , I come off@@ ering a solu@@ tion to a very important part of this lar@@ ger problem , with the requ@@ is@@ ite foc@@ us on climate ."
"And the solu@@ tion I off@@ er is to the big@@ gest cul@@ pr@@ it in this ma@@ ssi@@ ve mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of the ear@@ th by human@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting dec@@ line of the bi@@ osp@@ here ."
"That cul@@ pr@@ it is business and indu@@ stry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 5@@ 2 years since my gra@@ du@@ ation from G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a T@@ ec@@ h in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"As an indu@@ stri@@ al engine@@ er , cu@@ m as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing and then suc@@ cess@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur ."
"A@@ f@@ ter f@@ oun@@ ding my company , Inter@@ face , from sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 3@@ 6 years ago , to pro@@ duce car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ les in America for the business and in@@ stitu@@ tion mar@@ ke@@ ts , and sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and survi@@ v@@ al to pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity and global dom@@ in@@ ance in its field , I read P@@ au@@ l H@@ aw@@ ken &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ co@@ logy of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the su@@ mm@@ er of 199@@ 4 ."
"In his book , P@@ au@@ l char@@ ges business and indu@@ stry as , one , the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it in ca@@ using the dec@@ line of the bi@@ osp@@ here , and , two , the only in@@ stitu@@ tion that is large enough , and per@@ va@@ sive enough , and powerful enough , to really le@@ ad human@@ kind out of this m@@ ess ."
And by the way he conv@@ ic@@ ted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the ear@@ th .
"And I then challen@@ ged the people of Inter@@ face , my company , to le@@ ad our company and the entire indu@@ stri@@ al world to su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , which we defin@@ ed as ev@@ en@@ tually oper@@ ating our pe@@ t@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company in such a way as to take from the ear@@ th only what can be r@@ ene@@ wed by the ear@@ th , nat@@ ur@@ ally and r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly — not another f@@ re@@ sh dro@@ p of o@@ il — and to do no har@@ m to the bi@@ osp@@ here ."
T@@ a@@ ke nothing : do no har@@ m .
"I simply said , &quot; &quot; If H@@ aw@@ ken is right and business and indu@@ stry must le@@ ad , who will le@@ ad business and indu@@ stry ?"
"@@ Un@@ less somebody lea@@ ds , no@@ body will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a@@ x@@ i@@ om@@ ati@@ c . Why not us ?"
"And th@@ an@@ ks to the people of Inter@@ face , I have become a reco@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ ort@@ un@@ e M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine wr@@ it@@ er that some@@ day people like me would go to j@@ a@@ il .
And that became the hea@@ d@@ line of a F@@ ort@@ un@@ e ar@@ tic@@ le .
They went on to descri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ rom pl@@ under@@ er to reco@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , f@@ ran@@ kly , was a pretty sa@@ d comm@@ ent@@ ary on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."
"A@@ s@@ ked later in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary , &quot; &quot; The C@@ or@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I me@@ ant by the &quot; &quot; go to j@@ a@@ il &quot; &quot; re@@ mar@@ k , I off@@ ered that the@@ ft is a cri@@ me ."
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cri@@ me .
"But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cri@@ me — there must be a cle@@ ar , de@@ mon@@ str@@ able al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative to the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ ma@@ ke@@ -@@ wa@@ st@@ e indu@@ stri@@ al system that so dom@@ in@@ ates our ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , and is the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by di@@ g@@ ging up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to produc@@ ts that quickly become wa@@ st@@ e in a l@@ and@@ f@@ ill or an inc@@ in@@ er@@ ator — in sh@@ ort , di@@ g@@ ging up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to pol@@ l@@ u@@ tion ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a w@@ ell@@ -@@ known environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation , imp@@ act — a bad thing — is the produc@@ t of population , aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , imp@@ act is gener@@ ated by people , what they con@@ su@@ me in their aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence , and how it is produc@@ ed ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is lar@@ ge@@ ly sub@@ j@@ ective , you can perhaps qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y people , and perhaps qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ usi@@ ve in too many ways to qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y ."
So the equ@@ ation is con@@ cep@@ tual .
S@@ ti@@ ll it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ pe@@ t , a pe@@ t@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive produc@@ t for materi@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our techno@@ logi@@ es so they di@@ min@@ i@@ shed environ@@ mental imp@@ act , rather than mul@@ ti@@ p@@ li@@ ed it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : population , aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ wr@@ ite that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ all@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the num@@ er@@ ator incre@@ ases imp@@ act — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator dec@@ reas@@ es imp@@ act ."
"So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the num@@ er@@ ator — call it T@@ 1 — where it incre@@ ases imp@@ act , to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator — call it T@@ 2 — where it re@@ duc@@ es imp@@ act ?"
"I thought about the char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics of first indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution , T@@ 1 , as we pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed it at Inter@@ face , and it had the follo@@ wing char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics ."
E@@ x@@ trac@@ tive : taking ra@@ w materi@@ als from the ear@@ th .
"L@@ in@@ ear : take , make , wa@@ st@@ e ."
P@@ o@@ wer@@ ed by f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved energy .
W@@ a@@ ste@@ ful : ab@@ usi@@ ve and foc@@ used on l@@ ab@@ or produc@@ ti@@ vity .
M@@ ore car@@ pe@@ t per man@@ -@@ h@@ our .
"Th@@ in@@ king it through , I realized that all those at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es must be changed to move T to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"In the new indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution ex@@ trac@@ tive must be re@@ plac@@ ed by r@@ ene@@ w@@ able ; l@@ in@@ ear by cy@@ c@@ li@@ cal ; f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el energy by r@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy , s@@ un@@ light ; wa@@ ste@@ ful by wa@@ ste@@ -@@ free ; and ab@@ usi@@ ve by b@@ en@@ i@@ gn ; and l@@ ab@@ or produc@@ ti@@ vity by re@@ source produc@@ ti@@ vity ."
"And I reas@@ on@@ ed that if we could make those trans@@ forma@@ tive chan@@ ges , and get ri@@ d of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could re@@ duce our imp@@ act to z@@ er@@ o , inclu@@ ding our imp@@ act on the climate ."
"And that became the Inter@@ face pl@@ an in 199@@ 5 , and has been the pl@@ an ever since ."
We have meas@@ u@@ red our pro@@ gre@@ ss very ri@@ g@@ or@@ ously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as e@@ mi@@ ssi@@ ons down 8@@ 2 percent in ab@@ solu@@ te t@@ on@@ n@@ age .
( Applause ) O@@ ver the same sp@@ an of time s@@ al@@ es have incre@@ ased by tw@@ o@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds and prof@@ its have d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
So an 8@@ 2 percent ab@@ solu@@ te re@@ duc@@ tion trans@@ l@@ ates into a 9@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion in gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as in@@ ten@@ sity rela@@ tive to s@@ al@@ es .
This is the ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de of the re@@ duc@@ tion the entire global tech@@ n@@ osp@@ here must real@@ ize by 20@@ 50 to a@@ vo@@ id ca@@ ta@@ st@@ rop@@ hi@@ c climate dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tion — so the scientists are telling us .
"F@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el u@@ sa@@ ge is down 60 percent per un@@ it of produc@@ tion , du@@ e to eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es in r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"The che@@ ap@@ est , most sec@@ ure bar@@ re@@ l of o@@ il there is is the one not used through eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
W@@ ater u@@ sa@@ ge is down 7@@ 5 percent in our wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ le business .
"D@@ own 40 percent in our bro@@ ad@@ loo@@ m car@@ pe@@ t business , which we ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red in 199@@ 3 right here in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , C@@ ity of In@@ du@@ stry , where water is so pre@@ ci@@ ous ."
"@@ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materi@@ als are 25 percent of the t@@ ot@@ al , and gro@@ wing r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly ."
"@@ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is 2@@ 7 percent of our t@@ ot@@ al , going for 100 percent ."
"We have di@@ ver@@ ted 1@@ 4@@ 8 million p@@ ounds — that &apos;s 7@@ 4@@ ,000 t@@ ons — of used car@@ pe@@ t from l@@ and@@ f@@ ill@@ s , clos@@ ing the loo@@ p on materi@@ al flo@@ ws through re@@ ver@@ se logi@@ sti@@ c@@ s and pos@@ t-@@ con@@ su@@ m@@ er rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing techno@@ logi@@ es that did not ex@@ ist when we started 14 years ago ."
"Th@@ ose new cy@@ c@@ li@@ cal techno@@ logi@@ es have con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly to the fact that we have produc@@ ed and so@@ ld 8@@ 5 million squ@@ are y@@ ar@@ ds of c@@ li@@ mat@@ e-@@ ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al car@@ pe@@ t since 200@@ 4 , me@@ an@@ ing no net con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to global climate dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tion in produc@@ ing the car@@ pe@@ t throu@@ gh@@ out the supp@@ ly cha@@ in , from m@@ ine and well head cle@@ ar to end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ life rec@@ la@@ ma@@ tion — in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent th@@ ir@@ d-@@ par@@ ty cer@@ ti@@ fied ."
We call it C@@ ool C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t .
"And it has been a powerful mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place differ@@ enti@@ ator , incre@@ as@@ ing s@@ al@@ es and prof@@ its ."
"Th@@ ree years ago we la@@ un@@ ched car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ le for the home , under the br@@ and F@@ l@@ or , mis@@ sp@@ ell@@ ed F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R ."
You can point and c@@ li@@ ck today at F@@ l@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m and have C@@ ool C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t deli@@ vered to your front do@@ or in five days .
"It is pr@@ ac@@ tical , and pretty too ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ k@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : z@@ er@@ o imp@@ act , z@@ er@@ o fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
"We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our t@@ ar@@ get year for z@@ er@@ o , for re@@ ach@@ ing the top , the su@@ mm@@ it of M@@ oun@@ t S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to big@@ ger prof@@ its ."
Here is the business case for su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
"F@@ rom real life experience , cos@@ ts are down , not up , re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of a@@ vo@@ i@@ ded cos@@ ts in pur@@ su@@ it of z@@ er@@ o wa@@ st@@ e — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."
This has pa@@ id all the cos@@ ts for the trans@@ formation of Inter@@ face .
"And this di@@ sp@@ els a my@@ th too , this f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice between the environment and the econom@@ y ."
"O@@ ur produc@@ ts are the best they &apos;ve ever been , insp@@ i@@ red by design for su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , an u@@ nex@@ p@@ ected w@@ ell@@ sp@@ r@@ ing of inno@@ v@@ ation ."
O@@ ur people are g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ized around this shar@@ ed high@@ er pur@@ p@@ ose .
You cannot be@@ at it for at@@ trac@@ ting the best people and br@@ ing@@ ing them together .
And the go@@ o@@ d@@ will of the mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place is a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing .
"N@@ o amount of ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , no cle@@ ver mar@@ ke@@ ting ca@@ mp@@ ai@@ gn , at any pri@@ ce , could have produc@@ ed or created this much go@@ o@@ d@@ will ."
"C@@ os@@ ts , produc@@ ts , people , mar@@ ke@@ t@@ places — what else is there ?"
It is a better business model .
And here is our 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year rec@@ ord of s@@ al@@ es and prof@@ its .
"There is a di@@ p there , from 200@@ 1 to 200@@ 3 : a di@@ p when our s@@ al@@ es , over a th@@ ree@@ -@@ year per@@ i@@ od , were down 1@@ 7 percent ."
But the mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We liter@@ ally ga@@ ined market share .
We might not have survi@@ ved that rec@@ es@@ sion but for the adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ges of su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing Inter@@ face pl@@ ans , would that solve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I re@@ ma@@ in tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed by the re@@ vi@@ sed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , su@@ g@@ ge@@ sting that aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fra@@ med E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a lo@@ wer@@ case &apos; a , &apos; su@@ g@@ ge@@ sting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ iness — more happ@@ iness with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ fra@@ me ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of econom@@ ics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ds us : the su@@ sta@@ in@@ able species , living on a fin@@ ite ear@@ th , e@@ th@@ ic@@ ally , happ@@ i@@ ly and ec@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally in b@@ al@@ ance with nature and all her natural systems for a thous@@ and gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the in@@ defin@@ ite future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to wa@@ it for our ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"A@@ t Inter@@ face we really int@@ end to bring this prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pi@@ cal su@@ sta@@ in@@ able , z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int indu@@ stri@@ al company fully into ex@@ ist@@ ence by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , cle@@ ar to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the challenge is in ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vi@@ s@@ er A@@ m@@ ory L@@ o@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something ex@@ i@@ sts , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a pe@@ t@@ ro@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
"And if any@@ body can , it follo@@ ws that everybody can ."
"H@@ aw@@ ken ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed business and indu@@ stry , lead@@ ing human@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with contin@@ u@@ ed un@@ ch@@ ec@@ ked dec@@ line of the bi@@ osp@@ here , a very de@@ ar person is at risk here — f@@ ran@@ kly , an un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table risk ."
Wh@@ o is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me int@@ ro@@ duce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ tain clim@@ b .
"O@@ n a T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opport@@ unity back then , br@@ ing@@ ing them along and often not kno@@ wing whether I was connec@@ ting ."
"But about five days later back in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , I re@@ cei@@ ved an e@@ ma@@ il from G@@ l@@ en@@ n Th@@ om@@ as , one of my people in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a me@@ e@@ ting ."
He was sen@@ ding me an ori@@ gin@@ al po@@ e@@ m that he had comp@@ os@@ ed after our T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting mom@@ ents of my life .
"Because it told me , by G@@ od , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ l@@ en@@ n wr@@ ote . And here is that person , most at risk ."
"P@@ lease me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s C@@ hi@@ ld . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ n ."
A wi@@ se friend int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed us two .
"And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ at@@ en you ."
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , my d@@ aughter , son , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;ve just be@@ gu@@ n to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"@@ Be@@ g@@ in , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I squ@@ an@@ der , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s C@@ hi@@ ld &quot; &quot; has sp@@ o@@ ken to me with one simple but pro@@ found messa@@ ge , which I pre@@ su@@ me to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the we@@ b of life ."
"The contin@@ u@@ um of human@@ ity , sure , but in a lar@@ ger sense , the we@@ b of life itself ."
"And we have a cho@@ ice to make during our bri@@ e@@ f , bri@@ e@@ f vi@@ s@@ it to this beautiful bl@@ ue and green living planet : to h@@ ur@@ t it or to help it ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
Thank you .
