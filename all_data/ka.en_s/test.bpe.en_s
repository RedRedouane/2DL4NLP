T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about u@@ nex@@ pe@@ c@@ ted disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology in@@ du@@ str@@ y .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force our@@ selves into the environ@@ ment by pa@@ ying att@@ en@@ tion to ...
... pa@@ ying att@@ en@@ tion to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ sour@@ c@@ ing .
It &apos;s just a quic@@ k vi@@ de@@ o of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just sk@@ i@@ p — I &apos;ll just sk@@ i@@ p through the vi@@ de@@ o instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( M@@ u@@ sic ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
O@@ kay . ( Laughter )
S@@ o@@ lar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
O@@ kay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qui@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay att@@ en@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ul@@ arly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an a@@ w@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ te@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous g@@ l@@ ance , or maybe a very a@@ w@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ s@@ ha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about comm@@ uni@@ cation ."
"When we think about comm@@ uni@@ cation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a v@@ al@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ p@@ ing j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments can pre@@ di@@ ct really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ir@@ e or pr@@ om@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0-@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less c@@ li@@ ps of real phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess pre@@ di@@ ct whether or not that phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our th@@ ou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our phy@@ si@@ o@@ logy ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logi@@ st . I study pre@@ j@@ u@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive b@@ usiness school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic@@ s ."
I be@@ came es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally interest@@ ed in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the an@@ im@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re ba@@ sically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ sic@@ a T@@ r@@ acy has studi@@ ed ."
We make our@@ selves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really po@@ wer@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make our@@ selves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the cla@@ ss@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more li@@ ke@@ ly to do this kind of thing than men .
"@@ W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ r@@ on@@ ically less po@@ wer@@ ful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cla@@ ss@@ room , because par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So b@@ usiness scho@@ ols have been str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evi@@ dence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to s@@ mi@@ le by h@@ ol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ di@@ es , but is it also true that our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the po@@ wer@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the po@@ wer@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the po@@ wer@@ less look like ?
"So po@@ wer@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ri@@ s@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on test@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"@@ P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evi@@ dence , both that the body can shape the mind , at lea@@ st at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can shape the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation , this tiny inter@@ v@@ en@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be s@@ it@@ ting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really pr@@ ot@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on test@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it seems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about our@@ selves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also our@@ selves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ alu@@ ative s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ ord@@ ed .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
Pe@@ ople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ d@@ ers look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the con@@ ditions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effec@@ t , or medi@@ ating the effec@@ t ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an imp@@ os@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad ca@@ r ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a ca@@ r , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the ca@@ r .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had i@@ denti@@ fied with being s@@ mar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish college ."
I am an imp@@ os@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ a@@ ke it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to lea@@ ve you with is this .
T@@ iny tw@@ ea@@ ks can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your test@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t lea@@ ve that s@@ it@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in college , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ h@@ o@@ de I@@ s@@ land to P@@ ort@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ a@@ ds through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — ba@@ sically the lon@@ gest r@@ ou@@ te we can pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly take ."
"And some@@ where in the mi@@ ddle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ a@@ k@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my fri@@ end and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep see@@ ing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
M@@ y fri@@ end looks at me t@@ ot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the fron@@ t row who &apos;s doing a per@@ fe@@ ct im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sign@@ s we keep see@@ ing with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she c@@ r@@ ac@@ ks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fam@@ ous Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ n@@ ic are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ex@@ actly like this — why we some@@ times mis@@ understand the sign@@ s around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a stran@@ ge car@@ e@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge : no job com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to a@@ vo@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at lea@@ st to a@@ vo@@ id thinking about the pos@@ sibi@@ lity that we our@@ selves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes mi@@ sta@@ kes .
"The human speci@@ es , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the belie@@ f@@ s I hold , here in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bi@@ lity goes out the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the pres@@ ent ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go on family va@@ ca@@ tions in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go to the p@@ ol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se .
"So effec@@ tively , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bub@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , in our per@@ s@@ onal and profes@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us col@@ lec@@ tively as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est moral , intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ al and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you gu@@ ys something — or actually , let me ask you gu@@ ys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — em@@ oti@@ on@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You gu@@ ys are ans@@ w@@ ering the question : How does it feel to re@@ aliz@@ e you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ va@@ st@@ ating , it can be re@@ vel@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ p@@ id Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
Do you remem@@ ber that L@@ o@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always c@@ ha@@ sing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every e@@ pi@@ so@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is c@@ ha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ li@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a b@@ ir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the c@@ li@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at lea@@ st if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and re@@ aliz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we re@@ aliz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s g@@ one off the c@@ li@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ re@@ ct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feel@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tur@@ al reason , why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ ght@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tur@@ al .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re s@@ it@@ ting there in cla@@ ss , and your teacher is h@@ anding back qui@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know ex@@ actly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ ap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b k@@ id , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ sta@@ kes ."
We learn these really bad le@@ ss@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ spe@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just be@@ coming per@@ fe@@ ct little A students , per@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ ist@@ s , o@@ ver@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , a@@ stro@@ phy@@ si@@ ci@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , a@@ stro@@ phy@@ si@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we f@@ rea@@ k out at the pos@@ sibi@@ lity that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because acc@@ ord@@ ing to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel s@@ mar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Be@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
Be@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the op@@ er@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seems to have g@@ one f@@ ine .
"And she wa@@ kes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ag@@ es ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ag@@ es because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a ma@@ j@@ or op@@ er@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at Be@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el sp@@ o@@ ke about this inci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ at@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply f@@ el@@ t that he was on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ st@@ ing too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of anything can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ ght@@ ness that we all experience so o@@ f@@ ten is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining the pos@@ sibi@@ lity that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a hu@@ ge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a hu@@ ge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your belie@@ f@@ s just per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly re@@ f@@ le@@ ct reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by re@@ s@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone di@@ sa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re i@@ gn@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have acc@@ ess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pi@@ ec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty s@@ mar@@ t , then we move on to a th@@ ir@@ d as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are de@@ liber@@ ately dist@@ or@@ ting it for their own m@@ al@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a ca@@ ta@@ st@@ rop@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ ght@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mi@@ sta@@ kes when we ab@@ solu@@ tely need to and ca@@ us@@ es us to treat each other ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ ling and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mi@@ ss@@ es the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent w@@ in@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same w@@ in@@ d@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ b@@ ly bor@@ ing ."
The m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remem@@ ber the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same ni@@ ght sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ a@@ h , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ tes said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to s@@ cre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing de@@ fe@@ ct in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ di@@ ca@@ te or o@@ ver@@ come ."
It &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally f@@ und@@ am@@ ental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other an@@ im@@ als , we are ob@@ se@@ ss@@ ed with trying to fig@@ ure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ se@@ s@@ sion is the sour@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ st year , for v@@ ari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found my@@ self li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a lot of e@@ pi@@ so@@ des of the P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing and I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve l@@ ost it ."
I &apos;ve become the c@@ ra@@ z@@ y wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness la@@ dy .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ r@@ a G@@ la@@ ss , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single e@@ pi@@ so@@ de of our show has the same c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ r@@ a G@@ la@@ ss , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ s@@ al and wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ di@@ ence mem@@ bers , as li@@ st@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ ist@@ s and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se end@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ a@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a b@@ un@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss de@@ struc@@ tion , liber@@ ate the people and bring democ@@ r@@ acy to the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ a@@ st ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i M@@ u@@ bar@@ a@@ k thought he was going to be the dic@@ t@@ at@@ or of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sic@@ k and could pas@@ s the re@@ i@@ gn@@ s of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ t and move back to your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a b@@ un@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ b@@ ly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody h@@ ates for an au@@ di@@ ence that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredi@@ ble stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ es us ."
"@@ No off@@ en@@ se , but this enti@@ re con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ ument to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just sp@@ ent an enti@@ re wee@@ k talking about in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TE@@ D 19@@ 9@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ r@@ is ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you gu@@ ys have now heard se@@ ven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to ste@@ p outside of that tiny , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
Ma@@ ybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you gu@@ ys . ( Applause )
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been wor@@ king on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
It &apos;s a@@ w@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ le@@ ss@@ ing as a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an acc@@ ess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"@@ Not only am I fami@@ li@@ ar with the 50 st@@ ates in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vi@@ s@@ ited more than 1@@ 45 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time progra@@ ms in 8@@ 0 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"So our o@@ ver@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pr@@ om@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ vo@@ cation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , stran@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ dre@@ ss@@ ed quite o@@ f@@ ten , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ irst of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion of religi@@ ous scri@@ p@@ tures , h@@ o@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures , in the Bi@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ a@@ ment , New T@@ est@@ a@@ ment , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant pos@@ i@@ tions in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the m@@ os@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these r@@ ul@@ es to make s@@ ure that women are ordin@@ ari@@ ly rele@@ g@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary position com@@ par@@ ed to men in the ey@@ es of G@@ od .
This is a very ser@@ i@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ari@@ ly not ad@@ dre@@ ss@@ ed .
But the ba@@ sic thing is the scri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant position .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ va@@ sive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , for inst@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the ey@@ es of G@@ od , why should I treat them as equ@@ als my@@ self ?"
"The other very ser@@ i@@ ous b@@ light that ca@@ us@@ es this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive re@@ sort to violence , and that is increas@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as govern@@ or of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ v@@ en@@ f@@ old increase .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all el@@ e@@ ments of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing the de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to s@@ end a person to be ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ us@@ es of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ la@@ tion .
"And some@@ times , in more extre@@ me ca@@ ses but not very r@@ are ca@@ ses , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for inst@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ m@@ al@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in that way ."
This is a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble a@@ ff@@ li@@ c@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family be@@ comes m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the girl br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gr@@ ace to the family ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that re@@ l@@ ates to women partic@@ ul@@ arly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from A@@ fri@@ c@@ a into s@@ la@@ very in the New World back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now li@@ ving in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a m@@ and@@ ate from Con@@ gre@@ ss to give a rep@@ ort every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment rep@@ orts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national b@@ ord@@ ers every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 8@@ 0 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are li@@ ving in human b@@ on@@ d@@ age , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is lo@@ ca@@ ted and where I te@@ ach at E@@ m@@ ory Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to buy a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned girl br@@ ings se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ eds the t@@ ot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
S@@ wed@@ en has got a good approach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ wed@@ en decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted if they are in se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ imp@@ s and the m@@ ale cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion has g@@ one down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite position ."
"For every m@@ ale ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for il@@ le@@ g@@ al sex tra@@ de , 2@@ 5 women are ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the United States of America ."
"In the mi@@ lit@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ zing how many se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts take place ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and the reason is that the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ i@@ on in the Ar@@ my or a comp@@ any in the M@@ ar@@ ines — the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ te a r@@ ap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts are ta@@ king place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w ne@@ eds to be changed .
They &apos;re not pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ i@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al p@@ ay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is some@@ times mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I be@@ came pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 2@@ 5 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d World War .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying o@@ ver@@ head dro@@ pp@@ ing bomb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dr@@ ones that att@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the re@@ sort to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion of the h@@ o@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ us@@ es , are the ba@@ sic ca@@ us@@ es , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more ba@@ sic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qui@@ e@@ tly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ g@@ ed position that we o@@ cc@@ up@@ y , and this is very si@@ mil@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had exist@@ ed ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ g@@ ed position ."
So what is the ba@@ sic thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated and so for@@ th .
Thank you very much .
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ loc@@ k b@@ illions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ orm@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the valu@@ e of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my de@@ s@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ e@@ k@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es on my right ey@@ e ."
And I beg@@ an the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the valu@@ e of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I studi@@ ed , I me@@ t with medi@@ cal doc@@ tors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more in@@ sp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ v@@ olution , this new fe@@ min@@ ist is@@ sue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ lity sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having d@@ in@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four h@@ ours s@@ le@@ ep the ni@@ ght before .
"And I f@@ el@@ t like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I f@@ el@@ t like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this d@@ in@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a brea@@ k@@ fa@@ st d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re li@@ ke@@ ly to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ b@@ ly b@@ us@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in b@@ usiness , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ s .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were b@@ us@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a sist@@ er would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ o@@ ken up from a se@@ v@@ en@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ ght@@ -@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a per@@ s@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , effec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own car@@ e@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your ey@@ es and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ ines and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ r@@ is poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ c@@ tions and struc@@ ture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minu@@ te about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"@@ Here is this ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate itself con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the h@@ o@@ ly gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , and hop@@ e@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of pr@@ ot@@ op@@ la@@ s@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity emer@@ ges the whole spec@@ tru@@ m of abi@@ li@@ ties that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One approach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ sta@@ ined da@@ ma@@ ge to a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a g@@ ene@@ tic change in a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cogn@@ itive abi@@ lity ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive l@@ os@@ s of one fun@@ c@@ tion , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pre@@ ser@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ olved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ c@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ c@@ tion on@@ to struc@@ ture , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ c@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exa@@ mp@@ les of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exa@@ mp@@ les , six minutes each , d@@ uring this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the te@@ mp@@ or@@ al lob@@ es , fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , O@@ K — the lob@@ es that con@@ sti@@ tu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , t@@ uc@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the te@@ mp@@ or@@ al lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer recogn@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogn@@ ize them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ a@@ h , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogn@@ ize yourself in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it w@@ in@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogn@@ ize yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is well known as ca@@ used by da@@ ma@@ ge to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few phy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se comple@@ tely n@@ orm@@ al , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se comple@@ tely n@@ orm@@ al , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks ex@@ actly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and intellig@@ ent in all other re@@ spec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his d@@ el@@ u@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion of this , which you find in all the psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ b@@ oo@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this c@@ ha@@ p — and the same ar@@ g@@ ument app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about gu@@ ys ."
"When you &apos;re a little b@@ ab@@ y , a young b@@ ab@@ y , you had a strong se@@ x@@ u@@ al at@@ tr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , f@@ la@@ m@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ lica@@ b@@ ly you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; M@@ y G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion that makes sense to your da@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ g@@ ument ."
"It &apos;s very ing@@ en@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have se@@ en the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , about his pe@@ t p@@ oo@@ d@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks ex@@ actly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent be@@ sti@@ ality in all hum@@ ans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the struc@@ ture and fun@@ c@@ tions of the n@@ orm@@ al vi@@ su@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"@@ N@@ orm@@ ally , vi@@ su@@ al sign@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vi@@ sion , and after proc@@ ess@@ ing all that , the mes@@ sage goes to a small struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neurons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the abi@@ lity to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the mes@@ sage ca@@ s@@ ca@@ des into a struc@@ ture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the em@@ oti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , and that struc@@ ture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the em@@ oti@@ onal sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ d@@ at@@ or ? I@@ s it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ solu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ in@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can comple@@ tely i@@ gn@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mes@@ sa@@ ges then ca@@ s@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start swe@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from m@@ us@@ c@@ ular ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ t@@ un@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and measure the change in sk@@ in re@@ sist@@ ance produc@@ ed by swe@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minu@@ te .
"So my idea was , when this c@@ ha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as and , h@@ ow@@ ever , and it &apos;s proc@@ ess@@ ed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you recogn@@ ize it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the mes@@ sage ca@@ s@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this c@@ ha@@ p , that w@@ ir@@ e that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the em@@ oti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is int@@ act , the c@@ ha@@ p can still recogn@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ a@@ h , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ir@@ e is c@@ ut to the em@@ oti@@ onal cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ lica@@ ble l@@ ack of em@@ oti@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some stran@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in fron@@ t of a s@@ cre@@ en , and measure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the s@@ cre@@ en , I can measure how you swe@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ b@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t swe@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a li@@ on , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about n@@ orm@@ al people — you start swe@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the s@@ cre@@ en and measure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s and l@@ in@@ t , nothing happens , as in n@@ orm@@ al people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no em@@ oti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ir@@ e going from the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as to the em@@ oti@@ onal cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vi@@ sion is n@@ orm@@ al because the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as are n@@ orm@@ al , his em@@ oti@@ ons are n@@ orm@@ al — he &apos;ll la@@ u@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ir@@ e from vi@@ sion to em@@ oti@@ ons is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this d@@ el@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , see@@ min@@ g@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , neur@@ al psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome and say that the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a preci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neur@@ al an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the ph@@ one , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no d@@ el@@ u@@ sion through the ph@@ one ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the em@@ oti@@ onal cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the ph@@ one he recogn@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we approach this problem by con@@ si@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is a@@ mp@@ u@@ t@@ ated , or a le@@ g is a@@ mp@@ u@@ t@@ ated , for g@@ an@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ i@@ ous problem — you continu@@ e to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that mi@@ ss@@ ing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"@@ Be@@ li@@ e@@ ve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vi@@ sc@@ er@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ ster@@ ec@@ tom@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , in@@ clu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ str@@ u@@ al c@@ ra@@ mp@@ s at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for scienti@@ fi@@ c en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experi@@ ments ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s cla@@ i@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the ph@@ one when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ elling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not d@@ el@@ u@@ si@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But h@@ ow@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the ori@@ g@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al ner@@ ve su@@ p@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ ver@@ ed , was c@@ ut , by say , a m@@ ot@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on a@@ mp@@ u@@ t@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ i@@ ous cl@@ ini@@ cal problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ press@@ ed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you treat this sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves su@@ p@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the a@@ mp@@ u@@ ta@@ tion , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds comm@@ ands to the ar@@ m , the fron@@ t of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative l@@ ink , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve a@@ mp@@ u@@ t@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body i@@ ma@@ ge and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , so you can reli@@ e@@ ve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now s@@ end the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can reli@@ e@@ ve the ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ tom c@@ ra@@ m@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tu@@ al reality ."
But that cos@@ ts m@@ illions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my f@@ und@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r in the mi@@ ddle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m a@@ mp@@ u@@ t@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a br@@ achi@@ al a@@ v@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was a@@ mp@@ u@@ t@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he cou@@ ldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and the n@@ orm@@ al hand on the right side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion of the n@@ orm@@ al ar@@ m in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ gg@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ su@@ al imp@@ re@@ s@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again , and the pa@@ in , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remem@@ ber , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) M@@ y first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook at your re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ gg@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ p@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your n@@ orm@@ al hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your n@@ orm@@ al hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pa@@ in is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your ey@@ es . &quot; &quot; He cl@@ os@@ es his ey@@ es ."
&quot; And move your n@@ orm@@ al hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , op@@ en your ey@@ es . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s mo@@ ving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of vi@@ su@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a comple@@ tely us@@ el@@ ess abi@@ lity , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started re@@ aliz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is that you see in ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , like stro@@ ke , fo@@ cal d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can o@@ ver@@ come with the simple de@@ v@@ ice of using a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ er@@ e@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , take it home and pr@@ acti@@ ce with it for a wee@@ k or two ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe , after a peri@@ od of pr@@ acti@@ ce , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and start mo@@ ving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ e@@ ve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ a@@ ke it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two wee@@ ks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s g@@ one . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s g@@ one ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was g@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body i@@ ma@@ ge , what about human sub@@ jec@@ ts , e@@ th@@ ic@@ s and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ e@@ k , does this b@@ other you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ ar@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are g@@ one away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the desi@@ gn and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and e@@ li@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ici@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory con@@ f@@ li@@ ct .
It &apos;s getting mes@@ sa@@ ges from vi@@ sion saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , m@@ us@@ c@@ le sign@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ f@@ li@@ ct , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of d@@ en@@ i@@ al — it g@@ ates the sign@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ ed pa@@ in f@@ lo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other groups in H@@ el@@ sin@@ k@@ i , so it may pro@@ ve to be valu@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for stro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bi@@ li@@ ta@@ tion ."
"S@@ t@@ ro@@ ke you n@@ orm@@ ally think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of stro@@ ke par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be o@@ ver@@ come using m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also g@@ one through cl@@ ini@@ cal trials , hel@@ p@@ ing lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ar@@ s now to the th@@ ir@@ d part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disco@@ ver@@ ed by F@@ r@@ anc@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se comple@@ tely n@@ orm@@ al , had the follo@@ wing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is b@@ lu@@ e , se@@ ven is y@@ ell@@ ow , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"@@ Be@@ ar in mind , these people are comple@@ tely n@@ orm@@ al in other re@@ spec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — some@@ times , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke col@@ or ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is b@@ lu@@ e , F sh@@ ar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ ell@@ ow , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a , a min@@ g@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ in@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ ddle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pe@@ c@@ ts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in fami@@ lies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a g@@ ene@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this lec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a is eight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ us@@ es it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One theory is they &apos;re just c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fi@@ c theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ a@@ ds , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the th@@ ir@@ d theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask our@@ selves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a . A@@ ll right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remem@@ ber — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ros@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ mem@@ ber I said it run@@ s in fami@@ lies ?
That gi@@ ves you the clu@@ e .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ n@@ orm@@ al gen@@ e , a mu@@ ta@@ tion in the gen@@ e that ca@@ us@@ es this ab@@ n@@ orm@@ al c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain re@@ gi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other re@@ gi@@ on , and these are tri@@ mm@@ ed down to create the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ d@@ ular ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ mm@@ ing and if that gen@@ e mu@@ t@@ ates , then you get de@@ f@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ mm@@ ing between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
