Thank you so much . It &apos;s really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart .
I &apos;m here to tell you a few tales of passion .
There &apos;s a Jewish saying that I love .
What is truer than truth ? Answer : The story .
I &apos;m a storyteller . I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity .
"All stories interest me , and some haunt me until I end up writing them ."
"Certain themes keep coming up : justice , loyalty , violence , death , political and social issues , freedom ."
"I &apos;m aware of the mystery around us , so I write about coincidences , premonitions , emotions , dreams , the power of nature , magic ."
"In the last 20 years I have published a few books , but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 , when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy ."
"That made me a celebrity . Now people recognize me in Macy &apos;s , and my grandchildren think that I &apos;m cool ."
( Laughter ) Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .
"One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony , of the opening ceremony , called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers ."
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I &apos;m as far as you can get from being an athlete .
"Actually , I wasn &apos;t even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker ."
( Laughter ) I was told that this was no laughing matter .
This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag .
"Five women , representing five continents , and three Olympic gold medal winners ."
"My first question was , naturally , what was I going to wear ?"
"( Laughter ) A uniform , she said , and asked for my measurements ."
My measurements .
"I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak , looking like the Michelin Man ."
"( Laughter ) By the middle of February , I found myself in Turin , where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street ."
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games .
"They all deserved to win , but there &apos;s the element of luck ."
"A speck of snow , an inch of ice , the force of the wind , can determine the result of a race or a game ."
"However , what matters most — more than training or luck — is the heart ."
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal .
It is all about passion .
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics .
Passion lives here . Isn &apos;t it always true ?
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate .
That is what I need for my characters in my books : a passionate heart .
"I need mavericks , dissidents , adventurers , outsiders and rebels , who ask questions , bend the rules and take risks ."
People like all of you in this room .
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters .
( Laughter ) They only make good former spouses . ( Laughter )
"( Applause ) In the green room of the stadium , I met the other flag bearers : three athletes , and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren ."
"Also , two women with passionate hearts : Wangari Maathai , the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees . And by doing so , she has changed the soil , the weather , in some places in Africa , and of course the economic conditions in many villages ."
"And Somaly Mam , a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution ."
"When she was 14 years old , her grandfather sold her to a brothel ."
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS .
"And of brothels where children are forced to receive five , 15 clients per day , and if they rebel , they are tortured with electricity ."
In the green room I received my uniform .
"It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear , but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated . Not bad , really ."
I looked like a refrigerator .
"( Laughter ) But so did most of the flag-bearers , except Sophia Loren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion ."
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great .
"She &apos;s sexy , slim and tall , with a deep tan ."
"Now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles ?"
I don &apos;t know .
"When asked in a TV interview , &quot; &quot; How could she look so good ? &quot; &quot; She replied , &quot; &quot; Posture . My back is always straight , and I don &apos;t make old people &apos;s noises . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth ."
"No grunting , no coughing , no wheezing , no talking to yourselves , no farting ."
"( Laughter ) Well , she didn &apos;t say that exactly . ( Laughter )"
"At some point around midnight , we were summoned to the wings of the stadium , and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag , and the music started — by the way , the same music that starts here , the Aida March ."
"Sophia Loren was right in front of me — she &apos;s a foot taller than I am , not counting the poofy hair ."
"( Laughter ) She walked elegantly , like a giraffe on the African savannah , holding the flag on her shoulder . I jogged behind ( Laughter ) — on my tiptoes — holding the flag on my extended arm , so that my head was actually under the damn flag . ( Laughter )"
"All the cameras were , of course , on Sophia ."
"That was fortunate for me , because in most press photos I appear too , although often between Sophia &apos;s legs ."
( Laughter ) A place where most men would love to be . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium .
My husband is offended when I say this — although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes — ( Laughter ) — so he shouldn &apos;t take it personally .
"I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes , because I don &apos;t want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells ."
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics — passion .
So here &apos;s a tale of passion .
"The year is 1998 , the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo ."
"By the way , 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls ."
"We can call this place in Congo a death camp , because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation ."
"The protagonists of this story are a young woman , Rose Mapendo , and her children ."
She &apos;s pregnant and a widow .
Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed .
"Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to premature twins ."
Two tiny little boys .
"She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick , and ties it with her own hair ."
"She names the twins after the camp &apos;s commanders to gain their favor , and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them ."
"When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter , she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go , even when they hold a gun to her head ."
"Somehow , the family survives for 16 months , and then , by extraordinary luck , and the passionate heart of a young American man , Sasha Chanoff , who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane , Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix , Arizona , where they &apos;re now living and thriving ."
"Mapendo , in Swahili , means great love ."
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo .
I don &apos;t make them up . There &apos;s no need for that .
I look around and I see them everywhere .
I have worked with women and for women all my life .
I know them well .
"I was born in ancient times , at the end of the world , in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family ."
"No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist — although the term had not reached Chile yet , so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me ."
"( Laughter ) I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom , and for questioning the patriarchy ."
"But I was happy to pay it , because for every blow that I received , I was able to deliver two ."
"( Laughter ) Once , when my daughter Paula was in her twenties , she said to me that feminism was dated , that I should move on ."
We had a memorable fight . Feminism is dated ?
"Yes , for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today , but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage , prostitution , forced labor — they have children that they don &apos;t want or they cannot feed ."
They have no control over their bodies or their lives .
They have no education and no freedom .
"They are raped , beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity ."
"For most Western young women of today , being called a feminist is an insult ."
"Feminism has never been sexy , but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting , and I have seldom suffered from lack of men ."
"( Laughter ) Feminism is not dead , by no means ."
"It has evolved . If you don &apos;t like the term , change it , for Goddess &apos; sake ."
"Call it Aphrodite , or Venus , or bimbo , or whatever you want ; the name doesn &apos;t matter , as long as we understand what it is about , and we support it ."
"So here &apos;s another tale of passion , and this is a sad one ."
The place is a small women &apos;s clinic in a village in Bangladesh .
The year is 2005 .
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three-week vacation .
"She &apos;s prepared to clean teeth , but when she gets there , she finds out that there are no doctors , no dentists , and the clinic is just a hut full of flies ."
"Outside , there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated ."
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars .
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth .
She &apos;s not licensed for that ; she has never done it .
She risks a lot and she &apos;s terrified .
"She doesn &apos;t even have the proper instruments , but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine ."
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart .
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation .
"At the end , the relieved patient kisses her hands ."
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth .
"The next morning , when she comes again to the so-called clinic , her first patient is waiting for her with her husband ."
The woman &apos;s face looks like a watermelon .
It is so swollen that you can &apos;t even see the eyes .
"The husband , furious , threatens to kill the American ."
"Jenny is horrified at what she has done , but then the translator explains that the patient &apos;s condition has nothing to do with the operation ."
"The day before , her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him ."
Millions of women live like this today .
They are the poorest of the poor .
"Although women do two-thirds of the world &apos;s labor , they own less than one percent of the world &apos;s assets ."
"They are paid less than men for the same work if they &apos;re paid at all , and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence , and they are constantly threatened by exploitation , violence and abuse ."
"It is a fact that giving women education , work , the ability to control their own income , inherit and own property , benefits the society ."
"If a woman is empowered , her children and her family will be better off ."
"If families prosper , the village prospers , and eventually so does the whole country ."
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya .
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees .
"She gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop ."
"In a matter of five or six years , they have a forest , the soil is enriched , and the village is saved ."
The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down .
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy .
"For every dollar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s programs ."
Women are 51 percent of humankind .
Empowering them will change everything — more than technology and design and entertainment .
"I can promise you that women working together — linked , informed and educated — can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet ."
"In any war today , most of the casualties are civilians , mainly women and children . They are collateral damage ."
"Men run the world , and look at the mess we have ."
What kind of world do we want ?
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ?
"We want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody , not only for the privileged ."
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero &apos;s paintings at the UC Berkeley library .
"No museum or gallery in the United States , except for the New York gallery that carries Botero &apos;s work , has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison ."
"They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the voluminous Botero style ."
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart .
What I fear most is power with impunity .
"I fear abuse of power , and the power to abuse ."
"In our species , the alpha males define reality , and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules ."
"The rules change all the time , but they always benefit them , and in this case , the trickle-down effect , which does not work in economics , works perfectly ."
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom .
"Women and children , especially the poor , are at the bottom ."
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse — a woman or a child .
"I &apos;m fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender , income , race , and class ."
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization .
"But for real change , we need feminine energy in the management of the world ."
"We need a critical number of women in positions of power , and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men ."
"I &apos;m talking about men with young minds , of course ."
Old guys are hopeless ; we have to wait for them to die off .
"( Laughter ) Yes , I would love to have Sophia Loren &apos;s long legs and legendary breasts ."
"But given a choice , I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai , Somaly Mam , Jenny and Rose Mapendo ."
I want to make this world good .
"Not better , but to make it good ."
"Why not ? It is possible . Look around in this room — all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology ."
"Let &apos;s get off our fannies , roll up our sleeves and get to work , passionately , in creating an almost perfect world ."
Thank you .
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
There are an enormous number of them that we use every day .
"We use gestures not only to interact with these objects , but we also use them to interact with each other ."
It comes as a part of our everyday learning .
"Rather than using a keyboard and mouse , why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world ?"
"So , I started this exploration around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my desk ."
"Rather than using it for my computer , I actually opened it ."
"Interestingly , what I did with these rollers is , basically , I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line ."
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
What I got is basically a gesture-interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .
"But you can also search in the digital world , or maybe you can write a query , saying , &quot; What is Dr. Smith &apos;s address ? &quot;"
"In another exploration , I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions ."
"So , I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions , but they can actually draw , so that it &apos;s more intuitive to use that way ."
"If I put a boarding pass , it will show me where the flight gate is ."
"So , these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly ."
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
We want to know about dynamic things going around .
"I think that &apos;s why this is called a head-mounted projector , isn &apos;t it ?"
But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go .
"You can start using any surface , any wall around you , as an interface ."
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
"Whatever you &apos;re doing with your hands , it &apos;s understanding that gesture ."
"You stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall ."
"But we are not only tracking one finger , here ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"And , of course , if you don &apos;t have any surface , you can start using your palm for simple operations ."
"Here , I &apos;m dialing a phone number just using my hand ."
Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated .
"So , rather than waiting for that , I actually made my own , just using a piece of paper ."
"I removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that — like I just made a clip out of the microphone — and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around ."
So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I &apos;m touching the paper .
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving .
You can of course watch movies .
"( Video ) Good afternoon . My name is Russell , and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54 . &quot; &quot; PM : And you can of course play games ."
"When I come back to my desk , I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer ."
( Applause ) And why only computers ? We can just play with papers .
Paper world is interesting to play with .
"Here , I &apos;m taking a part of a document , and putting over here a second part from a second place , and I &apos;m actually modifying the information that I have over there ."
"Yeah . And I say , &quot; &quot; OK , this looks nice , let me print it out , that thing . &quot; &quot; So I now have a print-out of that thing ."
"Chris Anderson : So , Pranav , first of all , you &apos;re a genius ."
"This is incredible , really ."
What are you doing with this ? Is there a company being planned ?
CA : Open source ? Wow .
"( Applause ) CA : Are you going to come back to India with some of this , at some point ?"
CA : What are your plans ? MIT ? India ?
How are you going to split your time going forward ?
All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India .
"And now , if you see , it &apos;s more about the cost-effectiveness : this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20,000 surface tables , or anything like that ."
"Or maybe even the $ 2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ 5,000 ?"
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fantastic .
So magic is a very introverted field .
"While scientists regularly publish their latest research , we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets ."
That &apos;s true even amongst peers .
"But if you look at creative practice as a form of research , or art as a form of R &amp; D for humanity , then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research ?"
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
"And about three years ago , I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic — tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster ."
"Today , I &apos;d like to show you something which came out of these collaborations ."
"It &apos;s an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system , or a digital storytelling tool ."
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .
And I &apos;m going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life .
( Applause ) ( Music ) Terribly sorry . I forgot the floor .
Wake up .
Hey .
Come on .
( Music ) Please . ( Music )
Come on .
"Ah , sorry about that ."
Forgot this .
( Music ) Give it another try .
Okay .
He figured out the system .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Uh oh . ( Music )
All right . Let &apos;s try this .
Come on .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) ( Music ) Hey . ( Music )
"You heard her , go ahead ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Bye-bye . ( Applause )
"Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters ."
"Ever since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language ."
"But to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China ."
"Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so ."
"I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful ."
"Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence ."
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
"Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way ."
"A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters ."
"You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy ."
"The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature — enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers ."
Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
Person .
"If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; &quot; — This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but I like to think that way . Whichever works for you ."
This is a tree .
Tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radicals .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
"If someone walks behind , that is &quot; &quot; to follow . &quot; &quot; As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd ."
"If a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped ."
"He &apos;s a prisoner , just like Jonah inside the whale ."
"One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods ."
"Three trees together , we create the forest ."
"Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation ."
"Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; idiot . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic ."
Remember fire ?
"Two fires together , I get really hot ."
"Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames ."
"Set the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning ."
"For us , the sun is the source of prosperity ."
"Two suns together , prosperous ."
"Three together , that &apos;s sparkles ."
"Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s brightness ."
"It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night ."
The sun is coming up above the horizon . Sunrise .
"A door . Put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt ."
"Put a mouth inside the door , asking questions ."
Knock knock . Is anyone home ?
"This person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading ."
"On the left , we have a woman ."
"Two women together , they have an argument ."
"( Laughter ) Three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery ."
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
"By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 ."
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
"So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old ."
"So after we know the characters , we start building phrases ."
"For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a volcano ."
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .
"This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China ."
"So a sun , origin together , we build Japan ."
"A person behind Japan , what do we get ?"
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
"In ancient China , that means in exile , because Chinese emperors , they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains ."
"Nowadays , exile has turned into getting out ."
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .
( Applause )
"Thank you very much , Chris . Everybody who came up here said they were scared . I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m scared , but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this ."
And I don &apos;t have any smart technology for you to look at .
"There are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me ."
( Laughter ) What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa .
"Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time : the Africa of HIV / AIDS , the Africa of malaria , the Africa of poverty , the Africa of conflict , and the Africa of disasters ."
"While it is true that those things are going on , there &apos;s an Africa that you don &apos;t hear about very much ."
"And sometimes I &apos;m puzzled , and I ask myself why ."
"This is the Africa that is changing , that Chris alluded to ."
This is the Africa of opportunity .
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies .
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this . That &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa .
"On 15th of September 2005 , Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha , a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria , was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London ."
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family .
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria — led by one of our most able and courageous people : Mr. Nuhu Ribadu .
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London .
"Due to some slip-ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where , according to our constitution , those in office as governors , president — as in many countries — have immunity and cannot be prosecuted . But what happened : people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office ."
"Today , Alams — as we call him for short — is in jail ."
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders .
"This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good , and not taken out to places where they &apos;ll benefit just a few of the elite ."
"And therefore , when you hear about the corrupt Africa — corruption all the time — I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries , and that some successes are emerging ."
Does it mean the problem is over ? The answer is no .
"There &apos;s still a long way to go , but that there &apos;s a will there ."
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight .
"So when you hear about corruption , don &apos;t just feel that nothing is being done about this — that you can &apos;t operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption . That is not the case ."
"There &apos;s a will to fight , and in many countries , that fight is ongoing and is being won . In others , like mine , where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria , the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go ."
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on .
"The results are showing : independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption , and governance is improving ."
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries .
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance .
"That is that people talk about corruption , corruption ."
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa .
"That &apos;s the image : African countries . But let me say this : if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London — if the other people who had taken money , estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries &apos; monies sitting abroad in the developed countries — if they &apos;re able to do this , what is that ? Is that not corruption ?"
"In this country , if you receive stolen goods , are you not prosecuted ?"
"So when we talk about this kind of corruption , let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe — where the money &apos;s going and what can be done to stop it ."
"I &apos;m working on an initiative now , along with the World Bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad — developing countries &apos; moneys — to get that sent back ."
"Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back , it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together ."
( Applause ) The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform .
"Africans , after — they &apos;re tired , we &apos;re tired of being the subject of everybody &apos;s charity and care ."
"We are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform ."
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us . We have to do it .
"We can invite partners who can support us , but we have to start ."
"We have to reform our economies , change our leadership , become more democratic , be more open to change and to information ."
"And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent , Nigeria ."
"In fact , if you &apos;re not in Nigeria , you &apos;re not in Africa ."
I want to tell you that .
"( Laughter ) One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian , and it has 140 million dynamic people — chaotic people — but very interesting people . You &apos;ll never be bored . ( Laughter )"
What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
"And with the support of a leader who was willing , at the time , to do the reforms , we put forward a comprehensive reform program , which we developed ourselves ."
"Not the International Monetary Fund . Not the World Bank , where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president ."
No one can do it for you . You have to do it for yourself .
"We put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing — it had no business being in ."
The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it &apos;s inefficient and incompetent .
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises .
"( Applause ) We — as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets ."
"Can you believe that prior to this reform — which started at the end of 2003 , when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister — we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history ?"
( Laughter ) Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
You couldn &apos;t get it . You had to bribe .
You had to do everything to get your phone .
"When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector , we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines , and counting ."
"Nigeria &apos;s telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world , after China . We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms . And nobody knows , except a few smart people ."
"( Laughter ) The smartest one , first to come in , was the MTN company of South Africa ."
"And in the three years that I was Finance Minister , they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year ."
"360 million in a market — in a country that is a poor country , with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita ."
So the market is there .
"When they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know ."
"Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies , and three or four others have come in ."
"But there &apos;s a huge market out there , and people don &apos;t know about it , or they don &apos;t want to know ."
So privatization is one of the things we &apos;ve done .
The other thing we &apos;ve also done is to manage our finances better .
Because nobody &apos;s going to help you and support you if you &apos;re not managing your own finances well .
"And Nigeria , with the oil sector , had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well ."
So what did we try to do ? We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price .
"Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in , because oil is the biggest , most revenue-earning sector in the economy : 70 percent of our revenues come from oil ."
"We de-linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price ."
We didn &apos;t know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial .
"But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development — where , even if oil prices were high , we would grow very fast ."
"When they crashed , we crashed ."
"And we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy ."
"That smoothened out . We were able to save , just before I left , 27 billion dollars . Whereas — and this went to our reserves — when I arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves ."
"By the time I left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . And as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances ."
"And that shores up our economy , makes it stable ."
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy .
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now .
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy .
"And what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diversify — and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in Africa — what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-oil ."
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
"As telecoms sector grew , housing and construction , and I could go on and on . And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out , the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous ."
"We have opportunities in agriculture , like I said ."
"We have opportunities in solid minerals . We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored . And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible , that wouldn &apos;t happen . So we &apos;ve now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world ."
We have opportunities in housing and real estate .
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people — no shopping malls as you know them here .
This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people .
"And now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected ."
"So , huge things in construction , real estate , mortgage markets . Financial services : we had 89 banks . Too many not doing their real business ."
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital — share capital .
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
"The banks — these banks are now consolidated , and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside ."
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million .
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million .
"And I can go on . Dollars , on and on , into the system ."
We are doing the same with the insurance sector .
"So in financial services , a great deal of opportunity ."
"In tourism , in many African countries , a great opportunity ."
"And that &apos;s what many people know East Africa for : the wildlife , the elephants , and so on ."
But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important .
So what am I trying to say ? I &apos;m trying to tell you that there &apos;s a new wave on the continent .
"A new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections ."
"Not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear ."
"I &apos;m trying to tell you that since the past three years , the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum ."
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
So it &apos;s clear that things are changing .
"Conflicts are down on the continent ; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago , we are down to three or four conflicts — one of the most terrible , of course , of which is Darfur ."
"And , you know , you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent , it looks like the entire continent is affected ."
"But you should know that this continent is not — is a continent of many countries , not one country ."
"And if we are down to three or four conflicts , it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable , growing , exciting economies where there &apos;s plenty of opportunity ."
And I want to just make one point about this investment .
The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet .
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs .
There &apos;s no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children &apos;s lives . That &apos;s not what I &apos;m saying . That is fine .
"But imagine the impact on a family : if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves ."
"If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet , isn &apos;t that a wonderful opportunity ? Isn &apos;t that the way to go ?"
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women .
( Applause ) I have a CD here . I &apos;m sorry that I didn &apos;t say anything on time .
"Otherwise , I would have liked you to have seen this ."
"It says , &quot; &quot; Africa : Open for Business . &quot; &quot; And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year ."
"Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania , where they &apos;re having the session in June ."
"But it shows you Africans , and particularly African women , who against all odds have developed businesses , some of them world-class ."
"One of the women in this video , Adenike Ogunlesi , making children &apos;s clothes — which she started as a hobby and grew into a business ."
"Mixing African materials , such as we have , with materials from elsewhere ."
"So , she &apos;ll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys , with African material mixed in . Very creative designs , has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart ."
"( Laughter ) For 10,000 pieces ."
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .
And the women are diligent . They are focused ; they work hard .
"I could go on giving examples : Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda , who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her ."
"However , many of these are starved for capital to expand , because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary . Nobody thinks in terms of a market ."
Nobody thinks there &apos;s opportunity .
"But I &apos;m standing here saying that those who miss the boat now , will miss it forever ."
"So if you want to be in Africa , think about investing ."
"Think about the Beatrices , think about the Adenikes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed , and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income ."
So I invite you to explore the opportunities .
"When you go to Tanzania , listen carefully , because I &apos;m sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent , for the people and for yourselves ."
Thank you very much .

Let me tell you a story .
It goes back 200 million years .
"It &apos;s a story of the neocortex , which means &quot; &quot; new rind . &quot; &quot; So in these early mammals , because only mammals have a neocortex , rodent-like creatures ."
"It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin , and was a thin covering around their walnut-sized brain , but it was capable of a new type of thinking ."
"Rather than the fixed behaviors that non-mammalian animals have , it could invent new behaviors ."
"So a mouse is escaping a predator , its path is blocked , it &apos;ll try to invent a new solution ."
"That may work , it may not , but if it does , it will remember that and have a new behavior , and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community ."
"Another mouse watching this could say , &quot; Hey , that was pretty clever , going around that rock , &quot; and it could adopt a new behavior as well ."
Non-mammalian animals couldn &apos;t do any of those things .
They had fixed behaviors .
Now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course of one lifetime .
"In the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes , it could evolve a new fixed behavior ."
That was perfectly okay 200 million years ago .
The environment changed very slowly .
"It could take 10,000 years for there to be a significant environmental change , and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior ."
"Now that went along fine , but then something happened ."
"Sixty-five million years ago , there was a sudden , violent change to the environment ."
We call it the Cretaceous extinction event .
"That &apos;s when the dinosaurs went extinct , that &apos;s when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct , and that &apos;s when mammals overtook their ecological niche , and to anthropomorphize , biological evolution said , &quot; Hmm , this neocortex is pretty good stuff , &quot; and it began to grow it ."
"And mammals got bigger , their brains got bigger at an even faster pace , and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area ."
"If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out , it &apos;s about the size of a table napkin , and it &apos;s still a thin structure ."
It &apos;s about the thickness of a table napkin .
"But it has so many convolutions and ridges it &apos;s now 80 percent of our brain , and that &apos;s where we do our thinking , and it &apos;s the great sublimator ."
"We still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations , but I may have a drive for conquest , and that &apos;ll be sublimated by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a TED Talk , and it &apos;s really the neocortex that &apos;s where the action is ."
"Fifty years ago , I wrote a paper describing how I thought the brain worked , and I described it as a series of modules ."
Each module could do things with a pattern .
It could learn a pattern . It could remember a pattern .
It could implement a pattern .
"And these modules were organized in hierarchies , and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking ."
And there was actually very little to go on 50 years ago .
It led me to meet President Johnson .
"I &apos;ve been thinking about this for 50 years , and a year and a half ago I came out with the book &quot; How To Create A Mind , &quot; which has the same thesis , but now there &apos;s a plethora of evidence ."
The amount of data we &apos;re getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year .
Spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year .
"We can now see inside a living brain and see individual interneural connections connecting in real time , firing in real time ."
We can see your brain create your thoughts .
"We can see your thoughts create your brain , which is really key to how it works ."
So let me describe briefly how it works .
I &apos;ve actually counted these modules .
"We have about 300 million of them , and we create them in these hierarchies ."
I &apos;ll give you a simple example .
"A beautiful song can play , a pretty girl could walk by , they don &apos;t care , but they see a crossbar to a capital A , they get very excited and they say &quot; &quot; crossbar , &quot; &quot; and they put out a high probability on their output axon ."
"That goes to the next level , and these layers are organized in conceptual levels ."
"Each is more abstract than the next one , so the next one might say &quot; &quot; capital A. &quot; &quot; That goes up to a higher level that might say &quot; &quot; Apple . &quot; &quot; Information flows down also ."
"If the apple recognizer has seen A-P-P-L , it &apos;ll think to itself , &quot; &quot; Hmm , I think an E is probably likely , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;ll send a signal down to all the E recognizers saying , &quot; &quot; Be on the lookout for an E , I think one might be coming . &quot; &quot; The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing , could be an E."
"Ordinarily you wouldn &apos;t think so , but we &apos;re expecting an E , it &apos;s good enough , and yeah , I &apos;ve seen an E , and then apple says , &quot; Yeah , I &apos;ve seen an Apple . &quot;"
"Go up another five levels , and you &apos;re now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy , and stretch down into the different senses , and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric , hears a certain voice quality , smells a certain perfume , and will say , &quot; &quot; My wife has entered the room . &quot; &quot; Go up another 10 levels , and now you &apos;re at a very high level ."
"You &apos;re probably in the frontal cortex , and you &apos;ll have modules that say , &quot; &quot; That was ironic ."
"That &apos;s funny . She &apos;s pretty . &quot; &quot; You might think that those are more sophisticated , but actually what &apos;s more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them ."
"There was a 16-year-old girl , she had brain surgery , and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her ."
You can do that because there &apos;s no pain receptors in the brain .
"And whenever they stimulated particular , very small points on her neocortex , shown here in red , she would laugh ."
"So at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex , but no , they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor , and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points ."
"&quot; You guys are so funny just standing around , &quot; was the typical comment , and they weren &apos;t funny , not while doing surgery ."
So how are we doing today ?
"Well , computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex ."
"I actually described the algorithm , which is similar to something called a hierarchical hidden Markov model , something I &apos;ve worked on since the &apos; 90s ."
"&quot; &quot; Jeopardy &quot; &quot; is a very broad natural language game , and Watson got a higher score than the best two players combined ."
"It got this query correct : &quot; &quot; A long , tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping , &quot; &quot; and it quickly responded , &quot; &quot; What is a meringue harangue ? &quot; &quot; And Jennings and the other guy didn &apos;t get that ."
"It &apos;s a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language , and it actually got its knowledge by reading Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias ."
"Five to 10 years from now , search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding , reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books ."
"So you &apos;ll be walking along , and Google will pop up and say , &quot; &quot; You know , Mary , you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn &apos;t getting past the blood-brain barrier ."
"Well , new research just came out 13 seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione ."
"Let me summarize it for you . &quot; &quot; Twenty years from now , we &apos;ll have nanobots , because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology ."
They &apos;ll go into our brain through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud providing an extension of our neocortex .
"Now today , I mean , you have a computer in your phone , but if you need 10,000 computers for a few seconds to do a complex search , you can access that for a second or two in the cloud ."
"In the 2030s , if you need some extra neocortex , you &apos;ll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain ."
"So I &apos;m walking along and I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , there &apos;s Chris Anderson ."
He &apos;s coming my way .
I &apos;d better think of something clever to say .
I &apos;ve got three seconds .
My 300 million modules in my neocortex isn &apos;t going to cut it .
"And our thinking , then , will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking , but the non-biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns ."
It will grow exponentially .
And remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex ?
That was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads .
Other primates have a slanted brow .
They don &apos;t have the frontal cortex .
But the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different .
"It &apos;s a quantitative expansion of neocortex , but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and invent language and art and science and technology and TED conferences ."
No other species has done that .
"And so , over the next few decades , we &apos;re going to do it again ."
"We &apos;re going to again expand our neocortex , only this time we won &apos;t be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure ."
It &apos;ll be expanded without limit .
That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;ve noticed something interesting about society and culture .
"For some reason , there &apos;s no standard syllabus , there &apos;s no basic course ."
The space bar scrolls down one page .
You make the text larger with each tap .
"Go space , space ."
Double click the word .
"Also , don &apos;t delete what you &apos;ve highlighted ."
You can just type over it .
So I know I went super fast .
"It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence , and I believe this is true , especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success ."
"Well , I can tell you that , in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system , also known as pressure cooker , not everyone can do well in that environment ."
"While many people responded in different ways about our education system , my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building ."
Why bows ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
"Perhaps , in the face of constant pressure , my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows ."
"If you think about it , the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times ."
"The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty , where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves ."
"In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact , the government has planted mulberry trees ."
The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics .
"The area near these walls , which nobody bothers to pay attention to , had been left free from major intervention , and this is where I first found my treasures ."
"As I fell deeper into bow making , I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood ."
"When I went on school field trips , family vacations , or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes , I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag ."
"And they would be somethings like saws , knives , sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel ."
"I would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands ."
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach .
Airport security .
"( Laughter ) In the privacy of my room , covered in sawdust , I would saw , trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape ."
"One day , I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire ."
"Where ? The rooftop of my apartment building , a place where 96 families call home ."
"A customer from a department store across from my building called 911 , and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned ."
"I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom , in the audience today : Mom , I was really sorry , and I will be more careful with open fire from now on ."
"My mother had to do a lot of explaining , telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson ."
I also researched extensively on bows around the world .
"In that process , I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow ."
"I also worked with many different types of wood , such as maple , yew and mulberry , and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before ."
The most effective bow for me would be like this .
One : Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow .
"Two : Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight , which means more power ."
Three : Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage .
And four : Horn used to store energy in compression .
"After fixing , breaking , redesigning , mending , bending and amending , my ideal bow began to take shape , and when it was finally done , it looked like this ."
I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own .
"This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum , and see how my bow resembles them ."
"Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention . ( Laughter ) Through bowmaking , I came in contact with part of my heritage ."
Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
"You see , I searched far and wide , but never bothered to look close and near ."
"From this realization , I began to take interest in Korean history , which had never inspired me before ."
"In the end , the grass is often greener on my side of the fence , although we don &apos;t realize it ."
"Now , I am going to show you how my bow works ."
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
"This is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights ."
"( Noise of shooting arrow ) ( Applause ) A bow may function in a simple mechanism , but in order to make a good bow , a great amount of sensitivity is required ."
You need to console and communicate with the wood material .
"Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow ."
"I may be an &#91; odd &#93; student with unconventional interests , but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you ."
"My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fibers and the tendons in a bow , a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient ."
"The bow resembles me , and I resemble the bow ."
"Now , I am shooting a part of myself to you ."
"No , better yet , a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind ."
Did it strike you ?
Thank you .

"As an artist , connection is very important to me ."
Through my work I &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
"I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first icebergs ."
I was in awe .
"My heart beat fast , my head was dizzy , trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me ."
"The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake , year after year ."
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
Each iceberg has its own individual personality .
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
"Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion ."
"It &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves ."
But the reality is far from it .
"As an iceberg melts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere ."
"As the iceberg melts , it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life ."
"I approach photographing these icebergs as if I &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again ."
"It is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life ."
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young — a couple thousand years old .
"And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old ."
"The last pictures I &apos;d like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq , Greenland ."
It &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
So here it is .
You can see on the left side a small boat .
That &apos;s about a 15-foot boat .
And I &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline .
"You can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there ."
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg .
"It &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters ."
And this video is real time .
"( Music ) And just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , stepping down out of the bus , I headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session ."
"It was the winter of 2009 , and I had been blind for about a year ."
Things were going pretty well .
"Safely reaching the other side , I turned to the left , pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal , and waited my turn ."
"As it went off , I took off and safely got to the other side ."
"Stepping onto the sidewalk , I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me ."
"I know there &apos;s a cafe on the corner , and they have chairs out in front , so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street ."
"As I did , so slid the chair ."
"I just figured I &apos;d made a mistake , and went back to the right , and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity ."
Now I was getting a little anxious .
"I went back to the left , and so slid the chair , blocking my path of travel ."
"Now , I was officially freaking out ."
"So I yelled , &quot; Who the hell &apos;s out there ? What &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
"Just then , over my shout , I heard something else , a familiar rattle ."
"It sounded familiar , and I quickly considered another possibility , and I reached out with my left hand , as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy , and I came across an ear , the ear of a dog , perhaps a golden retriever ."
"Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me , perhaps get a scratch behind the ear ."
"Who knows , maybe she was volunteering for service ."
"( Laughter ) But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight , seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you ."
So let me step back and set the stage a little bit .
"On St. Patrick &apos;s Day of 2008 , I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor ."
The surgery was successful .
"Two days later , my sight started to fail ."
"On the third day , it was gone ."
"Immediately , I was struck by an incredible sense of fear , of confusion , of vulnerability , like anybody would ."
"But as I had time to stop and think , I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for ."
"In particular , I thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery ."
He was 36 . I was seven at the time .
"So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead , and had no clue quite what was going to happen , I was alive ."
My son still had his dad .
"And besides , it &apos;s not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight ."
"I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful , active life without sight ."
"So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later , I left with a mission , a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life ."
"Within six months , I had returned to work ."
My training had started .
"I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies , and was commuting to work on my own , walking through town and taking the bus ."
It was a lot of hard work .
But what I didn &apos;t anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time .
"From that came a lot of insights , or outsights , as I called them , things that I learned since losing my sight ."
"These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound , from the mundane to the humorous ."
"As an architect , that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself ."
"Paramount amongst those was the realization that , actually , cities are fantastic places for the blind ."
And then I was also surprised by the city &apos;s propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself .
That was a little curious to me .
Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
"Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses , things that you would otherwise maybe ignore ."
It &apos;s like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you .
"I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are , how you need to move , and where you need to go ."
"Similarly , just through the grip of the cane , you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below , and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you &apos;re headed ."
"Similarly , just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space ."
"But also , the sense of smell ."
"Some districts and cities have their own smell , as do places and things around you , and if you &apos;re lucky , you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you &apos;ve been looking for ."
"All this really surprised me , because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi-sensory than my sighted experience ever was ."
What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me .
"When you &apos;re sighted , everybody kind of sticks to themselves , you mind your own business ."
"Lose your sight , though , and it &apos;s a whole other story ."
"And I don &apos;t know who &apos;s watching who , but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me ."
"And I &apos;m not paranoid , but everywhere I go , I &apos;m getting all sorts of advice : Go here , move there , watch out for this ."
A lot of the information is good .
Some of it &apos;s helpful . A lot of it &apos;s kind of reversed .
You &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually meant .
Some of it &apos;s kind of wrong and not helpful .
But it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things .
"But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway , and came to a corner ."
"I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal , and as it went off , I was just about to step out into the street , when all of a sudden , my right hand was just gripped by this guy , and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street , speaking to me in Mandarin ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s like , there was no escape from this man &apos;s death grip , but he got me safely there ."
What could I do ?
"But believe me , there are more polite ways to offer assistance ."
"We don &apos;t know you &apos;re there , so it &apos;s kind of nice to say &quot; &quot; Hello &quot; &quot; first ."
&quot; Would you like some help ? &quot;
"But while in Oakland , I &apos;ve really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight ."
I liked it sighted . It was fine .
It &apos;s a perfectly great city .
"But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway , I was blessed every block of the way ."
"&quot; Bless you , man . &quot;"
"&quot; Go for it , brother . &quot;"
&quot; God bless you . &quot;
I didn &apos;t get that sighted .
"( Laughter ) And even without sight , I don &apos;t get that in San Francisco ."
"And I know it bothers some of my blind friends , it &apos;s not just me ."
Often it &apos;s thought that that &apos;s an emotion that comes up out of pity .
"I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity , out of our togetherness , and I think it &apos;s pretty cool ."
"In fact , if I &apos;m feeling down , I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland , I go for a walk , and I feel better like that , in no time at all ."
"But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic , social , racial , economic lines ."
Disability is an equal-opportunity provider .
Everybody &apos;s welcome .
"In fact , I &apos;ve heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : There are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven &apos;t quite found theirs yet ."
"It &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but I think it &apos;s kind of beautiful , because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled , and it &apos;s a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life ."
"So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind , but the city needs us ."
"And I &apos;m so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities , and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast ."
It &apos;s too late then .
"So if you design a city with the blind in mind , you &apos;ll have a rich , walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level ."
"If you design a city with the blind in mind , sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous ."
The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
"In fact , cars , who needs them ?"
"If you &apos;re blind , you don &apos;t drive . ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t like it when you drive . ( Laughter ) If you design a city with the blind in mind , you design a city with a robust , accessible , well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around . If you design a city with the blind in mind ,"
"there &apos;ll be jobs , lots of jobs ."
Blind people want to work too .
They want to earn a living .
"So , in designing a city for the blind , I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive , a more equitable , a more just city for all ."
"And based on my prior sighted experience , it sounds like a pretty cool city , whether you &apos;re blind , whether you have a disability , or you haven &apos;t quite found yours yet ."
So thank you .
( Applause )
Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
It &apos;s an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey .
Let me begin with my parents .
I &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
"Many years ago , when I was born in the &apos; 50s — &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s didn &apos;t belong to girls in India ."
They belonged to boys .
"They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents , and girls would be dolled up to get married ."
"My family , in my city , and almost in the country , was unique ."
"We were four of us , not one , and fortunately no boys ."
We were four girls and no boys .
And my parents were part of a landed property family .
"My father defied his own grandfather , almost to the point of disinheritance , because he decided to educate all four of us ."
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education .
"As I &apos;ve said , when we &apos;re born , we don &apos;t choose our parents , and when we go to school , we don &apos;t choose our school ."
Children don &apos;t choose a school .
They just get the school which parents choose for them .
So this is the foundation time which I got .
"I grew up like this , and so did my other three sisters ."
"And my father used to say at that time , &quot; I &apos;m going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world . &quot;"
"I don &apos;t know if he really meant &#91; that &#93; , but it happened ."
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
"One is a British , another is an American and the third is a Canadian ."
So we are four of us in four corners of the world .
"And since I said they &apos;re my role models , I followed two things which my father and mother gave me ."
"One , they said , &quot; &quot; Life is on an incline ."
"You either go up , or you come down . &quot; &quot; And the second thing , which has stayed with me , which became my philosophy of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad ."
"Out of 100 , 90 are your creation ."
They &apos;re good . They &apos;re your creation . Enjoy it .
"If they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . Learn from it ."
Ten are nature-sent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
"It &apos;s like a death of a relative , or a cyclone , or a hurricane , or an earthquake ."
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just respond to the situation .
But that response comes out of those 90 points .
"Since I &apos;m a product of this philosophy , of 90 / 10 , and secondly , &quot; &quot; life on an incline , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the way I grew up to be valuing what I got ."
"I &apos;m a product of opportunities , rare opportunities in the &apos; 50s and the &apos; 60s , which girls didn &apos;t get , and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique ."
"Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry , and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities ."
I thought I must tell you this .
"Why I said this , is the background ."
This is what comes next .
"I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman , a woman with indefatigable stamina , because I used to run for my tennis titles , etc ."
"But I joined the Indian Police Service , and then it was a new pattern of policing ."
"For me the policing stood for power to correct , power to prevent and power to detect ."
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India — the power to prevent .
"Because normally it was always said , power to detect , and that &apos;s it , or power to punish ."
"But I decided no , it &apos;s a power to prevent , because that &apos;s what I learned when I was growing up ."
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
"So this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men ."
"I didn &apos;t want to make it different from the men , but it was different , because this was the way I was different ."
And I redefined policing concepts in India .
"I &apos;m going to take you on two journeys , my policing journey and my prison journey ."
"What you see , if you see the title called &quot; &quot; PM &apos;s car held . &quot; &quot; This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket ."
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time in India , and I can tell you , that &apos;s the last time you &apos;re hearing about it ."
"It &apos;ll never happen again in India , because now it was once and forever ."
"And the rule was , because I was sensitive , I was compassionate , I was very sensitive to injustice , and I was very pro-justice ."
"That &apos;s the reason , as a woman , I joined the Indian Police Service ."
"I had other options , but I didn &apos;t choose them ."
So I &apos;m going to move on .
"This is about tough policing , equal policing ."
"Now I was known as &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to listen . &quot; &quot; So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings , postings which others would say no ."
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .
Normally police officers don &apos;t want to do prison .
"They sent me to prison to lock me up , thinking , &quot; &quot; Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to ."
Let &apos;s lock her up . &quot; &quot; Here I got a prison assignment .
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals .
"Obviously , it was ."
"But 10,000 men , of which only 400 were women — 10,000 — 9,000 plus about 600 were men ."
"Terrorists , rapists , burglars , gangsters — some of them I &apos;d sent to jail as a police officer outside ."
And then how did I deal with them ?
"The first day when I went in , I didn &apos;t know how to look at them ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? &quot; &quot; When I looked at the group , I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? &quot; &quot; They saw me as a young , short woman wearing a pathan suit . I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? &quot; &quot;"
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? Do you want to pray ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; All right , let &apos;s pray . &quot; &quot; I prayed for them , and things started to change ."
This is a visual of education inside the prison .
"Friends , this has never happened , where everybody in the prison studies ."
I started this with community support .
Government had no budget .
"It was one of the finest , largest volunteerism in any prison in the world ."
This was initiated in Delhi prison .
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class .
These are hundreds of classes .
"Nine to eleven , every prisoner went into the education program — the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten ."
We converted this into an ashram — from a prison to an ashram through education .
I think that &apos;s the bigger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
Teachers were prisoners . Teachers were volunteers .
Books came from donated schoolbooks .
Stationery was donated .
"Everything was donated , because there was no budget of education for the prison ."
"Now if I &apos;d not done that , it would have been a hellhole ."
That &apos;s the second landmark .
"I want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world ."
"One , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see ."
"Secondly , this concept ."
"This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners ."
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation .
This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor .
And this is what transformed .
"You want to know more about this , go and see this film , &quot; &quot; Doing Time , Doing Vipassana . &quot; &quot; You will hear about it , and you will love it ."
"And write to me on KiranBedi.com , and I &apos;ll respond to you ."
Let me show you the next slide .
"I took the same concept of mindfulness , because , why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison ?"
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind .
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control .
"Not by preaching , not by telling , not by reading , but by addressing your mind ."
"I took the same thing to the police , because police , equally , were prisoners of their minds , and they felt as if it was &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; they , &quot; &quot; and that the people don &apos;t cooperate ."
This worked .
This is a feedback box called a petition box .
"This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints , listen to grievances ."
This was a magic box .
This was a sensitive box .
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison .
"If you see somebody in the blue — yeah , this guy — he was a prisoner , and he was a teacher ."
"And you see , everybody &apos;s busy . There was no time to waste ."
Let me wrap it up .
"I &apos;m currently into movements , movements of education of the under-served children , which is thousands — India is all about thousands ."
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India .
"That &apos;s a big way we , as a small group of activists , have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India ."
"Friends , you will hear a lot about it ."
"That &apos;s the movement at the moment I &apos;m driving , and that &apos;s the movement and ambition of my life ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
"So the Awesome story : It begins about 40 years ago , when my mom and my dad came to Canada ."
"My mom left Nairobi , Kenya ."
"My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar , India ."
And they got here in the late 1960s .
"They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto , and they settled into a new life ."
"They saw their first dentist , they ate their first hamburger , and they had their first kids ."
"My sister and I grew up here , and we had quiet , happy childhoods ."
"We had close family , good friends , a quiet street ."
"We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn &apos;t take for granted when they grew up — things like power always on in our houses , things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard ."
"We grew up , and we grew older ."
I went to high school .
I graduated .
"I moved out of the house , I got a job , I found a girl , I settled down — and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens &apos; song — ( Laughter ) but life was pretty good ."
Life was pretty good .
2006 was a great year .
"Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario , I got married , surrounded by 150 family and friends ."
2007 was a great year .
"I graduated from school , and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends ."
"Here &apos;s a picture of me and my friend , Chris , on the coast of the Pacific Ocean ."
"We actually saw seals out of our car window , and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads ."
"( Laughter ) So you can &apos;t actually see them , but it was breathtaking , believe me . ( Laughter )"
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher .
"I know that they were tougher for a lot of people , not just me ."
"First of all , the news was so heavy ."
"It &apos;s still heavy now , and it was heavy before that , but when you flipped open a newspaper , when you turned on the TV , it was about ice caps melting , wars going on around the world , earthquakes , hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse , and then eventually did collapse , and so many of us losing our homes , or our jobs , or our retirements , or our livelihoods ."
"2008 , 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason , too ."
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time .
"My marriage wasn &apos;t going well , and we just were growing further and further apart ."
"One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage , through a lot of tears , to have a very honest conversation ."
"And she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t love you anymore , &quot; &quot; and it was one of the most painful things I &apos;d ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I &apos;d ever heard , until only a month later , when I heard something even more heartbreaking ."
"My friend Chris , who I just showed you a picture of , had been battling mental illness for some time ."
"And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be ."
I spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m.
on a Sunday night .
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening .
"And Monday morning , I found out that he disappeared ."
"Very sadly , he took his own life ."
And it was a really heavy time .
"And as these dark clouds were circling me , and I was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow ."
"So I came home from work one night , and I logged onto the computer , and I started up a tiny website called 1000awesomethings.com."
"I was trying to remind myself of the simple , universal , little pleasures that we all love , but we just don &apos;t talk about enough — things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking , being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding , wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer , or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line — even if you were last at the other line , swoop right in there ."
"( Laughter ) And slowly over time , I started putting myself in a better mood ."
"I mean , 50,000 blogs are started a day , and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 ."
And nobody read it except for my mom .
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad .
"( Laughter ) And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits , and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions ."
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger .
"And then I got a phone call , and the voice at the other end of the line said , &quot; You &apos;ve just won the Best Blog In the World award . &quot;"
"I was like , that sounds totally fake ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to ? ( Laughter )
"But it turns out , I jumped on a plane , and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart ."
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog .
"And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto , when , in my inbox , 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book ."
Flash-forward to the next year and &quot; &quot; The Book of Awesome &quot; &quot; has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks .
"( Applause ) But look , I said I wanted to do three things with you today ."
"I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story , I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome , and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought ."
So let &apos;s talk about those three As .
"Over the last few years , I haven &apos;t had that much time to really think ."
"But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself : &quot; &quot; What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website , but also grow myself ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve summarized those things , for me personally , as three As ."
"They are Attitude , Awareness and Authenticity ."
I &apos;d love to just talk about each one briefly .
"So Attitude : Look , we &apos;re all going to get lumps , and we &apos;re all going to get bumps ."
"None of us can predict the future , but we do know one thing about it and that &apos;s that it ain &apos;t gonna go according to plan ."
"We will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages , father-daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room , but between those high highs , we may also have some lumps and some bumps too ."
"It &apos;s sad , and it &apos;s not pleasant to talk about , but your husband might leave you , your girlfriend could cheat , your headaches might be more serious than you thought , or your dog could get hit by a car on the street ."
"It &apos;s not a happy thought , but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes ."
"Your mom could get cancer , your dad could get mean ."
"And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well , too , with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart , and when that bad news washes over you , and when that pain sponges and soaks in , I just really hope you feel like you &apos;ve always got two choices ."
"One , you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever , or two , you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes ."
"Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two , and choosing , no matter how difficult it is , no matter what pain hits you , choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future ."
The second &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot; is Awareness .
I love hanging out with three year-olds .
"I love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time ."
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk .
"I love the way that they &apos;ll stare slack-jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand , soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs ."
I love the way that they &apos;ll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner .
"I love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time ."
Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old .
Because you all used to be three years old .
That three-year-old boy is still part of you .
That three-year-old girl is still part of you .
They &apos;re in there .
"And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you &apos;ve seen for the first time once , too ."
So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
"There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air , or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said , &quot; &quot; Found money . &quot; &quot; The last &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot; is Authenticity ."
"And for this one , I want to tell you a quick story ."
"Let &apos;s go all the way back to 1932 when , on a peanut farm in Georgia , a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born ."
"Roosevelt Grier , or Rosey Grier , as people used to call him , grew up and grew into a 300-pound , six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL ."
He &apos;s number 76 in the picture .
Here he is pictured with the &quot; &quot; fearsome foursome . &quot; &quot; These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against .
"They were tough football players doing what they love , which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field ."
But Rosey Grier also had another passion .
"In his deeply authentic self , he also loved needlepoint . ( Laughter ) He loved knitting ."
"He said that it calmed him down , it relaxed him , it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks ."
That &apos;s what he said .
"I mean , he loved it so much that , after he retired from the NFL , he started joining clubs ."
And he even put out a book called &quot; &quot; Rosey Grier &apos;s Needlepoint for Men . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a great cover .
"If you notice , he &apos;s actually needlepointing his own face ."
"( Laughter ) And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is all about ."
It &apos;s just about being you and being cool with that .
"And I think when you &apos;re authentic , you end up following your heart , and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy ."
You meet people that you like talking to .
You go places you &apos;ve dreamt about .
And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled .
So those are the three A &apos;s .
"For the closing thought , I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada ."
I don &apos;t know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you &apos;re in your mid-20s .
"I don &apos;t know , because I never did it , but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude ."
I would imagine that you &apos;d have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you &apos;re starting to see in your new world .
"And I think you &apos;d have to be really authentic , you &apos;d have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you &apos;re being exposed to ."
"I &apos;d like to pause my TEDTalk for about 10 seconds right now , because you don &apos;t get many opportunities in life to do something like this , and my parents are sitting in the front row ."
"So I wanted to ask them to , if they don &apos;t mind , stand up ."
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys .
"( Applause ) When I was growing up , my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada ."
"And it &apos;s a great story , because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport , and he was welcomed by a non-profit group , which I &apos;m sure someone in this room runs ."
( Laughter ) And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada .
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread .
"There was bread , there was those little , mini dill pickles , there was olives , those little white onions ."
"There was rolled up turkey cold cuts , rolled up ham cold cuts , rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese ."
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches .
"There was lasagna , there was casseroles , there was brownies , there was butter tarts , and there was pies , lots and lots of pies ."
"And when my dad tells the story , he says , &quot; &quot; The craziest thing was , I &apos;d never seen any of that before , except bread ."
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know what was meat , what was vegetarian ."
I was eating olives with pie .
"( Laughter ) I just couldn &apos;t believe how many things you can get here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When I was five years old , my dad used to take me grocery shopping , and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables ."
"He would say , &quot; &quot; Look , can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico ?"
They &apos;ve got an apple here from South Africa .
"Can you believe they &apos;ve got a date from Morocco ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Do you know where Morocco even is ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m five . I don &apos;t even know where I am ."
"Is this A &amp; P ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know where Morocco is either , but let &apos;s find out . &quot; &quot; And so we &apos;d buy the date , and we &apos;d go home ."
"And we &apos;d actually take an atlas off the shelf , and we &apos;d flip through until we found this mysterious country ."
"And when we did , my dad would say , &quot; &quot; Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there , picked this thing off it , put it in a truck , drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house , so they could sell it to us for 25 cents ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe it either ."
"Things are amazing . There &apos;s just so many things to be happy about . &quot; &quot; When I stop to think about it , he &apos;s absolutely right ."
There are so many things to be happy about .
"We are the only species on the only life-giving rock in the entire universe that we &apos;ve ever seen , capable of experiencing so many of these things ."
"I mean , we &apos;re the only ones with architecture and agriculture ."
We &apos;re the only ones with jewelry and democracy .
"We &apos;ve got airplanes , highway lanes , interior design and horoscope signs ."
"We &apos;ve got fashion magazines , house party scenes ."
You can watch a horror movie with monsters .
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming .
"We &apos;ve got books , buffets and radio waves , wedding brides and rollercoaster rides ."
You can sleep in clean sheets .
You can go to the movies and get good seats .
"You can smell bakery air , walk around with rain hair , pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap ."
"We &apos;ve got all that , but we &apos;ve only got 100 years to enjoy it ."
And that &apos;s the sad part .
"The cashiers at your grocery store , the foreman at your plant , the guy tailgating you home on the highway , the telemarketer calling you during dinner , every teacher you &apos;ve ever had , everyone that &apos;s ever woken up beside you , every politician in every country , every actor in every movie , every single person in your family , everyone you love , everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years ."
Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet .
"And that moment is right now , and those moments are counting down , and those moments are always , always , always fleeting ."
You will never be as young as you are right now .
"And that &apos;s why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude , choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow , living with a sense of awareness of the world around you , embracing your inner three year-old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself , being you and being cool with that , letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you , then I think you &apos;ll live a life that is rich and is satisfying , and I think you &apos;ll live a life that is truly awesome ."
Thank you .
"It &apos;s a pleasure to be here in Edinburgh , Scotland , the birthplace of the needle and syringe ."
"Less than a mile from here in this direction , in 1853 a Scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe ."
"His name was Alexander Wood , and it was at the Royal College of Physicians ."
This is the patent .
What blows my mind when I look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today .
"Yet , it &apos;s 160 years old ."
So we turn to the field of vaccines .
"Most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe , this 160-year-old technology ."
"And credit where it &apos;s due — on many levels , vaccines are a successful technology ."
"After clean water and sanitation , vaccines are the one technology that has increased our life span the most ."
That &apos;s a pretty hard act to beat .
"But just like any other technology , vaccines have their shortcomings , and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative — this old technology ."
So let &apos;s start with the obvious : Many of us don &apos;t like the needle and syringe .
I share that view .
"However , 20 percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia ."
That &apos;s more than disliking the needle ; that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia .
And that &apos;s problematic in terms of the rollout of vaccines .
"Now , related to this is another key issue , which is needlestick injuries ."
And the WHO has figures that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year take place due to cross-contamination with needlestick injuries .
These are early deaths that take place .
"Now , these are two things that you probably may have heard of , but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you may not have heard about ."
One is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses .
And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I &apos;ll tell you about as well .
I &apos;m going to tell you about some work that my team and I are doing in Australia at the University of Queensland on a technology designed to tackle those four problems .
And that technology is called the Nanopatch .
"Now , this is a specimen of the Nanopatch ."
"To the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp , but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye ."
"And there &apos;s about 4,000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle ."
"And I &apos;ve designed those projections to serve a key role , which is to work with the skin &apos;s immune system ."
So that &apos;s a very important function tied in with the Nanopatch .
Now we make the Nanopatch with a technique called deep reactive ion etching .
"And this particular technique is one that &apos;s been borrowed from the semiconductor industry , and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers ."
Now we dry-coat vaccines to the projections of the Nanopatch and apply it to the skin .
"Now , the simplest form of application is using our finger , but our finger has some limitations , so we &apos;ve devised an applicator ."
And it &apos;s a very simple device — you could call it a sophisticated finger .
It &apos;s a spring-operated device .
What we do is when we apply the Nanopatch to the skin as so — ( Click ) — immediately a few things happen .
"So firstly , the projections on the Nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released — within less than a minute , in fact ."
Then we can take the Nanopatch off and discard it .
And indeed we can make a reuse of the applicator itself .
"So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch , and immediately you can see some key advantages ."
"We &apos;ve talked about it being needle-free — these are projections that you can &apos;t even see — and , of course , we get around the needle phobia issue as well ."
"Now , if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages : One is improved immune responses through delivery , and the second is getting rid of the cold chain ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one , this immunogenicity idea ."
"It takes a little while to get our heads around , but I &apos;ll try to explain it in simple terms ."
So I &apos;ll take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way .
So vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ .
"Now that safe germ , that antigen , tricks our body into mounting an immune response , learning and remembering how to deal with intruders ."
When the real intruder comes along the body quickly mounts an immune response to deal with that vaccine and neutralizes the infection .
So it does that well .
"Now , the way it &apos;s done today with the needle and syringe , most vaccines are delivered that way — with this old technology and the needle ."
But it could be argued that the needle is holding back our immune responses ; it &apos;s missing our immune sweet spot in the skin .
"To describe this idea , we need to take a journey through the skin , starting with one of those projections and applying the Nanopatch to the skin ."
And we see this kind of data .
"Now , this is real data — that thing that we can see there is one projection from the Nanopatch that &apos;s been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers ."
"Now , to give you an idea of scale , if the needle was shown here , it would be too big ."
"It would be 10 times bigger than the size of that screen , going 10 times deeper as well ."
It &apos;s off the grid entirely .
You can see immediately that we have those projections in the skin .
"That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin , but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of immune cells ."
"As one example , in the brown layer there &apos;s a certain type of cell called a Langerhans cell — every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those Langerhans cells , those immune cells , and there &apos;s others shown as well that we haven &apos;t stained in this image ."
But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed .
We target thousands upon thousands of these particular cells just residing within a hair &apos;s width of the surface of the skin .
"Now , as the guy that &apos;s invented this thing and designed it to do that , I found that exciting . But so what ?"
So what if you &apos;ve targeted cells ?
"In the world of vaccines , what does that mean ?"
The world of vaccines is getting better .
It &apos;s getting more systematic .
"However , you still don &apos;t really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait ."
It &apos;s a gambler &apos;s game even today .
"So , we had to do that gamble ."
"We obtained an influenza vaccine , we applied it to our Nanopatches and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin , and we waited — and this is in the live animal ."
"We waited a month , and this is what we found out ."
This is a data slide showing the immune responses that we &apos;ve generated with a Nanopatch compared to the needle and syringe into muscle .
So on the horizontal axis we have the dose shown in nanograms .
"On the vertical axis we have the immune response generated , and that dashed line indicates the protection threshold ."
If we &apos;re above that line it &apos;s considered protective ; if we &apos;re below that line it &apos;s not .
"So the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there &apos;s only one point that is achieved with the needle that &apos;s protective , and that &apos;s with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms ."
But notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line .
That &apos;s what &apos;s achieved with the Nanopatch ; the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve .
That &apos;s a real fresh opportunity .
Suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines .
"We can push it one way , where we can take a vaccine that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle ."
"That can take a vaccine that &apos;s suddenly 10 dollars down to 10 cents , and that &apos;s particularly important within the developing world ."
But there &apos;s another angle to this as well — you can take vaccines that currently don &apos;t work and get them over that line and get them protective .
And certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important .
"Let &apos;s consider the big three : HIV , malaria , tuberculosis ."
"They &apos;re responsible for about 7 million deaths per year , and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those ."
"So potentially , with this new lever that we have with the Nanopatch , we can help make that happen ."
We can push that lever to help get those candidate vaccines over the line .
"Now , of course , we &apos;ve worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this , what we &apos;ve achieved with influenza ."
"I &apos;d like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today &apos;s vaccines , and that is the need to maintain the cold chain ."
"As the name suggests — the cold chain — it &apos;s the requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied , to keep it refrigerated ."
"Now , that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it ."
"This is a slightly extreme case in point but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges , in particular in resource-poor settings , of what &apos;s required to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain ."
"If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down , but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well ."
"Now , the stakes are very high ."
"The WHO estimates that within Africa , up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the cold chain has fallen over ."
"So it &apos;s a big problem , and it &apos;s tied in with the needle and syringe because it &apos;s a liquid form vaccine , and when it &apos;s liquid it needs the refrigeration ."
"A key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry , and when it &apos;s dry it doesn &apos;t need refrigeration ."
Within my lab we &apos;ve shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all .
That &apos;s an important improvement .
( Applause ) We &apos;re delighted about it as well .
And the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting .
"And as a scientist , I love that and I love science ."
"However , as an engineer , as a biomedical engineer and also as a human being , I &apos;m not going to be satisfied until we &apos;ve rolled this thing out , taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most ."
"So we &apos;ve commenced this particular journey , and we &apos;ve commenced this journey in an unusual way ."
We &apos;ve started with Papua New Guinea .
"Now , Papua New Guinea is an example of a developing world country ."
"It &apos;s about the same size as France , but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today &apos;s vaccines ."
There &apos;s the logistics : Within this country there are only 800 refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled .
"Many of them are old , like this one in Port Moresby , many of them are breaking down and many are not in the Highlands where they are required ."
That &apos;s a challenge .
"But also , Papua New Guinea has the world &apos;s highest incidence of HPV , human papillomavirus , the cervical cancer &#91; risk factor &#93; ."
"Yet , that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it &apos;s too expensive ."
"So for those two reasons , with the attributes of the Nanopatch , we &apos;ve got into the field and worked with the Nanopatch , and taken it to Papua New Guinea and we &apos;ll be following that up shortly ."
"Now , doing this kind of work is not easy ."
"It &apos;s challenging , but there &apos;s nothing else in the world I &apos;d rather be doing ."
And as we look ahead I &apos;d like to share with you a thought : It &apos;s the thought of a future where the 17 million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote .
"And it &apos;s a historical footnote that has been achieved by improved , radically improved vaccines ."
"Now standing here today in front of you at the birthplace of the needle and syringe , a device that &apos;s 160 years old , I &apos;m presenting to you an alternative approach that could really help make that happen — and it &apos;s the Nanopatch with its attributes of being needle-free , pain-free , the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science .
I bring you into a room .
"He gathered his participants and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can solve this problem . &quot;"
Incentivize them .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close ."
"Rewards , by their very nature , narrow our focus , concentrate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many cases ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who sponsored this research ?
The good news is that the scientists who &apos;ve been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
Mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
"In the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management ."
Management did not emanate from nature .
Somebody invented it .
"But if you want engagement , self-direction works better ."
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian ?
And they do something incredibly cool .
"Autonomy , mastery and purpose , the building blocks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another encyclopedia got started ."
The drive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
"Ladies and gentlemen , gather around ."
I would love to share with you a story .
"Once upon a time in 19th century Germany , there was the book ."
"Now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling ."
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
"Because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device ."
"But then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever ."
"( Music ) His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer ."
"Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , &quot; &quot; Genug ist genug ! &quot; &quot; He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors ."
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as — who else ? — the world &apos;s first true inventor of the children &apos;s pop-up book .
"( Music ) For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced ."
"( Cheering ) They were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning ."
"Lothar Meggendorfer wasn &apos;t the first to evolve the way a story was told , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the last ."
"Whether storytellers realized it or not , they were channeling Meggendorfer &apos;s spirit when they moved opera to vaudville , radio news to radio theater , film to film in motion to film in sound , color , 3D , on VHS and on DVD ."
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis .
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around .
"( Laughter ) Because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices ."
"For example , one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine ."
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D .
( Laughter ) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate .
"And after all this , everyone paused ; they took a step back ."
"They realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they &apos;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls ."
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
"And for the most part , the stories are recycled ."
"But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty ."
"And they remembered a man , one amazing German , every time a new storytelling device popped up next ."
"And for that , the audience — the lovely , beautiful audience — would live happily ever after ."
( Applause )
"And what I &apos;m wondering is , of those three things , is any one of them surviving some kind of trauma ?"
"Cancer survivor , rape survivor , Holocaust survivor , incest survivor ."
Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves by our wounds ?
And where I have seen this survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community .
"And I &apos;ve been around this community for a long time , because I &apos;ve been a hospice and a hospital chaplain for almost 30 years ."
"And in 2005 , I was working at a big cancer center when I received the news that my mother had breast cancer ."
"And then five days later , I received the news that I had breast cancer ."
My mother and I can be competitive — ( Laughter ) — but I was really not trying to compete with her on this one .
"And in fact , I thought , well , if you have to have cancer , it &apos;s pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it ."
But this is what I heard from a lot of outraged people .
What ?
You &apos;re the chaplain .
You should be immune .
"Like , maybe I should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket , because I &apos;m on the force ."
"And then I &apos;ll move or I &apos;ll gesture and they &apos;ll go , &quot; No , it &apos;s that one . &quot;"
So now you know .
"I learned a lot being a patient , and one of the surprising things was that only a small part of the cancer experience is about medicine ."
Most of it is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity and discovering strength and flexibility you never even knew you had .
"It &apos;s about realizing that the most important things in life are not things at all , but relationships , and it &apos;s about laughing in the face of uncertainty and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say , &quot; &quot; I have cancer . &quot; &quot; So the other thing I learned was that I don &apos;t have to take on &quot; &quot; cancer survivor &quot; &quot; as my identity , but , boy , are there powerful forces pushing me to do just that ."
"Now , don &apos;t , please , misunderstand me ."
"Cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer , and this is a wonderful thing ."
We can now talk about cancer without whispering .
We can talk about cancer and we can support one another .
"But sometimes , it feels like people go a little overboard and they start telling us how we &apos;re going to feel ."
"So about a week after my surgery , we had a houseguest ."
That was probably our first mistake .
"And keep in mind that at this point in my life I had been a chaplain for over 20 years , and issues like dying and death and the meaning of life , these are all things I &apos;d been yakking about forever ."
"So at dinner that night , our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head , and say , &quot; &quot; You know , Deb , now you &apos;re really going to learn what &apos;s important ."
"Yes , you are going to make some big changes in your life , and now you &apos;re going to start thinking about your death ."
"Yep , this cancer is your wakeup call . &quot; &quot; Now , these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience , but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel , it &apos;s instant crap ."
The only reason I did not kill him with my bare hands was because I could not lift my right arm .
"But I did say a really bad word to him , followed by a regular word , that — ( Laughter ) — made my husband say , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s on narcotics . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then after my treatment , it just felt like everyone was telling me what my experience was going to mean ."
"&quot; Oh , this means you &apos;re going to be doing the walk . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , this means you &apos;re coming to the luncheon . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; This means you &apos;re going to be wearing the pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt and the headband and the earrings and the bracelet and the panties . &quot; &quot; Panties . No , seriously , google it ."
( Laughter ) How is that raising awareness ?
Only my husband should be seeing my panties .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s pretty aware of cancer already .
"It was at that point where I felt like , oh my God , this is just taking over my life ."
"And that &apos;s when I told myself , claim your experience ."
Don &apos;t let it claim you .
"We all know that the way to cope with trauma , with loss , with any life-changing experience , is to find meaning ."
But here &apos;s the thing : No one can tell us what our experience means .
We have to decide what it means .
"And it doesn &apos;t have to be some gigantic , extroverted meaning ."
We don &apos;t all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary .
Meaning can be quiet and introverted .
Maybe we make one small decision about our lives that can bring about big change .
"Many years ago , I had a patient , just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff , and so it was something of a shock to us to realize that he had no friends ."
"He lived by himself , he would come in for chemotherapy by himself , he would receive his treatment , and then he &apos;d walk home alone ."
"And I even asked him . I said , &quot; &quot; Hey , how come you never bring a friend with you ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really have any friends . &quot; &quot; But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor ."
"We all loved him , and people were going in and out of his room all the time ."
"So at his last chemo , we sang him the song and we put the crown on his head and we blew the bubbles , and then I asked him , I said , &quot; So what are you going to do now ? &quot;"
"And he answered , &quot; Make friends . &quot;"
And he did .
"He started volunteering and he made friends there , and he began going to a church and he made friends there , and at Christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment , and the place was filled with his friends ."
Claim your experience .
Don &apos;t let it claim you .
So what about you ?
How are you going to find meaning in your crappy experience ?
"It could be a recent one , or it could be one that you &apos;ve been carrying around for a really long time ."
"It &apos;s never too late to change what it means , because meaning is dynamic ."
"What it means today may not be what it means a year from now , or 10 years from now ."
It &apos;s never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor .
Hear how static that word sounds ?
Survivor .
"No movement , no growth ."
Claim your experience .
"Don &apos;t let it claim you , because if you do , I believe you will become trapped , you will not grow , you will not evolve ."
"But of course , sometimes it &apos;s not outside pressures that cause us to take on that identity of survivor ."
Sometimes we just like the perks .
Sometimes there &apos;s a payoff .
But then we get stuck .
"Now , one of the first things I learned as a chaplain intern was the three C &apos;s of the chaplain &apos;s job : Comfort , clarify and , when necessary , confront or challenge ."
"Now , we all pretty much love the comforting and the clarifying ."
"The confronting , not so much ."
"One of the other things that I loved about being a chaplain was seeing patients a year , or even several years after their treatment , because it was just really cool to see how they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them ."
"So I was thrilled one day to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic from a patient who I had seen the year before , and she was there with her two adult daughters , who I also knew , for her one year follow-up exam ."
"So I got down to the lobby , and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was NED : No Evidence of Disease ."
Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead .
"So they were ecstatic , we sat down to visit , and it was so weird , because within two minutes , she started retelling me the story of her diagnosis and her surgery and her chemo , even though , as her chaplain , I saw her every week , and so I knew this story ."
"And she was using words like suffering , agony , struggle ."
"And she ended her story with , &quot; I felt crucified . &quot;"
"And at that point , her two daughters got up and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go get coffee . &quot;"
And they left .
Tell me three things about yourself before the next stop .
People were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three .
"So I handed her a tissue , and I gave her a hug , and then , because I really cared for this woman , I said , &quot; Get down off your cross . &quot;"
"And she said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I repeated , &quot; &quot; Get down off your cross . &quot; &quot; And to her credit , she could talk about her reasons for embracing and then clinging to this identity ."
It got her a lot of attention .
People were taking care of her for a change .
"But now , it was having the opposite effect ."
It was pushing people away .
People kept leaving to get coffee .
"She felt crucified by her experience , but she didn &apos;t want to let that crucified self die ."
"Now , perhaps you are thinking I was a little harsh with her , so I must tell you that I was speaking out of my own experience ."
"Many , many years before , I had been fired from a job that I loved , and I would not stop talking about my innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt , until finally , just like this woman , people were walking away from me , until I finally realized I wasn &apos;t just processing my feelings , I was feeding them ."
I didn &apos;t want to let that crucified self die .
"But we all know that with any resurrection story , you have to die first ."
"The Christian story , Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb before he was resurrected ."
"And I believe that for us , being in the tomb means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds and allowing ourselves to be healed ."
"We have to let that crucified self die so that a new self , a truer self , is born ."
"We have to let that old story go so that a new story , a truer story , can be told ."
Claim your experience . Don &apos;t let it claim you .
"What if there were no survivors , meaning , what if people decided to just claim their trauma as an experience instead of taking it on as an identity ?"
Maybe it would be the end of being trapped in our wounds and the beginning of amazing self-exploration and discovery and growth .
Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become and who we are becoming .
So perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me .
No matter .
"I just want you all to know that I am really glad that we are on this bus together , and this is my stop ."
( Applause )
"YouTube , they &apos;re putting this thing on YouTube ."
Why did you bring this up ?
( Applause )
"Well , I &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics ."
"In fact , mostly now in other things ."
One thing is distant relationships among human languages .
"And the professional , historical linguists in the U.S."
"and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships , big groupings , groupings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families ."
They don &apos;t like that . They think it &apos;s crank . I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank .
"And there are some brilliant linguists , mostly Russians , who are working on that , at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow , and I would love to see where that leads ."
"Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20 , 25,000 years ago ?"
"And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ?"
How far back does that go ? How far back does modern language go ?
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
Chris Anderson : Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is ?
"Murray Gell-Mann : Well , I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe , in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago , or earlier ."
I can &apos;t believe they did all those things and didn &apos;t also have a modern language .
"So , I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further ."
"But that doesn &apos;t mean that all , or many , or most of today &apos;s attested languages couldn &apos;t descend perhaps from one that &apos;s much younger than that , like say 20,000 years , or something of that kind . It &apos;s what we call a bottleneck ."
"CA : Well , Philip Anderson may have been right ."
You may just know more about everything than anyone .
"So , it &apos;s been an honor . Thank you Murray Gell-Mann ."

What &apos;s happening to the climate ?
"This is , obviously , that famous view now of the Arctic , which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years . Very , very , very scary ."
So we all look at what we can do .
"And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2 , 52 percent are tied to buildings ."
"Only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough ."
So we ran off to a sushi bar .
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea .
And it was something called EcoRock .
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year .
"So it was a big idea . We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent , which is exactly what we &apos;ve done ."
We started R &amp; D in 2006 .
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
There is the inside of our lab . We haven &apos;t shown this before .
"But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets ."
"And they worked absolutely very , very , very hard ."
So then we went forward and built our production line in China .
"We don &apos;t build this production equipment any longer in the U.S. , unfortunately ."
We did the line install over the summer .
"We started right there , with absolutely nothing ."
"You &apos;re seeing for the first time , a brand new drywall production line , not made using gypsum at all ."
That &apos;s the finished production line there .
We got our first panel out on December third .
"That is the slurry being poured onto paper , basically . That &apos;s the line running ."
"The exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people ."
These are people who worked this project for two to three years .
And they are so excited . That &apos;s the first board off the line .
"Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board . Obviously very , very excited ."
"But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment ."
"We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world ."
And we &apos;ve got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing .
"We happened to win , just recently , the Green Product of the Year for &quot; &quot; The Re-Invention of Drywall , &quot; &quot; from Popular Science ."
Thank you . Thank you .
"So here is what we learned : 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house ."
You probably had no idea . It &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
We must change everything .
"Look around the room : chairs , wood , everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to lick this problem ."
"Don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do this , because anyone can ."
"And these job losses , we can fix them with green-collar jobs ."
We &apos;ve got four plants . We &apos;re building this stuff around the country .
We &apos;re going as fast as we can .
"Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum , you know , CO2 generated . Right ?"
So what will you do ? I &apos;ll tell you what I did and why I did it . And I know my time &apos;s up .
"Those are my kids , Natalie and David ."
"When they have their kids , 2050 , they &apos;d better look back at Grandpa and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , you gave it a good shot . You did the best you could with the team that you had . &quot; &quot; So my hope is that when you leave TED , you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it ."
"And if you don &apos;t know how , please find me — I will help you ."
"Last but not least , Bill Gates , I know you invented Windows ."
"Wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we &apos;ve invented ."
Thank you so much .

"There is something you know about me , something very personal , and there is something I know about every one of you and that &apos;s very central to your concerns ."
And that is that all of us want to be happy .
"In this , we are all together ."
Now my topic is gratefulness .
What is the connection between happiness and gratefulness ?
"Many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy ."
"When you are happy , you are grateful ."
But think again .
Is it really the happy people that are grateful ?
"And we all know people who have lots of misfortune , misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have , and they are deeply happy ."
They radiate happiness . You are surprised .
Why ? Because they are grateful .
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes us happy .
"If you think it &apos;s happiness that makes you grateful , think again ."
"Now , we can ask , what do we really mean by gratefulness ?"
And how does it work ?
I appeal to your own experience .
We all know from experience how it goes .
We experience something that &apos;s valuable to us .
Something is given to us that &apos;s valuable to us .
And it &apos;s really given .
These two things have to come together .
"It has to be something valuable , and it &apos;s a real gift ."
You haven &apos;t bought it . You haven &apos;t earned it .
You haven &apos;t traded it in . You haven &apos;t worked for it .
It &apos;s just given to you .
That &apos;s how gratefulness happens .
Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while .
We cannot only have grateful experiences .
We can be people who live gratefully .
"Grateful living , that is the thing ."
And how can we live gratefully ?
"By experiencing , by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment , as we say ."
It &apos;s a gift . You haven &apos;t earned it .
You haven &apos;t brought it about in any way .
"You have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you , and yet , that &apos;s the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us , this moment , with all the opportunity that it contains ."
"It &apos;s a given moment , as we say ."
"Now , we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity ."
"What you are really grateful for is the opportunity , not the thing that is given to you , because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn &apos;t have the opportunity to enjoy it , to do something with it , you wouldn &apos;t be grateful for it ."
"Opportunity is the gift within every gift , and we have this saying , opportunity knocks only once ."
"Well , think again ."
"Every moment is a new gift , over and over again , and if you miss the opportunity of this moment , another moment is given to us , and another moment ."
"We can avail ourselves of this opportunity , or we can miss it , and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity , it is the key to happiness ."
Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands .
"Moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift ."
Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
Certainly not .
But I didn &apos;t say we can be grateful for everything .
It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
"Actually , when you look at it and experience it , you find that most of the time , what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy , and we only miss it because we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity ."
"But once in a while , something very difficult is given to us , and when this difficult thing occurs to us , it &apos;s a challenge to rise to that opportunity , and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful ."
"Learning patience , for instance ."
"We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint , but is more like a marathon ."
That takes patience . That &apos;s difficult .
"It may be to stand up for your opinion , to stand up for your conviction ."
That &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
"To learn , to suffer , to stand up , all these opportunities are given to us , but they are opportunities , and those who avail themselves of those opportunities are the ones that we admire ."
They make something out of life .
And those who fail get another opportunity .
That &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
So how can we find a method that will harness this ?
"How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully , not just once in a while being grateful , but moment by moment to be grateful ."
How can we do it ? It &apos;s a very simple method .
Stop .
Look .
Go .
That &apos;s all .
But how often do we stop ?
We rush through life . We don &apos;t stop .
We miss the opportunity because we don &apos;t stop .
We have to stop .
We have to get quiet .
And we have to build stop signs into our lives .
"When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back , I noticed water ."
"In Africa where I was , I didn &apos;t have drinkable water ."
"Every time I turned on the faucet , I was overwhelmed ."
"Every time I clicked on the light , I was so grateful ."
It made me so happy .
So leave it up to your own imagination .
"And when you stop , then the next thing is to look ."
You look . You open your eyes .
You open your ears . You open your nose .
You open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us .
"There is no end to it , and that is what life is all about , to enjoy , to enjoy what is given to us ."
"And then we can also open our hearts , our hearts for the opportunities , for the opportunities also to help others , to make others happy , because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy ."
"And when we open our hearts to the opportunities , the opportunities invite us to do something , and that is the third ."
"Stop , look , and then go , and really do something ."
And what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment .
"Mostly it &apos;s the opportunity to enjoy , but sometimes it &apos;s something more difficult ."
"But whatever it is , if we take this opportunity , we go with it , we are creative , those are the creative people ."
"And that little stop , look , go , is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world ."
"Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness , and you will be surprised if you — I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word &quot; &quot; gratefulness &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; gratitude &quot; &quot; comes up ."
"It can change our world in immensely important ways , because if you &apos;re grateful , you &apos;re not fearful , and if you &apos;re not fearful , you &apos;re not violent ."
"If you &apos;re grateful , you act out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity , and you are willing to share ."
"If you are grateful , you are enjoying the differences between people , and you are respectful to everybody , and that changes this power pyramid under which we live ."
"And it doesn &apos;t make for equality , but it makes for equal respect , and that is the important thing ."
"The future of the world will be a network , not a pyramid turned upside down ."
"The revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution , and it &apos;s so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes the very concept of a revolution , because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those who were on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before ."
"What we need is a networking of smaller groups , smaller and smaller groups who know one another , who interact with one another , and that is a grateful world ."
A grateful world is a world of joyful people .
"Grateful people are joyful people , and joyful people — the more and more joyful people there are , the more and more we &apos;ll have a joyful world ."
"We have a network for grateful living , and it has mushroomed ."
We couldn &apos;t understand why it mushroomed .
We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something .
And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade .
"People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world , and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop , look , go , to transform the world , to make it a happy place ."
Thank you .

"In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar ."
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
"But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims ."
"When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail ."
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world &apos;s populous faces : not having detailed maps .
But help was coming .
"At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points ."
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
"People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store ."
Maps matter .
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
"For example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone ."
"In the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable ."
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .
Let &apos;s look at some of the maps being created by users right now .
"So , as we speak , people are mapping the world in these 170 countries ."
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal .
"And , closer to home , Chalua , an N.G. road in Bangalore ."
"This is the result of computational geometry , gesture recognition , and machine learning ."
"This is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time ."
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet .
Welcome to the new world .

"A great way to start , I think , with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED . Here you are , understanding why we &apos;re here , what &apos;s going on with no difficulty at all ."
"The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing , and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point ."
( Laughter ) He would have a great time .
"And of course , if you &apos;re a speaker here , like Hans Rosling , a speaker finds this complex , tricky . But in Hans Rosling &apos;s case , he had a secret weapon yesterday , literally , in his sword swallowing act ."
"And I must say , I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on , but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing ."
"So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense , but that we &apos;re easily fooled . In fact , what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled , so we &apos;re actually looking forward to it ."
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
"And this makes many things fun , but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves ."
"And our friend , Betty Edwards , the &quot; &quot; Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain &quot; &quot; lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says , &quot; &quot; The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can &apos;t move your hand , but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty ."
"It &apos;s trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what &apos;s there . &quot; &quot; And to prove it , she says , &quot; &quot; The exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same , and I &apos;m going to prove it to you . &quot; &quot; She does this with cardboard , but since I have an expensive computer here I &apos;ll just rotate this little guy around and ..."
"Now having seen that — and I &apos;ve seen it hundreds of times , because I use this in every talk I give — I still can &apos;t see that they &apos;re the same size and shape , and I doubt that you can either ."
"So what do artists do ? Well , what artists do is to measure ."
"They measure very , very carefully ."
"And if you measure very , very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge , you &apos;ll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size ."
"And the Talmud saw this a long time ago , saying , &quot; We see things not as they are , but as we are . &quot;"
"I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then , if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion ."
"So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are , then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here . It &apos;s a waking dream , and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history ."
"And what that means : &quot; &quot; simple and understandable &quot; &quot; might not be actually simple or understandable , and things we think are &quot; &quot; complex &quot; &quot; might be made simple and understandable ."
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws .
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel .
"The way I think of it is , we can &apos;t learn to see until we admit we &apos;re blind ."
"Once you start down at this very humble level , then you can start finding ways to see things ."
"And what &apos;s happened , over the last 400 years in particular , is that human beings have invented &quot; &quot; brainlets &quot; &quot; — little additional parts for our brain — made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways ."
"And these are in the form of sensory apparatus — telescopes , microscopes — reasoning apparatus — various ways of thinking — and , most importantly , in the ability to change perspective on things ."
I &apos;ll talk about that a little bit .
It &apos;s this change in perspective on what it is we think we &apos;re perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history .
"And yet , it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I &apos;m aware of ."
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more . We like more .
"If we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time ."
"But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties ; another name for them could be &quot; &quot; architecture &quot; &quot; as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non-obvious , non-simple ways of combining it ."
"And in fact , what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature — of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar — all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish , and they &apos;re in violent motion ."
Those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world .
But how simple ?
"So , when I saw Roslings &apos; Gapminder stuff a few years ago , I just thought it was the greatest thing I &apos;d seen in conveying complex ideas simply ."
"But then I had a thought of , &quot; &quot; Boy , maybe it &apos;s too simple . &quot; &quot; And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side , and I found that they matched up very well ."
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what &apos;s important about the data .
"Whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biologist , I didn &apos;t like that at all ."
"Not because it wasn &apos;t beautiful or anything , but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology , and that is : why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed ?"
"And what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous ; they just swooped in the air and bound , and something happened ."
"But in fact , those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second ; they &apos;re agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds ; they &apos;re completely crowded together , they &apos;re jammed , they &apos;re bashing up against each other ."
"And if you don &apos;t understand that in your mental model of this stuff , what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous , and I think that &apos;s exactly the wrong image for when you &apos;re trying to teach science ."
"So , another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle ."
"So a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics ."
"So a more direct one , one that gives you more of the feeling of math , is something closer to Pythagoras &apos; own proof , which goes like this : so here we have this triangle , and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that , notice that we can move those triangles down like this ."
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo . That is all you have to do .
"And this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you &apos;re learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the , literally , 1,200 or 1,500 proofs of Pythagoras &apos; theorem that have been discovered ."
Now let &apos;s go to young children .
"This is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher , but was a natural mathematician ."
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician ; she just had a feeling for math .
"And here are her six-year-olds , and she &apos;s got them making shapes out of a shape ."
"So they pick a shape they like — like a diamond , or a square , or a triangle , or a trapezoid — and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape , and the next larger shape ."
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there .
"And what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science ."
So they had created these artifacts .
"Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious , which I thought for a long time , until she explained to me was to slow them down so they &apos;ll think ."
So they &apos;re cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up .
But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out .
&quot; What have you noticed about what you did ? &quot;
"And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one , and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one , the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one , and then the next one ."
"She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two , so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there ."
"And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six , where she wasn &apos;t sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was , but then she was confident again ."
So that &apos;s what Lauren did .
"And then the teacher , Gillian Ishijima , had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor , and everybody went batshit : &quot; &quot; Holy shit ! They &apos;re the same ! &quot; &quot; No matter what the shapes were , the growth law is the same ."
"And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation , derived by six-year-olds ."
"Well , that &apos;s pretty amazing ."
That isn &apos;t what we usually try to teach six-year-olds .
"So , let &apos;s take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this ."
And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do .
I &apos;m using the software that we &apos;re putting on the $ 100 laptop .
So I &apos;d like to draw a little car here — I &apos;ll just do this very quickly — and put a big tire on him .
"And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object , I &apos;ll call it a car . And here &apos;s a little behavior : car forward ."
"Each time I click it , car turn ."
"If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again , I just drag these guys out and set them going ."
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here ?
So what if I click this down to zero ?
It goes straight . That &apos;s a big revelation for nine-year-olds .
Make it go in the other direction .
"But of course , that &apos;s a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car , so the kids want to do a steering wheel ; so they draw a steering wheel ."
And we &apos;ll call this a wheel .
See this wheel &apos;s heading here ?
"If I turn this wheel , you can see that number over there going minus and positive ."
"That &apos;s kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here , and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel ."
And it &apos;s interesting .
"You know how much trouble the children have with variables , but by learning it this way , in a situated fashion , they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it ."
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did .
"So if you look at the little script here , the speed is always going to be 30 ."
We &apos;re going to move the car according to that over and over again .
And I &apos;m dropping a little dot for each one of these things ; they &apos;re evenly spaced because they &apos;re 30 apart .
"And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did of saying , &quot; &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to increase the speed by two each time , and then I &apos;m going to increase the distance by the speed each time ?"
What do I get there ? &quot; &quot; We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
So how do the children do science ?
( Video ) Teacher : &#91; Choose &#93; objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time .
"Student 1 : Ooh , this is nice ."
Teacher : Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing .
Who &apos;s got the apple ?
Alan Kay : They &apos;ve got little stopwatches .
Student 2 : What did you get ? What did you get ?
AK : Stopwatches aren &apos;t accurate enough .
Student 3 : 0.99 seconds .
Teacher : So put &quot; &quot; sponge ball &quot; &quot; ...
"Student 4l : &#91; I decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sponge ball because they &apos;re two totally different weights , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed ."
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa !
"AK : So obviously , Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because , of course , he didn &apos;t bother doing the experiment , and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas ."
"And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child , only 400 years ago ."
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .
"Now , what if we want to look at this more closely ?"
"We can take a movie of what &apos;s going on , but even if we single stepped this movie , it &apos;s tricky to see what &apos;s going on ."
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up .
"So when the children see this , they say , &quot; &quot; Ah ! Acceleration , &quot; &quot; remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways , and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is ."
"So what I &apos;m doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fifth of a second later , like that . And they &apos;re getting faster and faster each time , and if I stack these guys up , then we see the differences ; the increase in the speed is constant ."
"And they say , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah . Constant acceleration ."
We &apos;ve done that already . &quot; &quot; And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it ?
"So you can &apos;t tell much from just making the ball drop there , but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time , we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model ."
"Galileo , by the way , did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute ."
"I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story , but it &apos;s a great story ."
And I thought I would do just one thing on the $ 100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here .
"So once you have gravity , here &apos;s this — increase the speed by something , increase the ship &apos;s speed ."
"If I start the little game here that the kids have done , it &apos;ll crash the space ship ."
"But if I oppose gravity , here we go ... Oops !"
( Laughter ) One more .
"Yeah , there we go . Yeah , OK ?"
"I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes : Marshall McLuhan said , &quot; Children are the messages that we send to the future , &quot; but in fact , if you think of it , children are the future we send to the future ."
"Forget about messages ; children are the future , and children in the first and second world and , most especially , in the third world need mentors ."
"And this summer , we &apos;re going to build five million of these $ 100 laptops , and maybe 50 million next year ."
"But we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life ."
"That means that we , once again , have a thing where we can put technology out , but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing ."
"I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface , and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars ."
"It sounds like a lot , but it is literally 18 minutes of what we &apos;re spending in Iraq — we &apos;re spending 8 billion dollars a month ; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars — so this is actually cheap ."
"And Einstein said , &quot; Things should be as simple as possible , but not simpler . &quot;"
Thank you .
The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass-stained cathedral .
"I was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet , dip both hands into holy water , trace the trinity across my chest , my tiny body drooping like a question mark all over the wooden pew ."
"I asked Jesus to fix me , and when he did not answer I befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue , but shame lingered as an aftertaste ."
"And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity , my mother told me of the miracle I was , said I could grow up to be anything I want ."
I decided to be a boy .
It was cute .
"I had snapback , toothless grin , used skinned knees as street cred , played hide and seek with what was left of my goal ."
I was it .
"The winner to a game the other kids couldn &apos;t play , I was the mystery of an anatomy , a question asked but not answered , tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl , and when I turned 12 , the boy phase wasn &apos;t deemed cute anymore ."
"It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts , who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home , that I exist for heterosexual marriage and child-bearing ."
And I swallowed their insults along with their slurs .
"Naturally , I did not come out of the closet ."
The kids at my school opened it without my permission .
"Called me by a name I did not recognize , said &quot; &quot; lesbian , &quot; &quot; but I was more boy than girl , more Ken than Barbie ."
"It had nothing to do with hating my body , I just love it enough to let it go , I treat it like a house , and when your house is falling apart , you do not evacuate , you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides , you make it pretty enough to invite guests over , you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on ."
My mother fears I have named myself after fading things .
"As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall , Leelah Alcorn , Blake Brockington ."
"She fears that I &apos;ll die without a whisper , that I &apos;ll turn into &quot; &quot; what a shame &quot; &quot; conversations at the bus stop ."
"She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum , that I am a walking casket , news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle , Bruce Jenner on everyone &apos;s lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages ."
"No one ever thinks of us as human because we are more ghost than flesh , because people fear that my gender expression is a trick , that it exists to be perverse , that it ensnares them without their consent , that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer , they &apos;ll regurgitate all the parts they did not like ."
"They &apos;ll put me back into the closet , hang me with all the other skeletons ."
I will be the best attraction .
"Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins , to misspell their names on gravestones ."
"And people still wonder why there are boys rotting , they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents ."
"I wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant , before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin way before we learn how to love them ."
"Like God didn &apos;t save all this breath and mercy , like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus &apos; feet ."
My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat .
"Maybe I am finally fixed , maybe I just don &apos;t care , maybe God finally listened to my prayers ."
Thank you .

I &apos;m a designer and an educator .
"I &apos;m a multitasking person , and I push my students to fly through a very creative , multitasking design process ."
"But how efficient is , really , this multitasking ?"
Let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
A couple of examples .
Look at that .
"This is my multitasking activity result . ( Laughter ) So trying to cook , answering the phone , writing SMS , and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue ."
"So someone tells us the story about supertaskers , so this two percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment ."
"But what about ourselves , and what about our reality ?"
When &apos;s the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend ?
"So this is a project I &apos;m working on , and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super , hyper — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) to downgrade our super , hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function ."
Another example : Have you ever been to Venice ?
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island .
"But our multitasking reality is pretty different , and full of tons of information ."
So what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure ?
"I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge , but I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task , or maybe turning your digital senses totally off ."
"So nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product ."
Why not ? So find your monotask spot within the multitasking world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Even if I did little , sales would be OK ."
"Yes , it may be hard to find talent ."
So why do we learn mathematics ?
"Essentially , for three reasons : calculation , application , and last , and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it , inspiration ."
"Mathematics is the science of patterns , and we study it to learn how to think logically , critically and creatively , but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated , and when our students ask , &quot; Why are we learning this ? &quot;"
then they often hear that they &apos;ll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test .
But wouldn &apos;t it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind ?
"Now , I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen , so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers , the Fibonacci numbers . ( Applause ) Yeah ! I already have Fibonacci fans here ."
That &apos;s great .
Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
"From the standpoint of calculation , they &apos;re as easy to understand as one plus one , which is two ."
"Then one plus two is three , two plus three is five , three plus five is eight , and so on ."
"Indeed , the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa , and these numbers appear in his book &quot; &quot; Liber Abaci , &quot; &quot; which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today ."
"In terms of applications , Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often ."
"The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number , or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well ."
"In fact , there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers , but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display ."
Let me show you one of my favorites .
"Suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ? ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers ."
"So one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on ."
"Now , it &apos;s no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers , you get the next Fibonacci number . Right ?"
That &apos;s how they &apos;re created .
But you wouldn &apos;t expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together .
But check this out .
"One plus one gives us two , and one plus four gives us five ."
"And four plus nine is 13 , nine plus 25 is 34 , and yes , the pattern continues ."
"In fact , here &apos;s another one ."
Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers .
Let &apos;s see what we get there .
So one plus one plus four is six .
"Add nine to that , we get 15 ."
"Add 25 , we get 40 ."
"Add 64 , we get 104 ."
Now look at those numbers .
"Those are not Fibonacci numbers , but if you look at them closely , you &apos;ll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them ."
Do you see it ? I &apos;ll show it to you .
"Six is two times three , 15 is three times five , 40 is five times eight , two , three , five , eight , who do we appreciate ?"
( Laughter ) Fibonacci ! Of course .
"Now , as much fun as it is to discover these patterns , it &apos;s even more satisfying to understand why they are true ."
Let &apos;s look at that last equation .
"Why should the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 ?"
I &apos;ll show you by drawing a simple picture .
We &apos;ll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square .
"Together , they form a one-by-two rectangle ."
"Beneath that , I &apos;ll put a two-by-two square , and next to that , a three-by-three square , beneath that , a five-by-five square , and then an eight-by-eight square , creating one giant rectangle , right ?"
Now let me ask you a simple question : what is the area of the rectangle ?
"Well , on the one hand , it &apos;s the sum of the areas of the squares inside it , right ?"
Just as we created it .
It &apos;s one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared . Right ?
That &apos;s the area .
"On the other hand , because it &apos;s a rectangle , the area is equal to its height times its base , and the height is clearly eight , and the base is five plus eight , which is the next Fibonacci number , 13 . Right ?"
So the area is also eight times 13 .
"Since we &apos;ve correctly calculated the area two different ways , they have to be the same number , and that &apos;s why the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 ."
"Now , if we continue this process , we &apos;ll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21 , 21 by 34 , and so on ."
Now check this out .
"If you divide 13 by eight , you get 1.625 ."
"And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number , then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618 , known to many people as the Golden Ratio , a number which has fascinated mathematicians , scientists and artists for centuries ."
"Now , I show all this to you because , like so much of mathematics , there &apos;s a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools ."
"We spend lots of time learning about calculation , but let &apos;s not forget about application , including , perhaps , the most important application of all , learning how to think ."
"If I could summarize this in one sentence , it would be this : Mathematics is not just solving for x , it &apos;s also figuring out why ."
Thank you very much .

"( Applause ) AIDS was discovered 1981 ; the virus , 1983 ."
"These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world , or how we estimate that it was ."
"What we are showing here is — on this axis here , I &apos;m showing percent of infected adults ."
"And on this axis , I &apos;m showing dollars per person in income ."
"And the size of these bubbles , the size of the bubbles here , that shows how many are infected in each country , and the color is the continent ."
"Now , you can see United States , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble ."
There were quite many people infected in the United States .
"And , up there , you see Uganda ."
"They had almost five percent infected , and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country , then ."
And they were probably the most infected country in the world .
"Now , what has happened ?"
"Now you have understood the graph and now , in the next 60 seconds , we will play the HIV epidemic in the world ."
"But first , I have a new invention here ."
( Laughter ) I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer . ( Laughter )
"( Applause ) So , ready , steady , go !"
"First , we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe ."
They went upwards like this .
"In Asia , the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand — they reached one to two percent ."
"Then , Uganda started to turn back , whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed , and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency ."
"Look , India got many infected , but had a low level ."
And almost the same happens here .
"See , Uganda coming down , Zimbabwe coming down , Russia went to one percent ."
"In the last two to three years , we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world ."
25 years it took .
"But , steady state doesn &apos;t mean that things are getting better , it &apos;s just that they have stopped getting worse ."
"And it has — the steady state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected ."
"It means 30 to 40 million people , the whole of California — every person , that &apos;s more or less what we have today in the world ."
"Now , let me make a fast replay of Botswana ."
"Botswana — upper middle-income country in southern Africa , democratic government , good economy , and this is what happened there ."
"They started low , they skyrocketed , they peaked up there in 2003 , and now they are down ."
"But they are falling only slowly , because in Botswana , with good economy and governance , they can manage to treat people ."
"And if people who are infected are treated , they don &apos;t die of AIDS ."
These percentages won &apos;t come down because people can survive 10 to 20 years .
So there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
"But the poorer countries in Africa , the low-income countries down here , there the rates fall faster , of the percentage infected , because people still die ."
"In spite of PEPFAR , the generous PEPFAR , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years ."
It &apos;s not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries .
But it &apos;s very good that what is done is being done .
But focus now is back on prevention .
It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it .
"Drugs is too costly — had we had the vaccine , or when we will get the vaccine , that &apos;s something more effective — but the drugs are very costly for the poor ."
"Not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it ."
"So , when we look at the pattern , one thing comes out very clearly : you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa ."
"I would say , HIV is very different in Africa ."
"You &apos;ll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries , and yet you &apos;ll find Senegal , down here — the same rate as United States ."
"And you &apos;ll find Madagascar , and you &apos;ll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world ."
It &apos;s this terrible simplification that there &apos;s one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa .
We have to stop that .
"It &apos;s not respectful , and it &apos;s not very clever to think that way ."
( Applause ) I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States .
I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different .
( Laughter ) And so it is in Africa — it &apos;s a lot of difference .
"So , why is it so high ? Is it war ?"
"No , it &apos;s not . Look here ."
"War-torn Congo is down there — two , three , four percent ."
"And this is peaceful Zambia , neighboring country — 15 percent ."
"And there &apos;s good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo — they have two , three percent infected , and peaceful Zambia — much higher ."
"There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible , that rapes are terrible , but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa ."
"So , is it poverty ?"
"Well if you look at the macro level , it seems more money , more HIV ."
"But that &apos;s very simplistic , so let &apos;s go down and look at Tanzania ."
"I will split Tanzania in five income groups , from the highest income to the lowest income , and here we go ."
"The ones with the highest income , the better off — I wouldn &apos;t say rich — they have higher HIV ."
"The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent , and it is even bigger among women ."
"There &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case ."
"So , this is the difference within Tanzania ."
"And , I can &apos;t avoid showing Kenya ."
Look here at Kenya .
I &apos;ve split Kenya in its provinces .
Here it goes .
"See the difference within one African country — it goes from very low level to very high level , and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest ."
"So , what is it then ?"
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries ?
"Well , it is more common with multiple partners , there is less condom use , and there is age-disparate sex — that is , older men tend to have sex with younger women ."
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries .
But where are they situated ?
I will swap the bubbles to a map .
"Look , the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected ."
HIV exists all over the world .
"Look , you have bubbles all over the world here ."
Brazil has many HIV-infected .
"Arab countries not so much , but Iran is quite high ."
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran .
India has many because they are many .
"Southeast Asia , and so on ."
"But , there is one part of Africa — and the difficult thing is , at the same time , not to make a uniform statement about Africa , not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this , on one hand ."
"On the other hand , try to say that this is not the case , because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now ."
"UNAIDS have done good data available , finally , about the spread of HIV ."
It could be concurrency .
It could be some virus types .
It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency .
"After all , if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex , the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000 ."
Don &apos;t jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on .
"( Laughter ) But — and if you are in an unfavorable situation , more sexually transmitted diseases , it can be one in 100 ."
But what we think is that it could be concurrency .
And what is concurrency ?
"In Sweden , we have no concurrency ."
We have serial monogamy .
"Vodka , New Year &apos;s Eve — new partner for the spring ."
"Vodka , Midsummer &apos;s Eve — new partner for the fall ."
"Vodka — and it goes on like this , you know ?"
And you collect a big number of exes .
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic — terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years .
"HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore , having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others ."
"Probably , it &apos;s a combination of this ."
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this .
"You can get this chart , free ."
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site .
"And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart , we will not only have the money , but we will also use the brain ."
Thank you very much .

"This is a work in process , based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine ."
"( Music ) ( Video ) Narrator : On this planet , 1.6 billion people don &apos;t have access to electricity , refrigeration or stored fuels ."
This is a problem .
"It impacts : the spread of disease , the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life ."
"So here &apos;s the plan : inexpensive refrigeration that doesn &apos;t use electricity , propane , gas , kerosene or consumables ."
Time for some thermodynamics .
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator .
"Adam Grosser : So 29 years ago , I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration ."
It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
"It was a lot like the Stirling engine : it was cool , but you didn &apos;t know what to do with it ."
"And it was invented in 1858 , by this guy Ferdinand Carre , but he couldn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time ."
"This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928 , and it was a really neat idea , and I &apos;ll get to why it didn &apos;t work , but here &apos;s how it works ."
There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
"One has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser ."
"You heat up one side , the hot side ."
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
"You let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect ."
"So , it was a great idea that didn &apos;t work at all : it blew up ."
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
It topped 400 psi . The ammonia was toxic . It sprayed everywhere .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
"So , the great thing about 2006 is there &apos;s a lot of really great computational work you can do ."
"So , we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved — a lot of computational fluid dynamics ."
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures .
"Brought in a team from the U.K. — there &apos;s a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the U.K. — and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator ."
"So , this is the way it works ."
You put it on a cooking fire .
"Most people have cooking fires in the world , whether it &apos;s camel dung or wood ."
"It heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour ."
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
"However , largely to our surprise , they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state ."
"It turned out that the capability to collect data , information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we &apos;ve been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies , mostly U.S. intelligence agencies , watching over the rest of the world ."
We &apos;ve heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6 .
"Edward Snowden started leaking information , top secret classified information , from the U.S. intelligence agencies , and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others ."
"And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now , against the whole rest of the world ."
"And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell , well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist ."
( Laughter ) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah .
"Due to be opened very soon , it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center ."
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
"How big ? Well , I can give you the numbers — 140,000 square meters — but that doesn &apos;t really tell you very much ."
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
You think about the largest IKEA store you &apos;ve ever been in .
This is five times larger .
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store ?
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year .
"And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever , keep it for extended periods of time , keep it for years , keep it for decades ."
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all .
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone .
"Well , not exactly everyone , because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners ."
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners &apos; data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States .
And monitoring foreigners doesn &apos;t sound too bad until you realize that I &apos;m a foreigner and you &apos;re a foreigner .
"In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners ."
( Laughter ) Right ?
"So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us , all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet ."
But don &apos;t get me wrong : There are actually types of surveillance that are okay .
"I love freedom , but even I agree that some surveillance is fine ."
"If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer , or they &apos;re trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting , and they have leads and they have suspects , then it &apos;s perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect &apos;s phone , and to intercept his Internet communications ."
"I &apos;m not arguing that at all , but that &apos;s not what programs like PRISM are about ."
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings .
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
"So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this , well , the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations , there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations , saying that we knew all this already , we knew it was happening , there &apos;s nothing new here ."
"And that &apos;s not true . Don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already ."
"Our worst fears might have been something like this , but we didn &apos;t know this was happening ."
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about this . We didn &apos;t know about PRISM .
We didn &apos;t know about XKeyscore . We didn &apos;t know about Cybertrans .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
We did not know about Skywriter — all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies .
But now we do .
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
"And what that means is that you take something which is secure , an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file , nobody can decrypt that file ."
"Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file , it &apos;s going to take millions of years ."
"So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable ."
"You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose , making all of us less secure as an end result ."
"A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because , you know , bad people might have house alarms , but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result ."
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
"But of course , these intelligence agencies are doing their job ."
"This is what they have been told to do : do signals intelligence , monitor telecommunications , monitor Internet traffic ."
"That &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do , and since most , a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted , they &apos;re trying to find ways around the encryption ."
"One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms , which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose ."
"They are completely out of control , and they should be brought back under control ."
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden .
"The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers , and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to ."
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
"So for example , they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11 , 2007 , for Yahoo on the March 12 , 2008 , and then others : Google , Facebook , Skype , Apple and so on ."
And every single one of these companies denies .
"They all say that this simply isn &apos;t true , that they are not giving backdoor access to their data ."
Yet we have these files .
"So is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?"
"And one explanation would be that these parties , these service providers , are not cooperating ."
"Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked ."
That would explain it . They aren &apos;t cooperating . They &apos;ve been hacked .
"In this case , they &apos;ve been hacked by their own government ."
"That might sound outlandish , but we already have cases where this has happened , for example , the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government , and which , to spread , subverted the security of the Windows Update network , meaning here , the company was hacked by their own government ."
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
"Der Spiegel , from Germany , leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies ."
"Inside NSA , the unit is called TAO , Tailored Access Operations , and inside GCHQ , which is the U.K. equivalent , it &apos;s called NAC , Network Analysis Centre ."
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium .
"And what this really means is that an E.U. country &apos;s intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose , and they discuss it in their slides completely casually , business as usual ."
"Here &apos;s the primary target , here &apos;s the secondary target , here &apos;s the teaming ."
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub .
"They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like , you know , &quot; &quot; Success , &quot; &quot; when they gain access to services like this ."
What the hell ?
"And then there &apos;s the argument that okay , yes , this might be going on , but then again , other countries are doing it as well ."
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
"Many countries spy , not all of them , but let &apos;s take an example ."
"Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden ."
I &apos;m speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States .
"When your data traffic goes through Sweden , their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic ."
"All right , how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , U.S.-based services , like , you know , run Windows or OSX , or use Facebook or LinkedIn , or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox , or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support ?"
"And the answer is , every single Swedish business leader does that every single day ."
And then we turn it around .
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services ?
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
"It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close ."
"And when we do have the occasional European success story , even those , then , typically end up being sold to the United States ."
"Like , Skype used to be secure ."
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
"Today , it no longer is secure ."
"So once again , we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose , making all of us less secure as an outcome ."
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
"Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror ."
"Yes , part of it is war on terror , and yes , there are terrorists , and they do kill and maim , and we should fight them , but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders , to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil , to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament , and I don &apos;t think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament , right ?"
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
"Part of it might be , and there are terrorists , but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them ?"
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists ?
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom ?
"Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat , we are ready to do anything at all ?"
"But people are scared about terrorists , and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide ."
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
"( Applause ) Because we have this thing called privacy , and if you really think that you have nothing to hide , please make sure that &apos;s the first thing you tell me , because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets , because obviously you can &apos;t keep a secret ."
"But people are brutally honest with the Internet , and when these leaks started , many people were asking me about this ."
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
"Yet , I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency , especially a foreign intelligence agency ."
"And if we indeed need a Big Brother , I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother ."
"And when the leaks started , the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how , when you &apos;ve been using search engines , you &apos;ve been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence ."
"And two minutes later , I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me , like , why am I worried about this ?"
What am I sending to worry about this ? Am I sending naked pictures or something ?
"And my answer to Kimberly was that what I &apos;m sending is none of your business , and it should be none of your government &apos;s business either ."
Because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . It &apos;s about privacy .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
It should be built in to all the systems we use .
( Applause ) And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines .
"You show me your search history , and I &apos;ll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes ."
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families .
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you .
"And this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the United States ."
And surveillance changes history .
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon .
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today .
"And let me actually quote the president of Brazil , Ms. Dilma Rousseff ."
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
"Her email was read , and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters , and she said , &quot; &quot; If there is no right to privacy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it &apos;s about ."
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
"And to quote a fellow security researcher , Marcus Ranum , he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies ."
"So we are back to the age of colonization , and we , the foreign users of the Internet , we should think about Americans as our masters ."
"So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things ."
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations — and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , what is there to be done ?"
"Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry ."
"We should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done ."
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
What &apos;s going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
"A single country , any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services ."
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
"By building together open , free , secure systems , we can go around such surveillance , and then one country doesn &apos;t have to solve the problem by itself ."
It only has to solve one little problem .
"And to quote a fellow security researcher , Haroon Meer , one country only has to make a small wave , but those small waves together become a tide , and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time , and the tide we will build with secure , free , open-source systems , will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state ."
Thank you very much .

"( Music ) &#91; Sanskrit &#93; This is an ode to the mother goddess , that most of us in India learn when we are children ."
I learned it when I was four at my mother &apos;s knee .
"That year she introduced me to dance , and thus began my tryst with classical dance ."
"Since then — it &apos;s been four decades now — I &apos;ve trained with the best in the field , performed across the globe , taught young and old alike , created , collaborated , choreographed , and wove a rich tapestry of artistry , achievement and awards ."
"The crowning glory was in 2007 , when I received this country &apos;s fourth highest civilian award , the Padma Shri , for my contribution to art ."
"( Applause ) But nothing , nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008 ."
"I heard the word &quot; &quot; carcinoma . &quot; &quot; Yes , breast cancer ."
"As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor &apos;s office , I heard other words : &quot; cancer , &quot; &quot; stage , &quot; &quot; grade . &quot;"
"Until then , Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend , stage was what I performed on , and grades were what I got in school ."
"That day , I realized I had an unwelcome , uninvited , new life partner ."
"As a dancer , I know the nine rasas or the navarasas : anger , valor , disgust , humor and fear ."
I thought I knew what fear was .
"That day , I learned what fear was ."
"Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control , I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband , Jayant ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Is this it ? Is this the end of the road ?"
"Is this the end of my dance ? &quot; &quot; And he , the positive soul that he is , said , &quot; &quot; No , this is just a hiatus , a hiatus during the treatment , and you &apos;ll get back to doing what you do best . &quot; &quot; I realized then that I , who thought I had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : My thought , my mind — the images that these thoughts created — and the action that derived from it ."
"So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness ."
"I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be , for which I needed something ."
I needed something that would pull me out of all this .
"So I dried my tears , and I declared to the world at large ..."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Cancer &apos;s only one page in my life , and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out , and I would not allow cancer to ride me ."
"But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be , I needed something ."
"I needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that I could go from there ."
"And I found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my very life breath ."
But it wasn &apos;t easy .
"Believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy ."
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ?
"How do you not despair when , with the body ravaged by chemotherapy , climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture , that to someone like me who could dance for three hours ?"
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep .
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have .
"So I would drag myself into my dance studio — body , mind and spirit — every day into my dance studio , and learn everything I learned when I was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped ."
"It was excruciatingly painful , but I did it ."
Difficult .
"I focused on my mudras , on the imagery of my dance , on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself ."
"And slowly , I moved out of that miserable state of mind ."
But I needed something else .
"I needed something to go that extra mile , and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four ."
"The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini , of Durga ."
"Durga , the mother goddess , the fearless one , created by the pantheon of Hindu gods ."
"Durga , resplendent , bedecked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for warfare , as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur ."
"Durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti ."
"Durga , the fearless one ."
"I made that image of Durga and her every attribute , her every nuance , my very own ."
"Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training , I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance , laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery ."
"I danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist ."
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance .
"Yes , cancer has just been one page in my life ."
"My story is a story of overcoming setbacks , obstacles and challenges that life throws at you ."
My story is the power of thought .
My story is the power of choice .
It &apos;s the power of focus .
"It &apos;s the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you , so moves you , that something even like cancer becomes insignificant ."
My story is the power of a metaphor .
It &apos;s the power of an image .
"Mine was that of Durga , Durga the fearless one ."
"She was also called Simhanandini , the one who rode the lion ."
"As I ride out , as I ride my own inner strength , my own inner resilience , armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment , as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer , asking my rogue cells to behave , I want to be known not as a cancer survivor , but as a cancer conqueror ."
I present to you an excerpt of that work &quot; Simhanandini . &quot;

"But the difference here is that you can use any surface , you can walk up to any surface , including your hand , if nothing else is available , and interact with this projected data ."
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to begin with a thought experiment .
"Imagine that it &apos;s 4,000 years into the future ."
"Civilization as we know it has ceased to exist — no books , no electronic devices , no Facebook or Twitter ."
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost .
Now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities .
What might they find ?
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them .
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal .
Maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them .
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers — buried in the hills somewhere in North America — massive versions of these same symbols .
"Now let &apos;s ask ourselves , what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future ?"
This is no hypothetical question .
"In fact , this is exactly the kind of question we &apos;re faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization , which existed 4,000 years ago ."
"The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations , but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations ."
"It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers , covering what is now Pakistan , Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran ."
"Given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings ."
"In fact , what archeologists have found is none of that ."
They &apos;ve found small objects such as these .
Here &apos;s an example of one of these objects .
Well obviously this is a replica .
But who is this person ?
A king ? A god ?
A priest ?
Or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me ?
We don &apos;t know .
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them .
"Well no , not pieces of plastic , but stone seals , copper tablets , pottery and , surprisingly , one large sign board , which was found buried near the gate of a city ."
"Now we don &apos;t know if it says Hollywood , or even Bollywood for that matter ."
"In fact , we don &apos;t even know what any of these objects say , and that &apos;s because the Indus script is undeciphered ."
We don &apos;t know what any of these symbols mean .
The symbols are most commonly found on seals .
So you see up there one such object .
It &apos;s the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it .
Now that &apos;s a magnificent piece of art .
So how big do you think that is ?
Perhaps that big ?
Or maybe that big ?
Well let me show you .
Here &apos;s a replica of one such seal .
It &apos;s only about one inch by one inch in size — pretty tiny .
So what were these used for ?
We know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other .
So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes ?
These were used to make those kinds of packing slips .
You might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text .
Perhaps they &apos;re the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other — we don &apos;t know .
We need to decipher the script to answer that question .
Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle ; it &apos;s actually become a question that &apos;s become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia .
"In fact , the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people ."
"First , there &apos;s a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indus script does not represent a language at all ."
These people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields .
There &apos;s a second group of people who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language .
"If you look at a map of India today , you &apos;ll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo-European language family ."
So some people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit .
There &apos;s a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today .
"These people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient form of the Dravidian language family , which is the language family spoken in much of South India today ."
"And the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North , actually near Afghanistan , and they say that perhaps , sometime in the past , Dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian ."
Which of these hypotheses can be true ?
"We don &apos;t know , but perhaps if you deciphered the script , you would be able to answer this question ."
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task .
"First , there &apos;s no Rosetta Stone ."
I don &apos;t mean the software ; I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text .
We don &apos;t have such an artifact for the Indus script .
"And furthermore , we don &apos;t even know what language they spoke ."
"And to make matters even worse , most of the text that we have are extremely short ."
"So as I showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny ."
"And so given these formidable obstacles , one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script ."
"In the rest of my talk , I &apos;d like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script ."
I &apos;ve always been fascinated by the Indus script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook .
And why was I fascinated ?
Well it &apos;s the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world .
"My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist , so in my day job , I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions , how the brain makes decisions , how the brain learns and so on ."
"But in 2007 , my path crossed again with the Indus script ."
"That &apos;s when I was in India , and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script ."
"And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists , and so I jumped at that opportunity ."
And I &apos;d like to describe some of the results that we have found .
"Or better yet , let &apos;s all collectively decipher ."
Are you ready ?
The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing .
Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them .
Can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds .
"Okay . Right to left , how many ? Okay ."
Okay . Left to right ?
"Oh , it &apos;s almost 50 / 50 . Okay ."
"The answer is : if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a cramping of signs , and it seems like 4,000 years ago , when the scribe was writing from right to left , they ran out of space ."
And so they had to cram the sign .
One of the signs is also below the text on the top .
"This suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left , and so that &apos;s one of the first things we know , that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts ."
And the Indus script now has this particular property .
What other properties of language does the script show ?
Languages contain patterns .
"If I give you the letter Q and ask you to predict the next letter , what do you think that would be ?"
"Most of you said U , which is right ."
"Now if I asked you to predict one more letter , what do you think that would be ?"
"Now there &apos;s several thoughts . There &apos;s E. It could be I. It could be A , but certainly not B , C or D , right ?"
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns .
There &apos;s a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol .
And this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks-like symbol .
And this is very similar to a Q and U example .
"This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish-like symbols and some other signs , but never by these other signs at the bottom ."
"And furthermore , there &apos;s some signs that really prefer the end of texts , such as this jar-shaped sign , and this sign , in fact , happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script ."
"Given such patterns , here was our idea ."
"The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns , and so we gave the computer the existing texts ."
And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other .
"Given the computer model , we can test the model by essentially quizzing it ."
"So we could deliberately erase some symbols , and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols ."
Here are some examples .
You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune .
What we found was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol .
"In the rest of the cases , typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer ."
There &apos;s also practical use for this particular procedure .
There &apos;s a lot of these texts that are damaged .
Here &apos;s an example of one such text .
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction .
Here &apos;s an example of a symbol that was predicted .
And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze .
Now here &apos;s one other thing you can do with the computer model .
So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this .
Such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy .
This is a physics and information theory term .
But just imagine it &apos;s a really random jumble of letters .
How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard ?
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem — so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again .
This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there &apos;s no variation at all .
"Language , on the other hand , has an intermediate level of entropy ; it &apos;s neither too rigid , nor is it too random ."
What about the Indus script ?
Here &apos;s a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences .
"At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence , which is a random jumble of letters — and interestingly , we also find the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music ."
"And both of these are very , very flexible , which is why you find them in the very high range ."
"At the lower end of the scale , you find a rigid sequence , a sequence of all A &apos;s , and you also find a computer program , in this case in the language Fortran , which obeys really strict rules ."
Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range .
Now what about the Indus script ?
We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .
"When this result was first published , it was highly controversial ."
"There were people who raised a hue and cry , and these people were the ones who believed that the Indus script does not represent language ."
I even started to get some hate mail .
My students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection .
Who &apos;d have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession ?
What does this result really show ?
It shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language .
"So , as the old saying goes , if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script , then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands ."
What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language ?
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages .
"So for example , here &apos;s the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet ."
"If you don &apos;t know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch , you &apos;ll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns ."
"Some things are not right , and you &apos;ll say these words are probably not English words ."
The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script .
The computer found several texts — two of them are shown here — that have very unusual patterns .
So for example the first text : there &apos;s a doubling of this jar-shaped sign .
"This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign in the Indus script , and it &apos;s only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair ."
Why is that the case ?
"We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found , and it turns out that they were found very , very far away from the Indus Valley ."
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran .
And why were they found there ?
"What I haven &apos;t told you is that the Indus people were very , very enterprising ."
"They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived , and so in this case , they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia , present-day Iraq ."
"And what seems to have happened here is that the Indus traders , the merchants , were using this script to write a foreign language ."
It &apos;s just like our English and Dutch example .
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley .
"This suggests that the same script , the Indus script , could be used to write different languages ."
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language .
"If it does represent language , then how do we read the symbols ?"
That &apos;s our next big challenge .
"So you &apos;ll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans , of insects , of fishes , of birds ."
"Most ancient scripts use the rebus principle , which is , using pictures to represent words ."
"So as an example , here &apos;s a word ."
Can you write it using pictures ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple seconds .
Got it ?
Okay . Great .
Here &apos;s my solution .
"You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf — and that &apos;s &quot; &quot; belief , &quot; &quot; right ."
There could be other solutions .
"In the case of the Indus script , the problem is the reverse ."
You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense .
"So this is just like a crossword puzzle , except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it ."
"My colleagues , Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola , have been making some headway on this particular problem ."
And I &apos;d like to give you a quick example of Parpola &apos;s work .
Here &apos;s a really short text .
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign .
"And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods , so it &apos;s quite likely that these tags , at least some of them , contain names of merchants ."
And it turns out that in India there &apos;s a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .
"In Dravidian languages , the word for fish is &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; which happens to sound just like the word for star ."
"And so seven stars would stand for &quot; &quot; elu meen , &quot; &quot; which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation ."
"Similarly , there &apos;s another sequence of six stars , and that translates to &quot; &quot; aru meen , &quot; &quot; which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades ."
"And finally , there &apos;s other combinations , such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it ."
"And that could be translated into &quot; &quot; mey meen , &quot; &quot; which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn ."
So that was pretty exciting .
It looks like we &apos;re getting somewhere .
But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations ?
Well not yet .
"So we have no way of validating these particular readings , but if more and more of these readings start making sense , and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct , then we know that we are on the right track ."
"Today , we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script , because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century ."
The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly .
"The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century , but the Indus civilization remains silent ."
Why should we care ?
The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis ; it belongs to all of us .
These are our ancestors — yours and mine .
They were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history .
"If we decipher the script , we would enable them to speak to us again ."
What would they tell us ?
What would we find out about them ? About us ?
I can &apos;t wait to find out .
Thank you .

"Three years ago , I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four ."
"My Geiger counter dosimeter , which measures radiation , was going berserk , and the closer I got , the more frenetic it became , and frantic . My God ."
"I was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world &apos;s worst nuclear accident , as you can see by the look on my face , reluctantly so , but with good reason , because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima , and the sarcophagus , which is the covering over reactor number four , which was hastily built 27 years ago , now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation ."
So I was filming .
I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast .
"But then , I looked into the distance , and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse , and I &apos;m thinking , who could be living here ?"
"I mean , after all , Chernobyl &apos;s soil , water and air , are among the most highly contaminated on Earth , and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone , or dead zone , and it &apos;s a nuclear police state , complete with border guards ."
"You have to have dosimeter at all times , clicking away , you have to have a government minder , and there &apos;s draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring ."
"The point being , no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone ."
But they are .
It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone .
They &apos;re called self-settlers .
"And almost all of them are women , the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol , cigarettes , if not radiation ."
"Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident , but not everybody accepted that fate ."
"The women in the zone , now in their 70s and 80s , are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and , it would seem , common sense , and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone ."
They did so illegally .
"As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time , &quot; &quot; Shoot me and dig the grave ."
"Otherwise , I &apos;m going home . &quot; &quot; Now why would they return to such deadly soil ?"
"I mean , were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them , or both ?"
"The thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently ."
"Now around Chernobyl , there are scattered ghost villages , eerily silent , strangely charming , bucolic , totally contaminated ."
"Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident , but a few are left like this , kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy ."
"Others have a few residents in them , one or two &quot; &quot; babushkas , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; babas , &quot; &quot; which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother ."
Another village might have six or seven residents .
So this is the strange demographic of the zone — isolated alone together .
"And when I made my way to that piping chimney I &apos;d seen in the distance , I saw Hanna Zavorotnya , and I met her ."
"She &apos;s the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village , population eight ."
"( Laughter ) And she said to me , when I asked her the obvious , &quot; Radiation doesn &apos;t scare me . Starvation does . &quot;"
"And you have to remember , these women have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century ."
"Stalin &apos;s enforced famines of the 1930s , the Holodomor , killed millions of Ukrainians , and they faced the Nazis in the &apos; 40s , who came through slashing , burning , raping , and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor ."
"So when a couple decades into Soviet rule , Chernobyl happened , they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible ."
"So they returned to their villages and are told they &apos;re going to get sick and die soon , but five happy years , their logic goes , is better than 10 stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev , separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies , the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon ."
"For them , environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation ."
It turns out this holds true for other species as well .
"Wild boar , lynx , moose , they &apos;ve all returned to the region in force , the very real , very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans ."
"The dead zone , it turns out , is full of life ."
"And there is a kind of heroic resilience , a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m."
"pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes , their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka ."
And there &apos;s a patina of simple defiance among them .
"&quot; They told us our legs would hurt , and they do . So what ? &quot;"
"I mean , what about their health ?"
"The benefits of hardy , physical living , but an environment made toxic by a complicated , little-understood enemy , radiation ."
It &apos;s incredibly difficult to parse .
Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
"The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000 , eventually ."
Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands .
"Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high , and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere : higher levels of anxiety , depression , alcoholism , unemployment and , importantly , disrupted social networks ."
"Now , like many of you , I have moved maybe 20 , 25 times in my life ."
Home is a transient concept .
I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil .
"So it &apos;s hard for us to understand , but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka , and connection to the land is palpable ."
"And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets , aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time ."
"&quot; If you leave , you die . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Those who left are worse off now .
They are dying of sadness . &quot; &quot; &quot; Motherland is motherland . I will never leave . &quot;
"What sounds like faith , soft faith , may actually be fact , because the surprising truth — I mean , there are no studies , but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years , have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation , by some estimates up to 10 years ."
How could this be ?
"Here &apos;s a theory : Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil , the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms , actually affect longevity ?"
The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative .
Home and community are forces that rival even radiation .
"Now radiation or not , these women are at the end of their lives ."
"In the next decade , the zone &apos;s human residents will be gone , and it will revert to a wild , radioactive place , full only of animals and occasionally daring , flummoxed scientists ."
"But the spirit and existence of the babushkas , whose numbers have been halved in the three years I &apos;ve known them , will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with , about the relative nature of risk , about transformative connections to home , and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination ."
Thank you .

"To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I &apos;m about to tell you of practical value , let me ask you please to raise your hands : Who here is either over 65 years old or hopes to live past age 65 or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past 65 , raise your hands please . ( Laughter ) Okay . You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value . ( Laughter ) The rest of you won &apos;t find my talk personally relevant , but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating ."
I &apos;m going to talk about growing older in traditional societies .
"This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book , which compares traditional , small , tribal societies with our large , modern societies , with respect to many topics such as bringing up children , growing older , health , dealing with danger , settling disputes , religion and speaking more than one language ."
"Those tribal societies , which constituted all human societies for most of human history , are far more diverse than are our modern , recent , big societies ."
"All big societies that have governments , and where most people are strangers to each other , are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies ."
Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society .
They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn .
"Tribal societies shouldn &apos;t be scorned as primitive and miserable , but also they shouldn &apos;t be romanticized as happy and peaceful ."
"When we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves ."
"Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends ."
"Nevertheless , the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies , from much worse to much better than in our modern societies ."
"At the worst extreme , many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways : by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die , or by abandoning them when the group moves , or by encouraging older people to commit suicide , or by killing older people ."
In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
It happens mainly under two conditions .
"One is in nomadic , hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can &apos;t walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions ."
"The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments , such as the Arctic or deserts , where there are periodic food shortages , and occasionally there just isn &apos;t enough food to keep everyone alive ."
Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able-bodied adults and for children .
"To us Americans , it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father , but what could those traditional societies do differently ?"
They face a cruel situation of no choice .
"Their old people had to do it to their own parents , and the old people know what now is going to happen to them ."
"At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly , the happy extreme , are the New Guinea farming societies where I &apos;ve been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years , and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world ."
"In those societies , older people are cared for ."
They are fed . They remain valuable .
"And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children , relatives and lifelong friends ."
There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people .
The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society &apos;s values .
"First , as regards usefulness , older people continue to perform useful services ."
One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food .
"Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren ."
"Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools , weapons , baskets , pots and textiles ."
"In fact , they &apos;re usually the people who are best at it ."
"Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances ."
"Finally , older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern , literate societies , where our sources of information are books and the Internet ."
"In contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information ."
It &apos;s their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience .
"Those , then , are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies ."
Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society &apos;s treatment of the elderly .
The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society &apos;s cultural values .
"For example , there &apos;s particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia , associated with Confucius &apos; doctrine of filial piety , which means obedience , respect and support for elderly parents ."
Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S.
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources .
"That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited , for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant , or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients , American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them , even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them ."
There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S.
"One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work , so older people who are no longer working aren &apos;t respected ."
"Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent ."
"Still a third reason is our American cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements ."
"Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people , even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer ."
"Just think , what &apos;s the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old ? Never ."
"Instead , the only American ads featuring white-haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning ."
"Well , what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies ?"
There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse .
"Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives , much better health in our old age , and much better recreational opportunities ."
Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people .
Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past .
"That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people , and that each old person has less individual value ."
"Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age , because older people , their children , and their friends , all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives ."
We Americans move on the average every five years .
Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth .
"Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce , carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work ."
Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies .
Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge .
"When we want some information , we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask ."
"The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old , but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later ."
"And conversely , we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society ."
"For example , as a 15-year-old , I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I &apos;m quick at manipulating a slide rule ."
"Today , though , those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator ."
"Conversely , I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life ."
"My family &apos;s first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered : an on-off switch , a volume knob , and a channel selector knob ."
"Today , just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house , I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me ."
I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons .
"What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S. , and to make better use of their value ?"
That &apos;s a huge problem .
"In my remaining four minutes today , I can offer just a few suggestions ."
"One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children ."
"Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers , grandparents offer superior , motivated , experienced child care ."
They &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
"They usually love their grandchildren , and are eager to spend time with them ."
"Unlike other caregivers , grandparents don &apos;t quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby ."
A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology .
"At the same time , older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change , but that could come back ."
"For example , only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs ."
"Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older Americans do ."
"Unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back ."
"Even if they don &apos;t come back , we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like ."
Older people have that experience .
Younger people don &apos;t .
"The remaining value of older people that I &apos;ll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do , there are other things that they can do better than younger people ."
A challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing .
"Some abilities , of course , decrease with age ."
"Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina , ambition , and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation , such as figuring out the structure of DNA , best left to scientists under the age of 30 ."
"Conversely , valuable attributes that increase with age include experience , understanding of people and human relationships , ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way , and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases , such as economics and comparative history , best left to scholars over the age of 60 ."
"Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising , administering , advising , strategizing , teaching , synthesizing , and devising long-term plans ."
"I &apos;ve seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s , 70s , 80s and 90s , who are still active as investment managers , farmers , lawyers and doctors ."
"In short , many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern , big societies ."
"Paradoxically nowadays , when we have more elderly people than ever before , living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before , old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before ."
The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society .
We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies .
But what &apos;s true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well .
"Of course , I &apos;m not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle ."
"There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small , traditional societies ."
"To mention just a few examples , our lives are longer , materially much richer , and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies ."
"But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies , and perhaps to be learned from them ."
"Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives , although materially poorer ."
"Their children are more self-confident , more independent , and more socially skilled than are our children ."
They think more realistically about dangers than we do .
"They almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today ."
"Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases , and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them ."
Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies .
Thank you .

Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
"In my own humanity and mistakes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we assume ?
"Or better , how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?"
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
"Year after year , after year , they &apos;re more innovative than all their competition ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great orator of the day ."
"And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern ."
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
"All I did was codify it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simplest idea ."
I call it the golden circle .
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
Let me define the terms really quickly .
"Every single person , every single organization on the planet knows what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do ."
"By &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your purpose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
I use Apple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly ."
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
"&quot; &quot; Everything we do , we believe in challenging the status quo ."
We believe in thinking differently .
We just happen to make great computers .
"But we &apos;re also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple , or a phone from Apple , or a DVR from Apple ."
Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products .
"A few years ago , Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs ."
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs .
Nobody bought one .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
"Not psychology , biology ."
"Our newest brain , our Homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language .
"The middle two sections make up our limbic brains , and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings , like trust and loyalty ."
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
This is where gut decisions come from .
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to hire people who believe what you believe .
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
"And Samuel Pierpont Langley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success ."
Money was no problem .
He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic .
"The New York Times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for Langley ."
Then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
"The difference was , Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief ."
"They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
"And lo and behold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the paycheck .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get famous , so he quit ."
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe ?
The next 13.5 % of our population are our early adopters .
"And these guys , the innovators and the early adopters , they &apos;re comfortable making those gut decisions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe ."
"So let me give you a famous example , a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation ."
It &apos;s a commercial example .
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went IPO , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted , and it &apos;s never traded above 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the summer of 1963 , 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gift .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for themselves .
"We followed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
"Leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us ."
"Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal ."
It takes guts to stand out like that .
So a movement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
"And what a perfect place to do that , at TED ."

"Many times I go around the world to speak , and people ask me questions about the challenges , my moments , some of my regrets ."
"1998 : A single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , I went to do a job as a research assistant ."
I went to Northern Liberia .
"And as part of the work , the village would give you lodgings ."
And they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter .
This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade .
She was the laughing stock of the community .
"Her mother was often told by other women , &quot; &quot; You and your child will die poor . &quot; &quot; After two weeks of working in that village , it was time to go back ."
"The mother came to me , knelt down , and said , &quot; &quot; Leymah , take my daughter ."
"I wish for her to be a nurse . &quot; &quot; Dirt poor , living in the home with my parents , I couldn &apos;t afford to ."
"With tears in my eyes , I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Two months later , I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief ."
"The women &apos;s chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty ."
And all day she walked around only in her underwear .
"When I asked , &quot; &quot; Who is that ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s Wei ."
The meaning of her name is pig .
"Her mother died while giving birth to her , and no one had any idea who her father was . &quot; &quot; For two weeks , she became my companion , slept with me ."
I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll .
"The night before I left , she came to the room and said , &quot; &quot; Leymah , don &apos;t leave me here ."
I wish to go with you .
"I wish to go to school . &quot; &quot; Dirt poor , no money , living with my parents , I again said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Two months later , both of those villages fell into another war ."
"Till today , I have no idea where those two girls are ."
"Fast-forward , 2004 : In the peak of our activism , the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said , &quot; &quot; Leymah , I have a nine-year-old for you ."
I want you to bring her home because we don &apos;t have safe homes . &quot; &quot; The story of this little girl : She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months .
"She came to me bloated , very pale ."
Every night I &apos;d come from work and lie on the cold floor .
"She &apos;d lie beside me and say , &quot; &quot; Auntie , I wish to be well ."
"I wish to go to school . &quot; &quot; 2010 : A young woman stands before President Sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together , their father and mother died during the war ."
She &apos;s 19 ; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them .
She &apos;s highly athletic .
One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship .
Full scholarship . She gets it .
"Her dream of going to school , her wish of being educated , is finally here ."
She goes to school on the first day .
The director of sports who &apos;s responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class .
"And for the next three years , her fate will be having sex with him every day , as a favor for getting her in school ."
"Globally , we have policies , international instruments , work leaders ."
Great people have made commitments — we will protect our children from want and from fear .
The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
"Countries like America , we &apos;ve heard things like No Child Left Behind ."
Other countries come with different things .
There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls .
"All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally , I think , has failed ."
"In Liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls ."
Teen prostitution is at its peak .
"In one community , we &apos;re told , you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper ."
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night .
"It &apos;s disheartening , it &apos;s sad ."
"And then someone asked me , just before my TEDTalk , a few days ago , &quot; So where is the hope ? &quot;"
"Several years ago , a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women ."
"It &apos;s not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls &apos; kids are totally out there and no hope , or seemingly no hope ."
We created a space called the Young Girls Transformative Project .
"We go into rural communities and all we do , like has been done in this room , is create the space ."
"When these girls sit , you unlock intelligence , you unlock passion , you unlock commitment , you unlock focus , you unlock great leaders ."
"Today , we &apos;ve worked with over 300 ."
"And some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps , as young mothers , to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women ."
"One young woman I met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college ."
"One day she said to me , &quot; &quot; My wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s at a place where she can &apos;t find money to go to school ."
"She sells water , sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones ."
And you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education .
Juanita is her name .
She takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school .
"Says , &quot; &quot; Leymah , my wish is to be educated ."
"And if I can &apos;t be educated , when I see some of my sisters being educated , my wish has been fulfilled ."
I wish for a better life .
I wish for food for my children .
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop . &quot; &quot; This is the dream of the African girl .
"Several years ago , there was one African girl ."
This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry .
"Angry , frustrated , really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children , this young girl started a movement , a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace ."
I will fulfill the wish .
This is another African girl &apos;s wish .
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls .
I failed to do this .
"These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman — I failed , I failed , I failed ."
So I will do this .
"Women came out , protested a brutal dictator , fearlessly spoke ."
"Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true , the wish of peace came true ."
This young woman wished also to go to school .
She went to school .
"This young woman wished for other things to happen , it happened for her ."
"Today , this young woman is me , a Nobel laureate ."
"I &apos;m now on a journey to fulfill the wish , in my tiny capacity , of little African girls — the wish of being educated ."
We set up a foundation .
We &apos;re giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential .
I don &apos;t have much to ask of you .
"I &apos;ve also been to places in this U.S. , and I know that girls in this country also have wishes , a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx , a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A. , a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas , a wish for a better life somewhere in New York , a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey ."
"Will you journey with me to help that girl , be it an African girl or an American girl or a Japanese girl , fulfill her wish , fulfill her dream , achieve that dream ?"
"Because all of these great innovators and inventors that we &apos;ve talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world , and all they &apos;re asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence , unlock the passion , unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves ."
Let &apos;s journey together . Let &apos;s journey together .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you so much .
"Right now in Liberia , what do you see as the main issue that troubles you ?"
LG : I &apos;ve been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative .
"As part of my work , I &apos;m doing these tours in different villages and towns — 13 , 15 hours on dirt roads — and there is no community that I &apos;ve gone into that I haven &apos;t seen intelligent girls ."
"But sadly , the vision of a great future , or the dream of a great future , is just a dream , because you have all of these vices ."
"Teen pregnancy , like I said , is epidemic ."
"So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I &apos;m at this place , and I just don &apos;t want to be the only one at this place ."
I &apos;m looking for ways for other girls to be with me .
"I want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s another Liberian girl , Ghanaian girl , Nigerian girl , Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage ."
"And maybe , just maybe , saying , &quot; &quot; Because of that Nobel laureate I &apos;m here today . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m troubled when I see them like there &apos;s no hope ."
"But I &apos;m also not pessimistic , because I know it doesn &apos;t take a lot to get them charged up ."
"CA : And in the last year , tell us one hopeful thing that you &apos;ve seen happening ."
LG : I can tell you many hopeful things that I &apos;ve seen happening .
"But in the last year , where President Sirleaf comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls ."
And we could not find 25 girls in high school .
"All of these girls went to the gold mine , and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things ."
We took 50 of those girls and we worked with them .
And this was at the beginning of elections .
This is one place where women were never — even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men .
These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration .
This is a real rural village .
And the theme they used was : &quot; Even pretty girls vote . &quot;
They were able to mobilize young women .
"But not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , &quot; &quot; What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? &quot; &quot; And one of the guys who already had a seat was very — because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws , and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric ."
"Rape is not barbaric , but the law , he said , was barbaric ."
"And when the girls started engaging him , he was very hostile towards them ."
"These little girls turned to him and said , &quot; We will vote you out of office . &quot;"
He &apos;s out of office today .
"( Applause ) CA : Leymah , thank you . Thank you so much for coming to TED ."
LG : You &apos;re welcome . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I know a man who soars above the city every night .
"In his dreams , he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the Earth ."
"Everything has motion , he claims , even a body as paralyzed as his own ."
This man is my father .
"Three years ago , when I found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem , I walked into his room in the ICU at the Montreal Neurological Institute and found him lying deathly still , tethered to a breathing machine ."
"Paralysis had closed over his body slowly , beginning in his toes , then legs , torso , fingers and arms ."
"It made its way up his neck , cutting off his ability to breathe , and stopped just beneath the eyes ."
He never lost consciousness .
"Rather , he watched from within as his body shut down , limb by limb , muscle by muscle ."
"In that ICU room , I walked up to my father &apos;s body , and with a quivering voice and through tears , I began reciting the alphabet ."
"A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I , J , K."
"At K , he blinked his eyes ."
I began again .
"A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I."
"He blinked again at the letter I , then at T , then at R , and A : Kitra ."
"He said &quot; &quot; Kitra , my beauty , don &apos;t cry ."
"This is a blessing . &quot; &quot; There was no audible voice , but my father called out my name powerfully ."
"Despite his extreme physical state , he was completely present with me , guiding , nurturing , and being my father as much if not more than ever before ."
Locked-in syndrome is many people &apos;s worst nightmare .
"In French , it &apos;s sometimes called &quot; maladie de l &apos;emmuré vivant . &quot;"
"Literally , &quot; &quot; walled-in-alive disease . &quot; &quot; For many people , perhaps most , paralysis is an unspeakable horror , but my father &apos;s experience losing every system of his body was not an experience of feeling trapped , but rather of turning the psyche inwards , dimming down the external chatter , facing the recesses of his own mind , and in that place , falling in love with life and body anew ."
"As a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body , life and death , the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him ."
He realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world in order to find the divine .
&quot; &quot; Paradise is in this body .
"It &apos;s in this world , &quot; &quot; he said ."
"I slept by my father &apos;s side for the first four months , tending as much as I could to his every discomfort , understanding the deep human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help ."
"My mother , sisters , brother and I , we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing ."
"We became his mouthpiece , spending hours each day reciting the alphabet as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye ."
"His bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel , and through us , my father was able to speak and uplift , letter by letter , blink by blink ."
"Everything in our world became slow and tender as the din , drama and death of the hospital ward faded into the background ."
I want to read to you one of the first things that we transcribed in the week following the stroke .
"He composed a letter , addressing his synagogue congregation , and ended it with the following lines : &quot; &quot; When my nape exploded , I entered another dimension : inchoate , sub-planetary , protozoan ."
Universes are opened and closed continually .
"There are many when low , who stop growing ."
"Last week , I was brought so low , but I felt the hand of my father around me , and my father brought me back . &quot; &quot; When we weren &apos;t his voice , we were his legs and arms ."
I moved them like I know I would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day .
"I remember I &apos;d hold his fingers near my face , bending each joint to keep it soft and limber ."
"I &apos;d ask him again and again to visualize the motion , to watch from within as the finger curled and extended , and to move along with it in his mind ."
"Then , one day , from the corner of my eye , I saw his body slither like a snake , an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs ."
"At first , I thought it was my own hallucination , having spent so much time tending to this one body , so desperate to see anything react on its own ."
"But he told me he felt tingles , sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin ."
"The following week , he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance ."
Connections were being made .
"Body was slowly and gently reawakening , limb by limb , muscle by muscle , twitch by twitch ."
"As a documentary photographer , I felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn ."
"I photographed him taking his first unaided breath , the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time , the new adapted technologies that allowed him to gain more and more independence ."
I photographed the care and the love that surrounded him .
But my photographs only told the outside story of a man lying in a hospital bed attached to a breathing machine .
"I wasn &apos;t able to portray his story from within , and so I began to search for a new visual language , one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience ."
( Video ) Ronnie Cahana : You have to believe you &apos;re paralyzed to play the part of a quadriplegic .
I don &apos;t .
"In my mind , and in my dreams every night I Chagall-man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor ."
I know nothing about the statement of man without motion .
Everything has motion .
The heart pumps .
The body heaves .
The mouth moves .
We never stagnate .
Life triumphs up and down .
"Kitra Cahana : For most of us , our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious , but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience ."
"Like an astronaut who sees a perspective that very few of us will ever get to share , he wonders and watches as he takes his first breaths and dreams about crawling back home ."
"So begins life at 57 , he says ."
"A toddler has no attitude in its being , but a man insists on his world every day ."
"Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has , but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives ."
"I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable , but my father insists that there are no dead ends ."
"Instead , he invites me into his space of co-healing to give the very best of myself , and for him to give the very best of himself to me ."
Paralysis was an opening for him .
"It was an opportunity to emerge , to rekindle life force , to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation ."
"Today , my father is no longer locked in ."
"He moves his neck with ease , has had his feeding peg removed , breathes with his own lungs , speaks slowly with his own quiet voice , and works every day to gain more movement in his paralyzed body ."
But the work will never be finished .
"As he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m living in a broken world , and there is holy work to do . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

Hi .
( Laughter ) I did that for two reasons .
"First of all , I wanted to give you a good visual first impression ."
But the main reason I did it is that that &apos;s what happens to me when I &apos;m forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
It &apos;s the sensible shoe of public address .
"( Laughter ) But you clamp this thing on my head , and something happens ."
I just become skanky .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m sorry about that .
And I &apos;m already off-message .
"( Laughter ) Ladies and gentlemen , I have devoted the past 25 years of my life to designing books ."
"( &quot; &quot; Yes , BOOKS . You know , the bound volumes with ink on paper ."
You cannot turn them off with a switch .
"Tell your kids . &quot; &quot; ) It all sort of started as a benign mistake , like penicillin . ( Laughter ) What I really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in New York City ."
"But upon arrival there , in the fall of 1986 , and doing a lot of interviews , I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf , a book publisher ."
"Now I was stupid , but not so stupid that I turned it down ."
"I had absolutely no idea what I was about to become part of , and I was incredibly lucky ."
"Soon , it had occurred to me what my job was ."
My job was to ask this question : &quot; What do the stories look like ? &quot;
Because that is what Knopf is .
"It is the story factory , one of the very best in the world ."
We bring stories to the public .
"The stories can be anything , and some of them are actually true ."
But they all have one thing in common : They all need to look like something .
They all need a face .
Why ? To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into .
"A book designer gives form to content , but also manages a very careful balance between the two ."
"Now , the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University , the teacher , Lanny Sommese , came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard , and wrote the word &quot; &quot; Apple &quot; &quot; underneath , and he said , &quot; &quot; OK . Lesson one . Listen up . &quot; &quot; And he covered up the picture and he said , &quot; &quot; You either say this , &quot; &quot; and then he covered up the word , &quot; &quot; or you show this ."
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; Because this is treating your audience like a moron .
( Laughter ) And they deserve better .
"And lo and behold , soon enough , I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf ."
"The first was Katharine Hepburn &apos;s memoirs , and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich ."
"Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style , it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you ."
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter ; it was a biography .
"So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures , and so we did this ."
So there you are .
"Pure content and pure form , side by side ."
"No fighting , ladies ."
"( &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a Jurassic Park ? &quot; &quot; ) Now , what is the story here ?"
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber .
Genius !
"( Laughter ) Now , luckily for me , I live and work in New York City , where there are plenty of dinosaurs . ( Laughter )"
"So , I went to the Museum of Natural History , and I checked out the bones , and I went to the gift shop , and I bought a book ."
"And I was particularly taken with this page of the book , and more specifically the lower right-hand corner ."
"Now I took this diagram , and I put it in a Photostat machine , ( Laughter ) and I took a piece of tracing paper , and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape — stop me if I &apos;m going too fast — ( Laughter ) — and then I took a Rapidograph pen — explain it to the youngsters — ( Laughter ) and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur ."
"I had no idea what I was doing , I had no idea where I was going , but at some point , I stopped — when to keep going would seem like I was going too far ."
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being .
We &apos;re in the middle of the process .
And then I just threw some typography on it .
"Very basic stuff , slightly suggestive of public park signage ."
"( Laughter ) Everybody in house loved it , and so off it goes to the author ."
"And even back then , Michael was on the cutting edge ."
( &quot; &quot; Michael Crichton responds by fax : &quot; &quot; ) ( &quot; &quot; Wow ! Fucking Fantastic Jacket &quot; &quot; ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine . ( Laughter )
I miss Michael .
"And sure enough , somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image , just in case they might want to use it ."
"Well , they used it ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I was thrilled .
"We all know it was an amazing movie , and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it ."
"But not too long ago , I came upon this on the Web ."
"No , that is not me ."
"But whoever it is , I can &apos;t help but thinking they woke up one day like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , that wasn &apos;t there last night . Ooooohh !"
"I was so wasted . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But if you think about it , from my head to my hands to his leg . ( Laughter )"
That &apos;s a responsibility .
And it &apos;s a responsibility that I don &apos;t take lightly .
"The book designer &apos;s responsibility is threefold : to the reader , to the publisher and , most of all , to the author ."
"I want you to look at the author &apos;s book and say , &quot; &quot; Wow ! I need to read that . &quot; &quot; David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers , and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony ."
"And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image , and he wanted to explore what was underlying that ."
"For me , it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of ."
"But when you do , you don &apos;t get what you expect ."
You get something that goes much deeper than that .
"And David especially loved this design because at book signings , which he does a lot of , he could take a magic marker and do this ."
( Laughter ) Hello ! ( Laughter )
"Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called &#91; &quot; &quot; Dry &quot; &quot; &#93; , and it &apos;s about his time in rehab ."
"In his 20s , he was a hotshot ad executive , and as Mad Men has told us , a raging alcoholic ."
"He did not think so , however , but his coworkers did an intervention and they said , &quot; You are going to rehab , or you will be fired and you will die . &quot;"
"Now to me , this was always going to be a typographic solution , what I would call the opposite of Type 101 ."
What does that mean ?
"Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography , you get the assignment of , select a word and make it look like what it says it is . So that &apos;s Type 101 , right ?"
Very simple stuff .
This is going to be the opposite of that .
"I want this book to look like it &apos;s lying to you , desperately and hopelessly , the way an alcoholic would ."
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
"I set up the type , I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink , taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it . Presto !"
"Then when we went to press , the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running ."
"Not long after it came out , Augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books ."
"And this woman came up to it , and she squinted , and she took it to the register , and she said to the man behind the counter , &quot; &quot; This one &apos;s ruined . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the guy behind the counter said , &quot; &quot; I know , lady . They all came in that way . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s a good printing job ."
A book cover is a distillation .
"It is a haiku , if you will , of the story ."
"This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha , and it &apos;s eight volumes in all . But the best thing is when it &apos;s on your shelf , you get a shelf life of the Buddha , moving from one age to the next ."
"All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book , but once the book designer has read the text , then he has to be an interpreter and a translator ."
This story was a real puzzle .
This is what it &apos;s about .
"( &quot; &quot; Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters . &quot; &quot; ) ( Laughter ) All right , so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together ."
"And so , here &apos;s the design , right ?"
"And so here &apos;s the front and the spine , and it &apos;s flat ."
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf .
"Ahh ! We come upon them , the clandestine lovers . Let &apos;s draw them out ."
Huhh ! They &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
He will not be pleased .
Huhh ! And now the sultan is in danger .
"And now , we have to open it up to find out what &apos;s going to happen next ."
Try experiencing that on a Kindle .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t get me started .
Seriously .
"Much is to be gained by eBooks : ease , convenience , portability ."
"But something is definitely lost : tradition , a sensual experience , the comfort of thingy-ness — a little bit of humanity ."
Do you know what John Updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf ?
He &apos;d smell it .
"Then he &apos;d run his hand over the rag paper , and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages ."
"All those years , all those books , he never got tired of it ."
"Now , I am all for the iPad , but trust me — smelling it will get you nowhere ."
"( Laughter ) Now the Apple guys are texting , &quot; Develop odor emission plug-in . &quot; ( Laughter )"
And the last story I &apos;m going to talk about is quite a story .
"A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway . When she gets to the bottom , she can &apos;t help but feel that , all of a sudden , she &apos;s entered a new reality that &apos;s just slightly different from the one that she left , but very similar , but different ."
"And so , we &apos;re talking about parallel planes of existence , sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers ."
So how do we show this ?
"We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich , but now we merge them ."
"So we &apos;re talking about different planes , different pieces of paper ."
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum .
It &apos;s one part of the form and content .
"When it &apos;s on top of the paper board , which is the opposite , it forms this ."
"So even if you don &apos;t know anything about this book , you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence ."
"And the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch ."
This debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list .
"This is unheard of , both for us the publisher , and the author ."
"We &apos;re talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling , and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode ."
( Laughter ) Not exactly Jackie Collins .
"Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list , eight printings , and still going strong ."
"So even though we love publishing as an art , we very much know it &apos;s a business too , and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky , that great art can be great business ."
So that &apos;s my story . To be continued .
What does it look like ?
"Yes . It can , it does and it will , but for this book designer , page-turner , dog-eared place-holder , notes in the margins-taker , ink-sniffer , the story looks like this ."
Thank you .

Why do so many people reach success and then fail ?
"One of the big reasons is , we think success is a one-way street ."
"So we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . We figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go downhill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"Reaching success , I worked hard , I pushed myself ."
"But then I stopped , because I figured , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I made it ."
"I can just sit back and relax . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I always tried to improve and do good work ."
"But then I stopped because I figured , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I stopped , because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like magic ."
And the only thing that came was creative block .
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"Reaching success , I always focused on clients and projects , and ignored the money . Then all this money started pouring in ."
And I got distracted by it .
"And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent , when I should have been talking to my clients ."
"And reaching success , I always did what I loved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like management . I am the world &apos;s worst manager , but I figured I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the president of the company ."
"Well , soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was , outwardly very successful , but inwardly very depressed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fix it .
I bought a fast car .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was faster but just as depressed .
"So I went to my doctor . I said , &quot; &quot; Doc , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depressed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy Prozac . &quot; &quot; And he put me on anti-depressants ."
"And yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just floating along . I couldn &apos;t care less if clients ever called ."
( Laughter ) And clients didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer serving them , I was only serving myself ."
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for business to drop like a rock ."
"My partner and I , Thom , we had to let all our employees go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no employees , there was nobody for me to manage ."
So I went back to doing the projects I loved .
"I had fun again , I worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , business grew bigger than ever ."
"And when I went back to following these eight principles , the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether ."
"And I woke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need Prozac anymore . &quot;"
And I threw it away and haven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a continuous journey .
"And if we want to avoid &quot; &quot; success-to-failure-syndrome , &quot; &quot; we just keep following these eight principles , because that is not only how we achieve success , it &apos;s how we sustain it ."
So here is to your continued success .
Thank you very much .

"Well after many years working in trade and economics , four years ago , I found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability ."
And I found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can &apos;t even obtain a meal .
This red cup comes from Rwanda from a child named Fabian .
"And I carry this around as a symbol , really , of the challenge and also the hope ."
Because one cup of food a day changes Fabian &apos;s life completely .
"But what I &apos;d like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on Earth — or one out of every seven — woke up and didn &apos;t even know how to fill this cup ."
One out of every seven people .
"First , I &apos;ll ask you : Why should you care ?"
Why should we care ?
"For most people , if they think about hunger , they don &apos;t have to go far back on their own family history — maybe in their own lives , or their parents &apos; lives , or their grandparents &apos; lives — to remember an experience of hunger ."
I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience .
"Some are driven by compassion , feel it &apos;s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity ."
"As Gandhi said , &quot; To a hungry man , a piece of bread is the face of God . &quot;"
"Others worry about peace and security , stability in the world ."
"We saw the food riots in 2008 , after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight ."
The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history .
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food .
Others think about Malthusian nightmares .
Will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades ?
"This is not a negotiable thing , hunger ."
People have to eat .
There &apos;s going to be a lot of people .
This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain .
But I actually came to this issue in a different way .
This is a picture of me and my three children .
"In 1987 , I was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television ."
And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia .
One two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
"But it never struck me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby , and she had no milk to nurse ."
"And the baby &apos;s cry really penetrated me , as a mother ."
"And I thought , there &apos;s nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned with food — the most fundamental expectation of every human being ."
And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem .
This isn &apos;t one of those rare diseases that we don &apos;t have the solution for .
We know how to fix hunger .
"A hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t ."
We actually have the technology and systems .
And I was just struck that this is out of place .
"At our time in history , these images are out of place ."
Well guess what ?
This is last week in northern Kenya .
"Yet again , the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day ."
"In fact , what we know now is that every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger ."
"This is more than HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis combined ."
And we know that the issue is not just production of food .
"One of my mentors in life was Norman Borlaug , my hero ."
"But today I &apos;m going to talk about access to food , because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis , there was enough food on Earth for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories ."
So why is it that we have a billion people who can &apos;t find food ?
And I also want to talk about what I call our new burden of knowledge .
"In 2008 , Lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days — from conception to two years old — does not have adequate nutrition , the damage is irreversible ."
Their brains and bodies will be stunted .
"And here you see a brain scan of two children — one who had adequate nutrition , another , neglected and who was deeply malnourished ."
And we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less in these children .
And in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don &apos;t form .
"And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies , which I &apos;ll talk about later ."
But also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years .
So this burden of knowledge drives me .
Because actually we know how to fix it very simply .
"And yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hardship due to this ."
"I &apos;d like to talk about some of the things I &apos;ve seen on the front lines of hunger , some of the things I &apos;ve learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector ."
I &apos;d like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is .
"Well first , I &apos;d like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth , breastfeeding ."
You may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every 22 seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life .
"But in Niger , for example , less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life , exclusively ."
"In Mauritania , less than three percent ."
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge .
"This message , this word , can come out that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business ; it &apos;s a brilliant way of saving your child &apos;s life ."
"And so today we focus on not just passing out food , but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment , and teaching them about breastfeeding ."
"The second thing I &apos;d like to talk about : If you were living in a remote village somewhere , your child was limp , and you were in a drought , or you were in floods , or you were in a situation where there wasn &apos;t adequate diversity of diet , what would you do ?"
"Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars , like we can , and pick the right one to match ?"
Well I find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count .
"And I go to those shops , if there are any , or out to the fields to see what they can get , and they cannot obtain the nutrition ."
"Even if they know what they need to do , it &apos;s not available ."
"And I &apos;m very excited about this , because one thing we &apos;re working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops ."
"And this is made with chickpeas , dried milk and a host of vitamins , matched to exactly what the brain needs ."
"It costs 17 cents for us to produce this as , what I call , food for humanity ."
We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan — really about three of them .
But this is transforming 99 percent of the kids who get this .
"One package , 17 cents a day — their malnutrition is overcome ."
So I am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods .
And this is climate-proof .
"It doesn &apos;t need to be refrigerated , it doesn &apos;t need water , which is often lacking ."
"And these types of technologies , I see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition , malnutrition out on the front lines ."
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding .
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
"When disaster strikes — the economy gets blown , people lose a job , floods , war , conflict , bad governance , all of those things — there is nothing to fall back on ."
"And usually the institutions — churches , temples , other things — do not have the resources to provide a safety net ."
"What we have found working with the World Bank is that the poor man &apos;s safety net , the best investment , is school feeding ."
"And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers , you have a transformative effect ."
Many kids in the world can &apos;t go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal .
"But when that food is there , it &apos;s transformative ."
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid &apos;s life .
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls .
"In countries where girls don &apos;t go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school , we see enrollment rates about 50 percent girls and boys ."
We see a transformation in attendance by girls .
"And there was no argument , because it &apos;s incentive ."
Families need the help .
"And we find that if we keep girls in school later , they &apos;ll stay in school until they &apos;re 16 , and won &apos;t get married if there &apos;s food in school ."
"Or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week — it costs about 50 cents — will keep a girl in school , and they &apos;ll give birth to a healthier child , because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation ."
We know that there &apos;s boom and bust cycles of hunger .
We know this .
"Right now on the Horn of Africa , we &apos;ve been through this before ."
So is this a hopeless cause ?
Absolutely not .
I &apos;d like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope .
"Cameroon , northern Cameroon , boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades ."
Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons .
"Well two years ago , we decided , let &apos;s transform the model of fighting hunger , and instead of giving out the food aid , we put it into food banks ."
"And we said , listen , during the lean season , take the food out ."
"You manage , the village manages these warehouses ."
"And during harvest , put it back with interest , food interest ."
"So add in five percent , 10 percent more food ."
"For the past two years , 500 of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid — they &apos;re self-sufficient ."
And the food banks are growing .
And they &apos;re starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village .
But they &apos;ve never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources .
I love this idea that came from the village level : three keys to unlock that warehouse .
Food is gold there .
"And simple ideas can transform the face , not of small areas , of big areas of the world ."
I &apos;d like to talk about what I call digital food .
Technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine .
"Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize for saying , &quot; &quot; Guess what , famines happen in the presence of food because people have no ability to buy it . &quot; &quot; We certainly saw that in 2008 ."
We &apos;re seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year .
Food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
"Well this picture — I was in Hebron in a small shop , this shop , where instead of bringing in food , we provide digital food , a card ."
It says &quot; &quot; bon appetit &quot; &quot; in Arabic .
And the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items .
"They have to be nutritious , and they have to be locally produced ."
And what &apos;s happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry — where this card &apos;s used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus — the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent .
The shopkeepers are hiring more people .
It is a win-win-win situation that starts the food economy moving .
"We now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways ."
"Perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates , Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly , which is to ask the question : What if , instead of looking at the hungry as victims — and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families — what if we view them as the solution , as the value chain to fight hunger ?"
"What if from the women in Africa who cannot sell any food — there &apos;s no roads , there &apos;s no warehouses , there &apos;s not even a tarp to pick the food up with — what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere ?"
And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries .
And guess what ?
"In virtually every case , when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market — if you say , &quot; &quot; We will buy 300 metric tons of this ."
"We &apos;ll pick it up . We &apos;ll make sure it &apos;s stored properly . &quot; &quot; — their yields have gone up two- , three- , fourfold and they figure it out , because it &apos;s the first guaranteed opportunity they &apos;ve had in their life ."
And we &apos;re seeing people transform their lives .
"Today , food aid , our food aid — huge engine — 80 percent of it is bought in the developing world ."
Total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food .
"Now you &apos;d ask , can this be done at scale ?"
"These are great ideas , village-level ideas ."
"Well I &apos;d like to talk about Brazil , because I &apos;ve taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years , when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now ."
"And what I &apos;ve found is , rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things , they invested in a school feeding program ."
And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .
And they &apos;re doing this at huge scale after President Lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day .
And this zero hunger program costs .5 percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty .
"It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil , and it &apos;s at scale , and it &apos;s creating opportunities ."
I &apos;ve gone out there ; I &apos;ve met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this .
"Now if we look at the economic imperative here , this isn &apos;t just about compassion ."
"The fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger — the cost to society , the burden it has to bear — is on average six percent , and in some countries up to 11 percent , of GDP a year ."
"And if you look at the 36 countries with the highest burden of malnutrition , that &apos;s 260 billion lost from a productive economy every year ."
"Well , the World Bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars — 10.3 — to address malnutrition in those countries ."
"You look at the cost-benefit analysis , and my dream is to take this issue , not just from the compassion argument , but to the finance ministers of the world , and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate , affordable nutrition for all of humanity ."
The amazing thing I &apos;ve found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader .
"When a leader says , &quot; &quot; Not under my watch , &quot; &quot; everything begins to change ."
And the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this .
And the fact that France has put food at the center of the G20 is really important .
"Because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person , nation by nation ."
We have to stand together .
And we &apos;re seeing nations in Africa .
WFP &apos;s been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .
What I would like to offer here is a challenge .
I believe we &apos;re living at a time in human history where it &apos;s just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don &apos;t know where to find a cup of food .
"Not only that , transforming hunger is an opportunity , but I think we have to change our mindsets ."
I am so honored to be here with some of the world &apos;s top innovators and thinkers .
"And I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say , &quot; &quot; No more ."
"No more are we going to accept this . &quot; &quot; And we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted , but that exists no more ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"In the great 1980s movie &quot; &quot; The Blues Brothers , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a scene where John Belushi goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment in Chicago for the very first time ."
"It &apos;s a cramped , tiny space and it &apos;s just three feet away from the train tracks ."
"As John sits on Dan &apos;s bed , a train goes rushing by , rattling everything in the room ."
"John asks , &quot; &quot; How often does that train go by ? &quot; &quot; Dan replies , &quot; &quot; So often , you won &apos;t even notice it . &quot; &quot; And then , something falls off the wall ."
We all know what he &apos;s talking about .
"As human beings , we get used to everyday things really fast ."
"As a product designer , it &apos;s my job to see those everyday things , to feel them , and try to improve upon them ."
"For example , see this piece of fruit ?"
See this little sticker ?
That sticker wasn &apos;t there when I was a kid .
"But somewhere as the years passed , someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit ."
Why ?
So it could be easier for us to check out at the grocery counter .
"Well that &apos;s great , we can get in and out of the store quickly ."
"But now , there &apos;s a new problem ."
"When we get home and we &apos;re hungry and we see this ripe , juicy piece of fruit on the counter , we just want to pick it up and eat it ."
"Except now , we have to look for this little sticker ."
"And dig at it with our nails , damaging the flesh ."
Then rolling up that sticker — you know what I mean .
And then trying to flick it off your fingers .
"( Applause ) It &apos;s not fun , not at all ."
But something interesting happened .
"See the first time you did it , you probably felt those feelings ."
You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
You felt upset .
You just wanted to dive in .
"By the 10th time , you started to become less upset and you just started peeling the label off ."
"By the 100th time , at least for me , I became numb to it ."
"I simply picked up the piece of fruit , dug at it with my nails , tried to flick it off , and then wondered , &quot; Was there another sticker ? &quot;"
So why is that ?
Why do we get used to everyday things ?
"Well as human beings , we have limited brain power ."
And so our brains encode the everyday things we do into habits so we can free up space to learn new things .
"It &apos;s a process called habituation and it &apos;s one of the most basic ways , as humans , we learn ."
"Now , habituation isn &apos;t always bad ."
Remember learning to drive ?
I sure do .
"Your hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel , looking at every single object out there — the cars , the lights , the pedestrians ."
It &apos;s a nerve-wracking experience .
"So much so , that I couldn &apos;t even talk to anyone else in the car and I couldn &apos;t even listen to music ."
But then something interesting happened .
"As the weeks went by , driving became easier and easier ."
You habituated it .
It started to become fun and second nature .
"And then , you could talk to your friends again and listen to music ."
So there &apos;s a good reason why our brains habituate things .
"If we didn &apos;t , we &apos;d notice every little detail , all the time ."
"It would be exhausting , and we &apos;d have no time to learn about new things ."
"But sometimes , habituation isn &apos;t good ."
"If it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us , well , that &apos;s bad ."
"And if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems , well , then that &apos;s really bad ."
Comedians know all about this .
"Jerry Seinfeld &apos;s entire career was built on noticing those little details , those idiotic things we do every day that we don &apos;t even remember ."
He tells us about the time he visited his friends and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower .
"He &apos;d reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way , and it was 100 degrees too hot ."
"And then he &apos;d turn it the other way , and it was 100 degrees too cold ."
He just wanted a comfortable shower .
"Now , we &apos;ve all been there , we just don &apos;t remember it ."
"But Jerry did , and that &apos;s a comedian &apos;s job ."
"But designers , innovators and entrepreneurs , it &apos;s our job to not just notice those things , but to go one step further and try to fix them ."
"See this , this person , this is Mary Anderson ."
"In 1902 in New York City , she was visiting ."
"It was a cold , wet , snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar ."
"As she was going to her destination , she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely ."
"When he opened the window , though , he let all this cold , wet air inside , making all the passengers miserable ."
"Now probably , most of those passengers just thought , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fact of life , he &apos;s got to open the window to clean it ."
That &apos;s just how it is . &quot; &quot; But Mary didn &apos;t .
"Mary thought , &quot; &quot; What if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside so that he could stay safe and drive and the passengers could actually stay warm ? &quot; &quot; So she picked up her sketchbook right then and there , and began drawing what would become the world &apos;s first windshield wiper ."
"Now as a product designer , I try to learn from people like Mary to try to see the world the way it really is , not the way we think it is ."
Why ?
Because it &apos;s easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees .
But it &apos;s hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees .
"Now some people think you &apos;re born with this ability or you &apos;re not , as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly ."
That wasn &apos;t the case for me .
I had to work at it .
"During my years at Apple , Steve Jobs challenged us to come into work every day , to see our products through the eyes of the customer , the new customer , the one that has fears and possible frustrations and hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product could work straightaway for them ."
"He called it staying beginners , and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster , easier and seamless for the new customers ."
So I remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the iPod .
"See , back in the &apos; 90s , being a gadget freak like I am , I would rush out to the store for the very , very latest gadget ."
"I &apos;d take all the time to get to the store , I &apos;d check out , I &apos;d come back home , I &apos;d start to unbox it ."
"And then , there was another little sticker : the one that said , &quot; &quot; Charge before use . &quot; &quot; What !"
I can &apos;t believe it !
I just spent all this time buying this product and now I have to charge before use .
I have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy .
It was crazy .
But you know what ?
Almost every product back then did that .
"When it had batteries in it , you had to charge it before you used it ."
"Well , Steve noticed that and he said , &quot; We &apos;re not going to let that happen to our product . &quot;"
So what did we do ?
"Typically , when you have a product that has a hard drive in it , you run it for about 30 minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive &apos;s going to be working years later for the customer after they pull it out of the box ."
What did we do instead ?
We ran that product for over two hours .
Why ?
"Well , first off , we could make a higher quality product , be easy to test , and make sure it was great for the customer ."
"But most importantly , the battery came fully charged right out of the box , ready to use ."
"So that customer , with all that exhilaration , could just start using the product ."
"It was great , and it worked ."
People liked it .
"Today , almost every product that you get that &apos;s battery powered comes out of the box fully charged , even if it doesn &apos;t have a hard drive ."
"But back then , we noticed that detail and we fixed it , and now everyone else does that as well ."
"No more , &quot; &quot; Charge before use . &quot; &quot; So why am I telling you this ?"
"Well , it &apos;s seeing the invisible problem , not just the obvious problem , that &apos;s important , not just for product design , but for everything we do ."
"You see , there are invisible problems all around us , ones we can solve ."
"But first we need to see them , to feel them ."
"So , I &apos;m hesitant to give you any tips about neuroscience or psychology ."
There &apos;s far too many experienced people in the TED community who would know much more about that than I ever will .
"But let me leave you with a few tips that I do , that we all can do , to fight habituation ."
My first tip is to look broader .
"You see , when you &apos;re tackling a problem , sometimes , there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem ."
"And sometimes , a lot of steps after it ."
"If you can take a step back and look broader , maybe you can change some of those boxes before the problem ."
Maybe you can combine them .
Maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better .
"Take thermostats , for instance ."
"In the 1900s when they first came out , they were really simple to use ."
You could turn them up or turn them down .
People understood them .
"But in the 1970s , the energy crisis struck , and customers started thinking about how to save energy ."
So what happened ?
Thermostat designers decided to add a new step .
"Instead of just turning up and down , you now had to program it ."
So you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time .
Now that seemed great .
Every thermostat had started adding that feature .
But it turned out that no one saved any energy .
"Now , why is that ?"
"Well , people couldn &apos;t predict the future ."
"They just didn &apos;t know how their weeks would change season to season , year to year ."
"So no one was saving energy , and what happened ?"
Thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that programming step .
"They made better U.I.s , they made better documentation ."
"But still , years later , people were not saving any energy because they just couldn &apos;t predict the future ."
So what did we do ?
"We put a machine-learning algorithm in instead of the programming that would simply watch when you turned it up and down , when you liked a certain temperature when you got up , or when you went away ."
And you know what ?
It worked .
People are saving energy without any programming .
"So , it doesn &apos;t matter what you &apos;re doing ."
"If you take a step back and look at all the boxes , maybe there &apos;s a way to remove one or combine them so that you can make that process much simpler ."
So that &apos;s my first tip : look broader .
"For my second tip , it &apos;s to look closer ."
One of my greatest teachers was my grandfather .
He taught me all about the world .
"He taught me how things were built and how they were repaired , the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project ."
"I remember one story he told me about screws , and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job ."
"There are many different screws : wood screws , metal screws , anchors , concrete screws , the list went on and on ."
Our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customs themselves without professionals .
So what did we do ?
"I remembered that story that my grandfather told me , and so we thought , &quot; &quot; How many different screws can we put in the box ?"
"Was it going to be two , three , four , five ?"
"Because there &apos;s so many different wall types . &quot; &quot; So we thought about it , we optimized it , and we came up with three different screws to put in the box ."
We thought that was going to solve the problem .
"But it turned out , it didn &apos;t ."
"So we shipped the product , and people weren &apos;t having a great experience ."
So what did we do ?
We went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn &apos;t get it right .
"And we designed a special screw , a custom screw , much to the chagrin of our investors ."
"They were like , &quot; &quot; Why are you spending so much time on a little screw ?"
"Get out there and sell more ! &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; We will sell more if we get this right . &quot; &quot; And it turned out , we did ."
"With that custom little screw , there was just one screw in the box , that was easy to mount and put on the wall ."
"So if we focus on those tiny details , the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say , &quot; &quot; Are those important or is that the way we &apos;ve always done it ?"
Maybe there &apos;s a way to get rid of those . &quot; &quot; So my last piece of advice is to think younger .
"Every day , I &apos;m confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids ."
"They come up with questions like , &quot; Why can &apos;t cars fly around traffic ? &quot;"
"Or , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t my shoelaces have Velcro instead ? &quot; &quot; Sometimes , those questions are smart ."
"My son came to me the other day and I asked him , &quot; Go run out to the mailbox and check it . &quot;"
"He looked at me , puzzled , and said , &quot; &quot; Why doesn &apos;t the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I was like , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a pretty good question . &quot; &quot; So , they can ask tons of questions and sometimes we find out we just don &apos;t have the right answers ."
"We say , &quot; &quot; Son , that &apos;s just the way the world works . &quot; &quot; So the more we &apos;re exposed to something , the more we get used to it ."
But kids haven &apos;t been around long enough to get used to those things .
"And so when they run into problems , they immediately try to solve them , and sometimes they find a better way , and that way really is better ."
"So my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team , or people with young minds ."
"Because if you have those young minds , they cause everyone in the room to think younger ."
"Picasso once said , &quot; &quot; Every child is an artist ."
"The problem is when he or she grows up , is how to remain an artist . &quot; &quot; We all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time , before a lifetime of habits got in the way ."
"Our challenge is to get back there , to feel that frustration , to see those little details , to look broader , look closer , and to think younger so we can stay beginners ."
It &apos;s not easy .
It requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world .
"But if we do , we could do some pretty amazing things ."
"For me , hopefully , that &apos;s better product design ."
"For you , that could mean something else , something powerful ."
"Our challenge is to wake up each day and say , &quot; How can I experience the world better ? &quot;"
"And if we do , maybe , just maybe , we can get rid of these dumb little stickers ."
Thank you very much .

"Now , if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics , then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country ."
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject .
"And at top of that pyramid , it &apos;s calculus ."
And I &apos;m here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
"that the correct summit — that all of our students , every high school graduate should know — should be statistics : probability and statistics ."
"( Applause ) I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong . Calculus is an important subject ."
It &apos;s one of the great products of the human mind .
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .
"And every student who studies math , science , engineering , economics , they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college ."
"But I &apos;m here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day-to-day lives ."
"On the other hand , statistics — that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . Right ?"
It &apos;s risk . It &apos;s reward . It &apos;s randomness .
It &apos;s understanding data .
"I think if our students , if our high school students — if all of the American citizens — knew about probability and statistics , we wouldn &apos;t be in the economic mess that we &apos;re in today . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Not only — thank you — not only that ..."
"but if it &apos;s taught properly , it can be a lot of fun ."
"I mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling ."
It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
"Look , the world has changed from analog to digital ."
"And it &apos;s time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital , from the more classical , continuous mathematics , to the more modern , discrete mathematics — the mathematics of uncertainty , of randomness , of data — that being probability and statistics ."
"In summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . And I mean it ."
Thank you very much .

So we all have our own biases .
"For example , some of us tend to think that it &apos;s very difficult to transform failing government systems ."
"When we think of government systems , we tend to think that they &apos;re archaic , set in their ways , and perhaps , the leadership is just too bureaucratic to be able to change things ."
"Well , today , I want to challenge that theory ."
I want to tell you a story of a very large government system that has not only put itself on the path of reform but has also shown fairly spectacular results in less than three years .
This is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like .
There are 1 million such schools in India .
"And even for me , who &apos;s lived in India all her life , walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking ."
"By the time kids are 11 , 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover ."
"11-year-olds cannot do simple addition , they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence ."
These are things that you and I would expect an 8-year-old to be able to do .
"By the time kids are 13 or 14 , they tend to drop out of schools ."
"In India , public schools not only offer free education — they offer free textbooks , free workbooks , free meals , sometimes even cash scholarships ."
"And yet , 40 percent of the parents today are choosing to pull their children out of public schools and pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools ."
"As a comparison , in a far richer country , the US , that number is only 10 percent ."
That &apos;s a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is .
So it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 2013 from an absolutely brilliant lady called Surina Rajan .
"She was , at that time , the head of the Department of School Education in a state called Haryana in India ."
"So she said to us , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;ve been heading this department for the last two years ."
"I &apos;ve tried a number of things , and nothing seems to work ."
Can you possibly help ? &quot; &quot; Let me describe Haryana a little bit to you .
Haryana is a state which has 30 million people .
"It has 15,000 public schools and 2 million plus children in those public schools ."
"So basically , with that phone call , I promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself ."
"As I started this project , I was very painfully aware of two things ."
"One , that I had never done anything like this before ."
"And two , many others had , perhaps without too much success ."
"As my colleagues and I looked across the country and across the world , we couldn &apos;t find another example that we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana ."
We knew that we had to craft our own journey .
"But anyway , we jumped right in and as we jumped in , all sorts of ideas started flying at us ."
"People said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s change the way we recruit teachers , let &apos;s hire new principals and train them and send them on international learning tours , let &apos;s put technology inside classrooms . &quot; &quot; By the end of week one , we had 50 ideas on the table , all amazing , all sounded right ."
There was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Hang on , stop ."
"Let &apos;s first at least decide what is it we &apos;re trying to achieve . &quot; &quot; So with a lot of push and pull and debate , Haryana set itself a goal which said : by 2020 , we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge ."
"Now the specifics of the goal don &apos;t matter here , but what matters is how specific the goal is ."
Because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to implement .
"Does this idea support this goal ? If yes , let &apos;s keep it ."
"But if it doesn &apos;t or we &apos;re not sure , then let &apos;s put it aside ."
"As simple as it sounds , having a very specific goal right up front has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused in our transformation journey ."
"And looking back over the last two and a half years , that has been a huge positive for us ."
"So we had the goal , and now we needed to figure out what are the issues , what is broken ."
"Before we went into schools , a lot of people told us that education quality is poor because either the teachers are lazy , they don &apos;t come into schools , or they &apos;re incapable , they actually don &apos;t know how to teach ."
"Well , when we went inside schools , we found something completely different ."
"On most days , most teachers were actually inside schools ."
"And when you spoke with them , you realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes ."
But they were not teaching .
I went to a school where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom and a toilet supervised .
I went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids &apos; accounts .
"At lunchtime , most teachers were spending all of their time getting the midday meal cooking , supervised and served to the students ."
"So we asked the teachers , &quot; What &apos;s going on , why are you not teaching ? &quot;"
"And they said , &quot; &quot; This is what &apos;s expected of us ."
"When a supervisor comes to visit us , these are exactly the things that he checks ."
"Has the toilet been made , has the meal been served ."
"When my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters , these are exactly the things which are discussed . &quot; &quot; You see , what had happened was , over the last two decades , India had been fighting the challenge of access , having enough schools , and enrollment , bringing children into the schools ."
"So the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges , and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs ."
"Not explicitly , but implicitly ."
"And now , what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attendance but to tell them that what is most important is for them to go back inside classrooms and teach ."
They needed to be monitored and measured and awarded on the quality of teaching and not on all sorts of other things .
"So as we went through the education system , as we delved into it deeper , we found a few such core root causes which were determining , which were shaping how people behaved in the system ."
"And we realized that unless we change those specific things , we could do a number of other things ."
"We could train , we could put technology into schools , but the system wouldn &apos;t change ."
And addressing these non-obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
"So , we had the goal and we had the issues , and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were ."
"We obviously did not want to recreate the wheel , so we said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s look around and see what we can find . &quot; &quot; And we found these beautiful , small pilot experiments all over the country and all over the world ."
"Small things being done by NGOs , being done by foundations ."
But what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled .
"All of them were limited to 50 , 100 or 500 schools ."
"And here , we were looking for a solution for 15,000 schools ."
"So we looked into why , if these things actually work , why don &apos;t they actually scale ?"
"What happens is that when a typical NGO comes in , they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources ."
"So they might bring in money , they might bring in people , they might bring in technology ."
"And in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in , those additional resources actually create a difference ."
"But now imagine that the head of this NGO goes to the head of the School Education Department and says , &quot; &quot; Hey , now let &apos;s do this for 15,000 schools . &quot; &quot; Where is that guy or girl going to find the money to actually scale this up to 15,000 schools ?"
"He doesn &apos;t have the additional money , he doesn &apos;t have the resources ."
"And hence , innovations don &apos;t scale ."
"So right at the beginning of the project , what we said was , &quot; &quot; Whatever we have to do has to be scalable , it has to work in all 15,000 schools . &quot; &quot; And hence , it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has ."
Much easier said than done .
( Laughter ) I think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me .
"We spent a lot of long hours in office , in cafés , sometimes even in bars , scratching out heads and saying , &quot; Where are the solutions , how are we going to solve this problem ? &quot;"
"In the end , I think we did find solutions to many of the issues ."
I &apos;ll give you an example .
"In the context of effective learning , one of the things people talk about is hands-on learning ."
"Children shouldn &apos;t memorize things from books , they should do activities , and that &apos;s a more effective way to learn ."
"Which basically means giving students things like beads , learning rods , abacuses ."
"But we did not have the budgets to give that to 15,000 schools , 2 million children ."
We needed another solution .
We couldn &apos;t think of anything .
"One day , one of our team members went to a school and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students ."
That was a huge eureka moment for us .
"So what happens now in the textbooks in Haryana is that after every concept , we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say , &quot; &quot; To teach this concept , here &apos;s an activity that you can do ."
"And by the way , in order to actually do this activity , here are things that you can use from your immediate environment , whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside , which can be used as learning aids for kids . &quot; &quot; And we see teachers all over Haryana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students ."
"So in this way , whatever we designed , we were actually able to implement it across all 15,000 schools from day one ."
"Now , this brings me to my last point ."
"How do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers ?"
The department used to have a process which is very interesting .
"I like to call it &quot; &quot; The Chain of Hope . &quot; &quot; They would write a letter from the headquarters and send it to the next level , which was the district offices ."
"They would hope that in each of these district offices , an officer would get the letter , would open it , read it and then forward it to the next level , which was the block offices ."
"And then you would hope that at the block office , somebody else got the letter , opened it , read it and forwarded it eventually to the 15,000 principals ."
"And then one would hope that the principals got the letter , received it , understood it and started implementing it ."
It was a little bit ridiculous .
"Now , we knew technology was the answer , but we also knew that most of these schools don &apos;t have a computer or email ."
"However , what the teachers do have are smartphones ."
"They &apos;re constantly on SMS , on Facebook and on WhatsApp ."
"So what now happens in Haryana is , all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups and anytime something needs to be communicated , it &apos;s just posted across all WhatsApp groups ."
It spreads like wildfire .
"You can immediately check who has received it , who has read it ."
Teachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously .
"And what &apos;s interesting is , it &apos;s not just the headquarters who are answering these questions ."
Another teacher from a completely different part of the state will stand up and answer the question .
"Everybody &apos;s acting as everybody &apos;s peer group , and things are getting implemented ."
"So today , when you go to a school in Haryana , things look different ."
"The teachers are back inside classrooms , they &apos;re teaching ."
Often with innovative techniques .
"When a supervisor comes to visit the classroom , he or she not only checks the construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teaching ."
"Once a quarter , all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded ."
And schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult conversations .
"Of course , they also get additional support to be able to do better in the future ."
"In the context of education , it &apos;s very difficult to see results quickly ."
"When people talk about systemic , large-scale change , they talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years ."
But not in Haryana .
"In the last one year , there have been three independent studies , all measuring student learning outcomes , which indicate that something fundamental , something unique is happening in Haryana ."
"Learning levels of children have stopped declining , and they have started going up ."
"Haryana is one of the few states in the country which is showing an improvement , and certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement ."
"These are still early signs , there &apos;s a long way to go , but this gives us a lot of hope for the future ."
"I recently went to a school , and as I was leaving , I ran into a lady , her name was Parvati , she was the mother of a child , and she was smiling ."
I certainly believe so .
"I think if you give them the right levers , they can move mountains ."
Forrest North : The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation .
And I would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with .
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state with too much time on my hands .
Yves Behar : And in scenic Switzerland for me .
FN : I always had a passion for alternative vehicles .
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada .
YB : Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there .
FN : And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
"This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil that I built in my bedroom , much to the dismay of my mother ."
"YB : To the dismay of my mother , this is dangerous teenage fashion right there ."
"( Laughter ) FN : And I brought this all together , this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia — also the U.S. and Japan ."
"YB : So , wind power , solar power — we had a lot to talk about ."
We had a lot that got us excited .
So we decided to do a special project together .
To combine engineering and design and ...
"FN : Really make a fully integrated product , something beautiful ."
YB : And we made a baby .
( Laughter ) FN : Can you bring out our baby ?
( Applause ) This baby is fully electric .
It goes 150 miles an hour .
It &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design .
It &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar .
He came up with our name and logo . We &apos;re Mission Motors .
"And we &apos;ve only got three minutes , but we could talk about it for hours ."
YB : Thank you .
"FN : Thank you TED . And thank you Chris , for having us ."

I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after 23 years of service .
"The majority of those 23 years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County , which includes the Golden Gate Bridge ."
"The bridge is an iconic structure , known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean , and its inspiring architecture ."
"Unfortunately , it is also a magnet for suicide , being one of the most utilized sites in the world ."
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937 .
"Joseph Strauss , chief engineer in charge of building the bridge , was quoted as saying , &quot; &quot; The bridge is practically suicide-proof ."
"Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension — this bridge has been romanticized as such — that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief , and the waters below will cleanse your soul ."
But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide .
"After a free fall of four to five seconds , the body strikes the water at about 75 miles an hour ."
"That impact shatters bones , some of which then puncture vital organs ."
Most die on impact .
"Those that don &apos;t generally flail in the water helplessly , and then drown ."
I don &apos;t think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face .
This is the cord .
"Except for around the two towers , there is 32 inches of steel paralleling the bridge ."
This is where most folks stand before taking their lives .
I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life .
I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail .
"When I first began working on the bridge , we had no formal training ."
You struggled to funnel your way through these calls .
"This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide , but to the officers as well ."
"We &apos;ve come a long , long way since then ."
"Now , veteran officers and psychologists train new officers ."
This is Jason Garber .
I met Jason on July 22 of last year when I get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near midspan .
"I responded , and when I arrived , I observed Jason speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer ."
Jason was just 32 years old and had flown out here from New Jersey .
"As a matter of fact , he had flown out here on two other occasions from New Jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge ."
"After about an hour of speaking with Jason , he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora &apos;s box ."
"Recalling your Greek mythology , Zeus created Pandora , and sent her down to Earth with a box , and told her , &quot; &quot; Never , ever open that box . &quot; &quot; Well one day , curiosity got the better of Pandora , and she did open the box ."
"Out flew plagues , sorrows , and all sorts of evils against man ."
The only good thing in the box was hope .
"Jason then asked us , &quot; &quot; What happens when you open the box and hope isn &apos;t there ? &quot; &quot; He paused a few moments , leaned to his right , and was gone ."
"This kind , intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide ."
Jason &apos;s parents had asked him to do so .
The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people .
"I pose these questions to you : What would you do if your family member , friend or loved one was suicidal ?"
What would you say ?
Would you know what to say ?
"In my experience , it &apos;s not just the talking that you do , but the listening ."
Listen to understand .
"Don &apos;t argue , blame , or tell the person you know how they feel , because you probably don &apos;t ."
"By just being there , you may just be the turning point that they need ."
One way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; &quot; Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot; &quot; Confronting the person head-on may just save their life and be the turning point for them .
"Some other signs to look for : hopelessness , believing that things are terrible and never going to get better ; helplessness , believing that there is nothing that you can do about it ; recent social withdrawal ; and a loss of interest in life ."
"I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago , and I received an email from a lady that I &apos;d like to read you her letter ."
"She lost her son on January 19 of this year , and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago , and it &apos;s with her permission and blessing that I read this to you ."
"&quot; &quot; Hi , Kevin . I imagine you &apos;re at the TED Conference ."
That must be quite the experience to be there .
I &apos;m thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend .
Just wanted to drop you a note .
"Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc ."
"I &apos;m still pretty numb , but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn &apos;t coming home ."
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the 49ers game with his father on January 19 .
He never made it there .
I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening .
"The next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that Mike &apos;s car was down at the bridge ."
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1 : 58 p.m. the previous day .
Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves .
Who hasn &apos;t been low before without suffering from a true mental illness ?
It shouldn &apos;t be so easy to end it .
My prayers are with you for your fight .
"The GGB , Golden Gate Bridge , is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay , not a graveyard ."
"Good luck this week . Vicky . &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day , and also the courage just to carry on ."
I &apos;d like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage .
"On March 11 of 2005 , I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower ."
"For the next hour and a half , I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness ."
Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance .
"When Kevin came back over , I congratulated him ."
"&quot; This is a new beginning , a new life . &quot;"
"But I asked him , &quot; &quot; What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance ? &quot; &quot; And you know what he told me ?"
"He said , &quot; &quot; You listened ."
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help .
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated .
"I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old , completely unaware of any hereditary traits , but , thank God , now we know ."
"Kevin is straight , as he says ."
We truly thank God for you .
"Boy , did I have to straighten that one out . &quot; &quot; Today , Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society ."
He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others .
Suicide is not just something I &apos;ve encountered on the job .
It &apos;s personal .
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning .
"That act , although ending his own pain , robbed me from ever getting to know him ."
This is what suicide does .
"For most suicidal folks , or those contemplating suicide , they wouldn &apos;t think of hurting another person ."
They just want their own pain to end .
"Typically , this is accomplished in just three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol , or death ."
"In my career , I &apos;ve responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge ."
"Of those incidents I &apos;ve been directly involved with , I &apos;ve only lost two , but that &apos;s two too many ."
One was Jason .
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour .
"During that time , he shook my hand on three occasions ."
"On that final handshake , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; Kevin , I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go . &quot;"
And he leapt .
"Horrible , absolutely horrible ."
"I do want to tell you , though , the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide ."
"I tell people , the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco , but people together also ."
"That connection , or bridge that we make , is something that each and every one of us should strive to do ."
Suicide is preventable .
There is help . There is hope .
Thank you very much .

"I study the future of crime and terrorism , and frankly , I &apos;m afraid ."
I &apos;m afraid by what I see .
"I sincerely want to believe that technology can bring us the techno-utopia that we &apos;ve been promised , but , you see , I &apos;ve spent a career in law enforcement , and that &apos;s informed my perspective on things ."
"I &apos;ve been a street police officer , an undercover investigator , a counter-terrorism strategist , and I &apos;ve worked in more than 70 countries around the world ."
"I &apos;ve had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society , and that &apos;s informed my opinions ."
My work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational .
"They have taught me a lot , and I &apos;d like to be able to share some of these observations with you ."
"Today I &apos;m going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at , the ones that we love ."
"In the hands of the TED community , these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world , but in the hands of suicide bombers , the future can look quite different ."
I started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer .
"In those days , this was the height of technology ."
"Laugh though you will , all the drug dealers and gang members with whom I dealt had one of these long before any police officer I knew did ."
"Twenty years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they &apos;re also building their own mobile phone networks , like this one , which has been deployed in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos ."
They have a national encrypted radio communications system .
Think about that .
Think about the innovation that went into that .
Think about the infrastructure to build it .
And then think about this : Why can &apos;t I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco ? ( Laughter ) How is this possible ? ( Laughter ) It makes no sense . ( Applause ) We consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do .
"Technology has made our world increasingly open , and for the most part , that &apos;s great , but all of this openness may have unintended consequences ."
Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai .
"The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK-47s , explosives and hand grenades ."
They threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes and waited to catch trains on their way home from work .
But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations .
Guns and bombs are nothing new .
What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them .
They were armed with mobile phones .
They had BlackBerries .
They had access to satellite imagery .
"They had satellite phones , and they even had night vision goggles ."
But perhaps their greatest innovation was this .
We &apos;ve all seen pictures like this on television and in the news . This is an operations center .
"And the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in Pakistan , where they monitored the BBC , al Jazeera , CNN and Indian local stations ."
They also monitored the Internet and social media to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed .
They did all of this in real time .
The innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government .
What did they do with this ?
They used it to great effect .
"At one point during the 60-hour siege , the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims ."
"They came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed ."
"And they said to him , &quot; &quot; Who are you , and what are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And the man replied , &quot; I &apos;m just an innocent schoolteacher . &quot;"
"Of course , the terrorists knew that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj ."
"They picked up his identification , and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room , where the terrorist war room Googled him , and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said , &quot; &quot; Your hostage , is he heavyset ?"
"Is he bald in front ? Does he wear glasses ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , yes , yes , &quot; &quot; came the answers ."
The op center had found him and they had a match .
He was not a schoolteacher .
"He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India , and after discovering this information , the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai ."
"( &quot; &quot; Kill him . &quot; &quot; ) We all worry about our privacy settings on Facebook , but the fact of the matter is , our openness can be used against us ."
Terrorists are doing this .
A search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die .
This is the world that we live in .
"During the Mumbai siege , terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand , they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand ."
"In the end , 300 people were gravely wounded and over 172 men , women and children lost their lives that day ."
Think about what happened .
"During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill ."
"Ten people brought 20 million people to a standstill , and this traveled around the world ."
This is what radicals can do with openness .
This was done nearly four years ago .
What could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have ?
What will they do tomorrow ?
"The ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially , and it &apos;s scaling for good and it &apos;s scaling for evil ."
"It &apos;s not just about terrorism , though ."
There &apos;s also been a big paradigm shift in crime .
"You see , you can now commit more crime as well ."
"In the old days , it was a knife and a gun ."
Then criminals moved to robbing trains .
"You could rob 200 people on a train , a great innovation ."
"Moving forward , the Internet allowed things to scale even more ."
"In fact , many of you will remember the recent Sony PlayStation hack ."
"In that incident , over 100 million people were robbed ."
Think about that .
When in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob 100 million ?
"Of course , it &apos;s not just about stealing things ."
There are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit .
"Many of you will remember this super cute video from the last TED , but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute ."
They don &apos;t all have drumsticks .
"Some can be armed with HD cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters , or , as in this little bit of movie magic , quadcopters can be loaded with firearms and automatic weapons ."
Little robots are cute when they play music to you .
"When they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you , a little bit less so ."
"Of course , criminals and terrorists weren &apos;t the first to give guns to robots . We know where that started ."
But they &apos;re adapting quickly .
"Recently , the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States , who was planning on using these remote-controlled drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives into government buildings in the United States ."
"By the way , these travel at over 600 miles an hour ."
"Every time a new technology is being introduced , criminals are there to exploit it ."
We &apos;ve all seen 3D printers .
We know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and even concrete .
"With great precision I actually was able to make this just the other day , a very cute little ducky ."
"But I wonder to myself , for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up , how might they use 3D printers ?"
Perhaps like this .
"You see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too ."
The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws .
You needn &apos;t bring the gun into the UK anymore .
"You just bring the 3D printer and print the gun while you &apos;re here , and , of course , the magazines for your bullets ."
"But as these get bigger in the future , what other items will you be able to print ?"
The technologies are allowing bigger printers .
"As we move forward , we &apos;ll see new technologies also , like the Internet of Things ."
"Every day we &apos;re connecting more and more of our lives to the Internet , which means that the Internet of Things will soon be the Internet of Things To Be Hacked ."
"All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies , and that has a radical implication for our security , because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities ."
Criminals understand this .
Terrorists understand this . Hackers understand this .
"If you control the code , you control the world ."
This is the future that awaits us .
There has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn &apos;t been hacked .
"That &apos;s troubling , since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology ."
"As we &apos;ve seen here , we &apos;re transforming ourselves into cyborgs ."
"Every year , thousands of cochlear implants , diabetic pumps , pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people ."
"In the United States , there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet ."
The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it .
"But if you don &apos;t need it , and somebody else gives you the shock , it &apos;s not a good thing ."
"Of course , we &apos;re going to go even deeper than the human body ."
We &apos;re going down to the cellular level these days .
"Up until this point , all the technologies I &apos;ve been talking about have been silicon-based , ones and zeroes , but there &apos;s another operating system out there : the original operating system , DNA ."
"And to hackers , DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked ."
It &apos;s a great challenge for them .
"There are people already working on hacking the software of life , and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all , some won &apos;t be ."
So how will criminals abuse this ?
"Well , with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things ."
"For example , I predict that we will move away from a plant-based narcotics world to a synthetic one . Why do you need the plants anymore ?"
"You can just take the DNA code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast , and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you , or the marijuana , or any other drug ."
So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting .
"In fact , we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century ."
The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously .
"It was proceeding at Moore &apos;s Law pace , but then in 2008 , something changed ."
"The technologies got better , and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of Moore &apos;s Law ."
That has significant implications for us .
"It took us 30 years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today , but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly , and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do , we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future ."
"It will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio-virus , enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax , weaponized flu ."
We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent .
"It already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it , but it &apos;s hard to get ."
"Engineers , by moving around a small number of genetic changes , were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch , so that not thousands of people would die , but tens of millions ."
"You see , you can go ahead and create new pandemics , and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments , they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this and get access to this information ."
But it goes deeper than that .
"DNA researcher Andrew Hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments , modern cancer treatments , to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact , then you can also go after any one person &apos;s cell ."
"Personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons , which means you can attack any one individual , including all the people in this picture ."
How will we protect them in the future ?
What to do ? What to do about all this ?
That &apos;s what I get asked all the time .
"For those of you who follow me on Twitter , I will be tweeting out the answer later on today . ( Laughter ) Actually , it &apos;s a bit more complex than that , and there are no magic bullets ."
"I don &apos;t have all the answers , but I know a few things ."
"In the wake of 9 / 11 , the best security minds put together all their innovation and this is what they created for security ."
"If you &apos;re expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse — ( Laughter ) — uh , you may want to have a backup plan . ( Laughter ) Just saying . Just think about that . ( Applause ) Law enforcement is currently a closed system ."
"It &apos;s nation-based , while the threat is international ."
"Policing doesn &apos;t scale globally . At least , it hasn &apos;t , and our current system of guns , border guards , big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we &apos;re moving ."
"So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats , like attacking a president or a prime minister ?"
"This would be the natural government response , to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles ."
But this is not going to work .
The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial .
Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future .
So maybe there &apos;s a more radical way that we can look at this .
"What happens if we were to take the President &apos;s DNA , or a king or queen &apos;s , and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that DNA and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders ?"
Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand ?
"Or , controversially , and not without its risks , what happens if we just gave it to the whole public ?"
Then we could all be engaged in helping .
We &apos;ve already seen examples of this working well .
"The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd-sourcing what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world , and , in a more dramatic case , we &apos;ve seen in Mexico , a country that has been racked by 50,000 narcotics-related murders in the past six years ."
They &apos;re killing so many people they can &apos;t even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez .
What can we do about this ? The government has proven ineffective .
"So in Mexico , citizens , at great risk to themselves , are fighting back to build an effective solution ."
They &apos;re crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers .
"Whether or not you realize it , we are at the dawn of a technological arms race , an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill ."
"The threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now ."
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
"My personal belief is that , rather than having a small , elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all , we &apos;re much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do ."
"If we all do our part , I think we &apos;ll be in a much better space ."
The tools to change the world are in everybody &apos;s hands .
"How we use them is not just up to me , it &apos;s up to all of us ."
This was a technology I would frequently deploy as a police officer .
This technology has become outdated in our current world .
"It doesn &apos;t scale , it doesn &apos;t work globally , and it surely doesn &apos;t work virtually ."
We &apos;ve seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism .
They call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement .
So I invite you to join me .
"After all , public safety is too important to leave to the professionals ."
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"The question is , Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown ?"
"Now I know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture — The X prize , the X-Files , Project X , TEDx ."
Where &apos;d that come from ?
"About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language ."
"To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation , because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks .
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
And al-jebr roughly translates to &quot; the system for reconciling disparate parts . &quot;
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe — which is to say Spain — in the 11th and 12th centuries .
And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don &apos;t make it through a European voice box without lots of practice .
Trust me on that one .
"Also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages ."
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
"This is the letter SHeen , and it makes the sound we think of as SH — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some undefined , unknown thing ."
"Now in Arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al-shalan — the unknown thing ."
"And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century derivation of proofs ."
"The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can &apos;t be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn &apos;t have that SH , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai ."
"Later when this material was translated into a common European language , which is to say Latin , they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X."
"And once that happened , once this material was in Latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ? X is the unknown
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in Spanish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was worth sharing .

But he did .
"On a Thursday morning in July 2005 , the bomber and I , unknowingly , boarded the same train carriage at the same time , standing , apparently , just feet apart ."
I didn &apos;t see him .
"Actually , I didn &apos;t see anyone ."
"You know not to look at anyone on the Tube , but I guess he saw me ."
I &apos;ve often wondered : What was he thinking ?
Especially in those final seconds .
"He didn &apos;t set out to kill or maim me , Gill Hicks ."
I mean — he didn &apos;t know me .
No .
"Instead , he gave me an unwarranted and an unwanted label ."
I had become the enemy .
"To him , I was the &quot; &quot; other , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; them , &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; us . &quot; &quot; The label &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; allowed him to dehumanize us ."
It allowed him to push that button .
And he wasn &apos;t selective .
"Twenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone , and I was almost one of them ."
"In the time it takes to draw a breath , we were plunged into a darkness so immense that it was almost tangible ; what I imagine wading through tar might be like ."
We didn &apos;t know we were the enemy .
"But in the lifting of the darkness , we were reaching out ."
We were helping each other .
"We were calling out our names , a little bit like a roll call , waiting for responses ."
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m Gill . I &apos;m here .
I &apos;m alive .
OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m Gill .
Here .
Alive .
OK . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know Alison .
But I listened for her check-ins every few minutes .
I didn &apos;t know Richard .
But it mattered to me that he survived .
All I shared with them was my first name .
They didn &apos;t know that I was a head of a department at the Design Council .
"And here is my beloved briefcase , also rescued from that morning ."
"They didn &apos;t know that I published architecture and design journals , that I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts , that I wore black — still do — that I smoked cigarillos ."
I don &apos;t smoke cigarillos anymore .
I was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London .
And I wasn &apos;t ready for that all to end .
"I was so determined to survive that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs , and I just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone ."
I lowered my breathing rate .
I elevated my thighs .
I held myself upright and I fought the urge to close my eyes .
"I held on for almost an hour , an hour to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point ."
Perhaps I should have done more .
"Perhaps I could have lived more , seen more ."
"Maybe I should have gone running , dancing , taken up yoga ."
But my priority and my focus was always my work .
I lived to work .
Who I was on my business card mattered to me .
But it didn &apos;t matter down in that tunnel .
"By the time I felt that first touch from one of my rescuers , I was unable to speak , unable to say even a small word , like &quot; &quot; Gill . &quot; &quot; I surrendered my body to them ."
"I had done all I possibly could , and now I was in their hands ."
"I understood just who and what humanity really is , when I first saw the ID tag that was given to me when I was admitted to hospital ."
And it read : &quot; One unknown estimated female . &quot; One unknown estimated female .
"was that my life was saved , purely because I was a human being ."
"Difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go to save my life , to save as many unknowns as they could , and putting their own lives at risk ."
"To them , it didn &apos;t matter if I was rich or poor , the color of my skin , whether I was male or female , my sexual orientation , who I voted for , whether I was educated , if I had a faith or no faith at all ."
Nothing mattered other than I was a precious human life .
I see myself as a living fact .
"I am proof that unconditional love and respect can not only save , but it can transform lives ."
"Here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers , Andy , and I taken just last year ."
"Ten years after the event , and here we are , arm in arm ."
My face was stroked gently .
What did I feel ?
I felt loved .
"What &apos;s shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution , what &apos;s given me the courage to say : this ends with me is love ."
I was loved .
I know the brilliance of humanity .
"Does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species , as human beings ?"
And when will we embrace the wisdom of our era to rise above mere tolerance and move to an acceptance for all who are only a label until we know them ?
Thank you .

"In the year 1901 , a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt ."
Auguste was delusional and couldn &apos;t remember even the most basic details of her life .
Her doctor was called Alois .
"Alois didn &apos;t know how to help Auguste , but he watched over her until , sadly , she passed away in 1906 ."
"After she died , Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste &apos;s brain — the likes of which he &apos;d never seen before ."
Now here &apos;s the even more striking thing .
"If Auguste had instead been alive today , we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago ."
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer .
And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
"Since 1901 , medicine has advanced greatly ."
"We &apos;ve discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections , many treatments for cancer , antiretrovirals for HIV , statins for heart disease and much more ."
But we &apos;ve made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I &apos;m part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer &apos;s for over a decade .
So I think about this all the time .
Alzheimer &apos;s now affects 40 million people worldwide .
"But by 2050 , it will affect 150 million people — which , by the way , will include many of you ."
"If you &apos;re hoping to live to be 85 or older , your chance of getting Alzheimer &apos;s will be almost one in two ."
"In other words , odds are you &apos;ll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer &apos;s ."
"Already in the United States alone , Alzheimer &apos;s care costs 200 billion dollars every year ."
One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer &apos;s .
"It is today the most expensive disease , and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050 , as the baby boomer generation ages ."
"It may surprise you that , put simply , Alzheimer &apos;s is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation ."
But we &apos;ve done relatively little to address it .
"Today , of the top 10 causes of death worldwide , Alzheimer &apos;s is the only one we cannot prevent , cure or even slow down ."
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer &apos;s than other diseases because we &apos;ve invested less time and money into researching it .
The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer &apos;s despite the fact that Alzheimer &apos;s costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer .
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause : a lack of awareness .
"Because here &apos;s what few people know but everyone should : Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease , and we can cure it ."
"For most of the past 114 years , everyone , including scientists , mistakenly confused Alzheimer &apos;s with aging ."
We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old .
But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer &apos;s patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
"As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer &apos;s significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal ."
Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste &apos;s brain a century ago .
"For almost a century , we didn &apos;t know much about these ."
Today we know they &apos;re made from protein molecules .
You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami .
There are spots on the paper that are sticky .
"And when it folds correctly , these sticky bits end up on the inside ."
"But sometimes things go wrong , and some sticky bits are on the outside ."
"This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other , forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles ."
That &apos;s what we see in the brains of Alzheimer &apos;s patients .
We &apos;ve spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works .
"There are many steps , and identifying which step to try to block is complex — like defusing a bomb ."
Cutting one wire might do nothing .
Cutting others might make the bomb explore .
"We have to find the right step to block , and then create a drug that does it ."
"Until recently , we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best ."
"But now we &apos;ve got together a diverse group of people — medics , biologists , geneticists , chemists , physicists , engineers and mathematicians ."
"And together , we &apos;ve managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease ."
Now let me show you some of our latest results .
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
Let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
"So these are healthy worms , and you can see they &apos;re moving around normally ."
"These worms , on the other hand , have protein molecules sticking together inside them — like humans with Alzheimer &apos;s ."
And you can see they &apos;re clearly sick .
"But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage , then we see that they &apos;re healthy , and they live a normal lifespan ."
"This is just an initial positive result , but research like this shows us that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease that we can understand and we can cure ."
"After 114 years of waiting , there &apos;s finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years ."
"But to grow that hope , to finally beat Alzheimer &apos;s , we need help ."
This isn &apos;t about scientists like me — it &apos;s about you .
"We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease and that if we try , we can beat it ."
"In the case of other diseases , patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments , the pharmaceutical industry , scientists and regulators ."
That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s .
"Today , we see that same drive to beat cancer ."
But Alzheimer &apos;s patients are often unable to speak up for themselves .
"And their families , the hidden victims , caring for their loved ones night and day , are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change ."
"So , it really is down to you ."
"Alzheimer &apos;s isn &apos;t , for the most part , a genetic disease ."
Everyone with a brain is at risk .
"Today , there are 40 million patients like Auguste , who can &apos;t create the change they need for themselves ."
"Help speak up for them , and help demand a cure ."
Thank you .

Here &apos;s a question we need to rethink together : What should be the role of money and markets in our societies ?
"Today , there are very few things that money can &apos;t buy ."
"If you &apos;re sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara , California , you should know that if you don &apos;t like the standard accommodations , you can buy a prison cell upgrade ."
"It &apos;s true . For how much , do you think ?"
What would you guess ?
Five hundred dollars ?
It &apos;s not the Ritz-Carlton . It &apos;s a jail !
Eighty-two dollars a night . Eighty-two dollars a night .
If you go to an amusement park
"and don &apos;t want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides , there is now a solution ."
"In many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line ."
They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets .
And this isn &apos;t only happening in amusement parks .
"In Washington , D.C. , long lines , queues sometimes form for important Congressional hearings ."
"Now some people don &apos;t like to wait in long queues , maybe overnight , even in the rain ."
"So now , for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don &apos;t like to wait , there are companies , line-standing companies , and you can go to them ."
"You can pay them a certain amount of money , they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes , and the lobbyist , just before the hearing begins , can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room ."
Paid line standing .
"It &apos;s happening , the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions , in bigger arenas ."
Take the way we fight our wars .
"Did you know that , in Iraq and Afghanistan , there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were U.S. military troops ?"
"Now this isn &apos;t because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies , but this is what has happened ."
"Over the past three decades , we have lived through a quiet revolution ."
We &apos;ve drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies .
"The difference is this : A market economy is a tool , a valuable and effective tool , for organizing productive activity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale ."
"It &apos;s a way of life , in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life : personal relations , family life , health , education , politics , law , civic life ."
"Now , why worry ? Why worry about our becoming market societies ?"
"For two reasons , I think ."
One of them has to do with inequality .
"The more things money can buy , the more affluence , or the lack of it , matters ."
"If the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs , then inequality wouldn &apos;t matter very much ."
"But when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life — decent health care , access to the best education , political voice and influence in campaigns — when money comes to govern all of those things , inequality matters a great deal ."
And so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence .
That &apos;s one reason to worry .
"There &apos;s a second reason apart from the worry about inequality , and it &apos;s this : with some social goods and practices , when market thinking and market values enter , they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about ."
"I &apos;d like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism , a cash incentive , and see what you think about it ."
"Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids , especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds , to study hard , to do well in school , to apply themselves ."
Some economists have proposed a market solution : Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books .
"They &apos;ve tried this , actually ."
They &apos;ve done some experiments in some major American cities .
"In New York , in Chicago , in Washington , D.C. , they &apos;ve tried this , offering 50 dollars for an A , 35 dollars for a B."
"In Dallas , Texas , they have a program that offers eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read ."
"So let &apos;s see what — Some people are in favor , some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement ."
Let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
"Imagine that you are the head of a major school system , and someone comes to you with this proposal ."
And let &apos;s say it &apos;s a foundation . They will provide the funds .
You don &apos;t have to take it out of your budget .
How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try ?
Let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
"First , how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work ? Raise your hand ."
"And how many would be opposed ? How many would — So the majority here are opposed , but a sizable minority are in favor ."
Let &apos;s have a discussion .
"Let &apos;s start with those of you who object , who would rule it out even before trying ."
What would be your reason ?
Who will get our discussion started ? Yes ?
"Heike Moses : Hello everyone , I &apos;m Heike , and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation , so in the respect that children , if they would like to read , you just take this incentive away in just paying them , so it just changes behavior ."
Michael Sandel : Takes the intrinsic incentive away .
"What is , or should be , the intrinsic motivation ?"
"HM : Well , the intrinsic motivation should be to learn ."
MS : To learn . HM : To get to know the world .
"And then , if you stop paying them , what happens then ?"
Then they stop reading ?
"MS : Now , let &apos;s see if there &apos;s someone who favors , who thinks it &apos;s worth trying this ."
"Elizabeth Loftus : I &apos;m Elizabeth Loftus , and you said worth a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?"
MS : And measure . And what would you measure ?
You &apos;d measure how many — EL : How many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them .
"MS : Oh , after you stopped paying ."
"All right , what about that ?"
"HM : To be frank , I just think this is , not to offend anyone , a very American way ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) MS : All right . What &apos;s emerged from this discussion is the following question : Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation , the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey , which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes ?"
"And people disagree about what the effect will be , but that seems to be the question , that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson , and if it does , what will become of these children later ?"
I should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experiments .
"The cash for good grades has had very mixed results , for the most part has not resulted in higher grades ."
The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books .
It also led them to read shorter books .
"( Laughter ) But the real question is , what will become of these kids later ?"
"Will they have learned that reading is a chore , a form of piecework to be done for pay , that &apos;s the worry , or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake ?"
"Now , what this , even this brief debate , brings out is something that many economists overlook ."
"Economists often assume that markets are inert , that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange ."
"Market exchange , they assume , doesn &apos;t change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged ."
This may be true enough if we &apos;re talking about material goods .
"If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift , it will be the same good ."
It will work the same either way .
But the same may not be true if we &apos;re talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life .
"In those domains , bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about ."
"Once we see that markets and commerce , when extended beyond the material domain , can change the character of the goods themselves , can change the meaning of the social practices , as in the example of teaching and learning , we have to ask where markets belong and where they don &apos;t , where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about ."
"But to have this debate , we have to do something we &apos;re not very good at , and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize , from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning to civic life ."
"Now these are controversial questions , and so we tend to shrink from them ."
"In fact , during the past three decades , when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige , our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out , empty of larger moral meaning ."
"For fear of disagreement , we shrink from these questions ."
"But once we see that markets change the character of goods , we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods ."
"One of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality , the sense that we are all in it together ."
"Against the background of rising inequality , marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives ."
We live and work and shop and play in different places .
Our children go to different schools .
"This isn &apos;t good for democracy , nor is it a satisfying way to live , even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line ."
Here &apos;s why .
"Democracy does not require perfect equality , but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life ."
"What matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another , bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life , because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences ."
And this is how we come to care for the common good .
"And so , in the end , the question of markets is not mainly an economic question ."
It &apos;s really a question of how we want to live together .
"Do we want a society where everything is up for sale , or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy ?"
Thank you very much .

"When I was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school ."
"And as a special treat , he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands ."
"And there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the powerhouse of the human body , sitting in my hands ."
"And that day I knew that when I grew up , I was going to become a brain doctor , scientist , something or the other ."
"Years later , when I finally grew up , my dream came true ."
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I &apos;d like to share with you all today .
"It is estimated that one in six children , that &apos;s one in six children , suffer from some developmental disorder ."
This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments .
Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
But here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
"Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior ."
"But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms , without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart ."
It seemed so intuitive to me .
"To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately , it would be necessary to look at the brain directly ."
"Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete , or even a misleading , picture of the child &apos;s problems ."
"Yet , despite all the advances in medical technology , the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited ."
"And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children ."
"Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG , or the electrical activity of the brain , in real time , allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions : vision , attention , language , audition ."
A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain .
"And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant , allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child &apos;s symptoms ."
"And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team , and we &apos;re finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders ."
And I &apos;m happy to say that I &apos;m now in the process of setting up this technology here in India .
"I &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by ABC News ."
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism .
"Like many autistic children , his mind was locked inside his body ."
There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time .
"And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially , and he would probably never have too much language ."
"When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin &apos;s brain , the results were startling ."
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic .
"He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye , but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism ."
"After Justin was given anti-seizure medication , the change in him was amazing ."
"Within a period of 60 days , his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words ."
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ .
"Research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures ."
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin .
"All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism , attention deficit disorder , mental retardation , language problems ."
"Instead , our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn &apos;t possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments ."
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment .
"For too long now , children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen ."
"And for too long , these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation ."
"But we are now in a new era of neuroscience , one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects , non-invasively , and find the true source of so many disabilities in children ."
"So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved ."
One more mind will be unlocked .
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there &apos;s still time for his or her brain to recover .
And all this by simply watching the child &apos;s brainwaves .
Thank you .

Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
"Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED ."
Why don &apos;t I just start by firing away with the video ?
"( Music ) ( Video ) Man : Okay , Glass , record a video ."
Woman : This is it . We &apos;re on in two minutes .
"Man 2 : Okay Glass , hang out with The Flying Club ."
Man 3 : Google &quot; &quot; photos of tiger heads . &quot; &quot; Hmm .
"Man 4 : You ready ? You ready ? ( Barking ) Woman 2 : Right there . Okay , Glass , take a picture ."
( Child shouting ) Man 5 : Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .

"( Applause ) Sergey Brin : Oh , sorry , I just got this message from a Nigerian prince ."
He needs help getting 10 million dollars .
"I like to pay attention to these because that &apos;s how we originally funded the company , and it &apos;s gone pretty well ."
"Though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , Project Glass ."
"Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information ."
Should it be by just walking around looking down ?
"But that was the vision behind Glass , and that &apos;s why we &apos;ve created this form factor ."
"Okay . And I don &apos;t want to go through all the things it does and whatnot , but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it ."
"In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you &apos;re out and about looking at your phone , it &apos;s kind of , is this what you &apos;re meant to do with your body ?"
You &apos;re standing around there and you &apos;re just rubbing this featureless piece of glass .
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
"So when we developed Glass , we thought really about , can we make something that frees your hands ?"
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there .
"They were all wearing Glass , and that &apos;s how we got that footage ."
And also you want something that frees your eyes .
"That &apos;s why we put the display up high , out of your line of sight , so it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re looking and it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re making eye contact with people ."
"And also we wanted to free up the ears , so the sound actually goes through , conducts straight to the bones in your cranium , which is a little bit freaky at first , but you get used to it ."
"And ironically , if you want to hear it better , you actually just cover your ear , which is kind of surprising , but that &apos;s how it works ."
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn &apos;t have to have a search query at all .
You &apos;d just have information come to you as you needed it .
"And this is now , 15 years later , sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you &apos;re out and about on the street talking to people and so forth ."
"This project has lasted now , been just over two years ."
We &apos;ve learned an amazing amount .
It &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
So our first prototypes we built were huge .
It was like cell phones strapped to your head .
"It was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable ."
"We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job , and then she almost ran away screaming ."
But we &apos;ve come a long way .
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
"Our original prototypes didn &apos;t have cameras at all , but it &apos;s been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family , my kids ."
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment .
"And lastly I &apos;ve realized , in experimenting with this device , that I also kind of have a nervous tic ."
"The cell phone is — yeah , you have to look down on it and all that , but it &apos;s also kind of a nervous habit ."
"Like if I smoked , I &apos;d probably just smoke instead ."
I would just light up a cigarette . It would look cooler .
"You know , I &apos;d be like — But in this case , you know , I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to ."
"But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it wasn &apos;t really — there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pressing ."
"And with this , I know I will get certain messages if I really need them , but I don &apos;t have to be checking them all the time ."
"Yeah , I &apos;ve really enjoyed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video ."
Thank you all very much .

"I &apos;m talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third-largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry ."
I &apos;m talking to you about modern-day slavery .
"I &apos;d like to tell you the story of these three children , Pranitha , Shaheen and Anjali ."
"Pranitha &apos;s mother was a woman in prostitution , a prostituted person ."
"She got infected with HIV , and towards the end of her life , when she was in the final stages of AIDS , she could not prostitute , so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker ."
"By the time we got the information , we reached there , Pranitha was already raped by three men ."
Shaheen &apos;s background I don &apos;t even know .
"We found her in a railway track , raped by many , many men , I don &apos;t know many ."
But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body .
And when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body .
"We still don &apos;t know who her parents are , who she is ."
All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally .
"Anjali &apos;s father , a drunkard , sold his child for pornography ."
"You &apos;re seeing here images of three years , four-year-olds , and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation ."
"In this country , and across the globe , hundreds and thousands of children , as young as three , as young as four , are sold into sexual slavery ."
But that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
They are sold in the name of adoption .
They are sold in the name of organ trade .
"They are sold in the name of forced labor , camel jockeying , anything , everything ."
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation .
And I tell you stories from there .
My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager .
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men .
I don &apos;t remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it .
"Yes , there were eight men who defiled me , raped me , but that didn &apos;t go into my consciousness ."
"I never felt like a victim , then or now ."
But what lingered from then till now — I am 40 today — is this huge outrageous anger .
"Two years , I was ostracized , I was stigmatized , I was isolated , because I was a victim ."
And that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
"We , as a society , we have PhDs in victimizing a victim ."
"Right from the age of 15 , when I started looking around me , I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices , but have absolutely no respite , because we don &apos;t allow them to come in ."
Where does their journey begin ?
"Most of them come from very optionless families , not just poor ."
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
"I had this I.S. officer &apos;s daughter , who is 14 years old , studying in ninth standard , who was raped chatting with one individual , and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine , who was trafficked ."
"I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families , and children from well-to-do families , who are getting trafficked ."
"These people are deceived , forced ."
99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution .
Some pay the price for it .
They &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
"They are voiceless , &#91; unclear &#93; , nameless people ."
"But the rest , who succumb into it , go through everyday torture ."
"Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends , or who want to have a family with you ."
"These are men who buy you for an hour , for a day , and use you , throw you ."
"Each of the girls that I have rescued — I have rescued more than 3,200 girls — each of them tell me one story in common ..."
"( Applause ) one story about one man , at least , putting chili powder in her vagina , one man taking a cigarette and burning her , one man whipping her ."
"We are living among those men : they &apos;re our brothers , fathers , uncles , cousins , all around us ."
And we are silent about them .
We think it is easy money .
We think it is shortcut .
We think the person likes to do what she &apos;s doing .
"But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections , sexually transmitted infections , HIV , AIDS , syphilis , gonorrhea , you name it , substance abuse , drugs , everything under the sun ."
"And one day she gives up on you and me , because we have no options for her ."
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation .
"She believes , &quot; &quot; Yes , this is it , this is what my destiny is about . &quot; &quot; And this is normal , to get raped by 100 men a day ."
And it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
It &apos;s abnormal to get rehabilitated .
It &apos;s in that context that I work .
It &apos;s in that context that I rescue children .
"I &apos;ve rescued children as young as three years , and I &apos;ve rescued women as old as 40 years ."
"When I rescued them , one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin ."
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected .
One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive .
And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain .
"And for me , I was my greatest experience ."
"Understanding my own self , understanding my own pain , my own isolation , was my greatest teacher ."
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential .
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder .
"She works for a very big company , a workshop in Hyderabad , making furnitures ."
"She earns around 12,000 rupees ."
"She is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder ."
Why welding and why not computers ?
"We felt , one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage ."
"They did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they &apos;ve crossed the barrier of it ."
"And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world , very easily , and not feel very shy about it ."
"We have trained girls as carpenters , as masons , as security guards , as cab drivers ."
"And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field , gaining confidence , restoring dignity , and building hopes in their own lives ."
"These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction , as masons , full-time masons ."
What has been my challenge ?
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
I &apos;ve been beaten up more than 14 times in my life .
I can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
I &apos;ve lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue .
My biggest challenge is society .
It &apos;s you and me .
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own .
"A very supportive friend of mine , a well-wisher of mine , used to give me every month , 2,000 rupees for vegetables ."
"When her mother fell sick she said , &quot; &quot; Sunitha , you have so much of contacts ."
"Can you get somebody in my house to work , so that she can look after my mother ? &quot; &quot; And there is a long pause ."
"And then she says , &quot; &quot; Not one of our girls . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very fashionable to talk about human trafficking , in this fantastic A-C hall ."
"It &apos;s very nice for discussion , discourse , making films and everything ."
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .
"It &apos;s not nice to give them employment in our factories , our companies ."
It &apos;s not nice for our children to study with their children .
There it ends .
That &apos;s my biggest challenge .
"If I &apos;m here today , I &apos;m here not only as Sunitha Krishnan ."
I &apos;m here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking .
They need your compassion .
They need your empathy .
"They need , much more than anything else , your acceptance ."
"Many times when I talk to people , I keep telling them one thing : don &apos;t tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem ."
Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ?
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m here for , asking for your support , demanding for your support , requesting for your support ."
Can you break your culture of silence ?
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story ?
Tell them this story . Convince them to tell the story to another two persons .
"I &apos;m not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings , or Medha Patkars , or something like that ."
"I &apos;m asking you , in your limited world , can you open your minds ? Can you open your hearts ?"
Can you just encompass these people too ?
Because they are also a part of us .
They are also part of this world .
"I &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more ."
They died of AIDS last year .
"I &apos;m asking you to help them , accept as human beings — not as philanthropy , not as charity , but as human beings who deserve all our support ."
"I &apos;m asking you this because no child , no human being , deserves what these children have gone through ."
Thank you .

"Four years ago , a security researcher , or , as most people would call it , a hacker , found a way to literally make ATMs throw money at him ."
"His name was Barnaby Jack , and this technique was later called &quot; &quot; jackpotting &quot; &quot; in his honor ."
I &apos;m here today because I think we actually need hackers .
"Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge , but he chose to show the world his research instead ."
He believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution .
And I feel the same way .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here today .
We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have .
They scare us .
But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all .
"So I am here today because I think we need hackers , and in fact , they just might be the immune system for the information age ."
"Sometimes they make us sick , but they also find those hidden threats in our world , and they make us fix it ."
"I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk , so let me save you the effort ."
"In true TED fashion , here is my most embarrassing picture ."
"But it would be difficult for you to find me in it , because I &apos;m the one who looks like a boy standing to the side ."
I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn &apos;t let me join .
"This is who I was , but this is who I wanted to be : Angelina Jolie ."
"She portrayed Acid Burn in the &apos; 95 film &quot; &quot; Hackers . &quot; &quot; She was pretty and she could rollerblade , but being a hacker , that made her powerful ."
"And I wanted to be just like her , so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums ."
I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code .
"I didn &apos;t really know what it did , but I copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that ."
Open Sesame .
"But with great power comes great responsibility , and you all like to think that if we had such powers , we would only use them for good ."
"But what if you could read your ex &apos;s emails , or add a couple zeros to your bank account ."
What would you do then ?
"Indeed , many hackers do not resist those temptations , and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud , malware or plain old identity theft , which is a serious issue ."
"But there are other hackers , hackers who just like to break things , and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it ."
This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office .
"He reported it to the company , of course , but they ignored his report ."
"Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature , not a bug , until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people &apos;s files ."
But they didn &apos;t steal anything .
They left a note : Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world .
Here &apos;s what you should do to fix it .
We hope we helped .
"By getting into people &apos;s files like that , yeah , they broke the law , but they also forced that company to fix their product ."
"Making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community , and it is controversial , but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day ."
This is what Khalil did .
"Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank , and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook which he attempted to report through the company &apos;s bug bounty program ."
These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code .
"Unfortunately , due to some miscommunications , his report was not acknowledged ."
"Frustrated with the exchange , he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg &apos;s wall ."
"This got their attention , all right , and they fixed the bug , but because he hadn &apos;t reported it properly , he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries ."
"Thankfully for Khalil , a group of hackers were watching out for him ."
"In fact , they raised more than 13,000 dollars to reward him for this discovery , raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing ."
But I think there &apos;s a greater story here still .
"Even companies founded by hackers , like Facebook was , still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers ."
"And so for more conservative organizations , it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it ."
"But I think it &apos;s worth the effort , because the alternative , to blindly fight all hackers , is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge ."
These are things that will come back and bite you .
"It is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web , especially in times like this , like today even , as governments and corporates fight to control the Internet ."
"I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition , its last line of defense even , perhaps someone like Anonymous , the leading brand of global hacktivism ."
"This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today , but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns ."
"It turns out , the Internet doesn &apos;t like it when you try to remove things from it , and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world , from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide , Australia ."
"This proved that Anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets , and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world ."
"Since then , they &apos;ve gone after many targets ."
"They &apos;ve uncovered corruption , abuse ."
"They &apos;ve hacked popes and politicians , and I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents ."
"I think that , like Robin Hood , they are in the business of redistribution , but what they are after isn &apos;t your money ."
It &apos;s not your documents . It &apos;s your attention .
"They grab the spotlight for causes they support , forcing us to take note , acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be ."
"They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists , and I cannot justify their illegal means , but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all ."
"The reality is , hackers can do a lot more than break things ."
They can bring people together .
"And if the Internet doesn &apos;t like it when you try to remove things from it , just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down ."
"This took place in Egypt in January 2011 , and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo , he sent his personal troops down to Egypt &apos;s Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country &apos;s connection to the world overnight ."
"For a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented , and for hackers , it made it personal ."
"Hackers like the Telecomix group were already active on the ground , helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio ."
"It was high season for low tech , which the government couldn &apos;t block , but when the Net went completely down , Telecomix brought in the big guns ."
They found European service providers that still had 20-year-old analog dial-up access infrastructure .
"They opened up 300 of those lines for Egyptians to use , serving slow but sweet Internet connection for Egyptians ."
This worked .
"It worked so well , in fact , one guy even used it to download an episode of &quot; &quot; How I Met Your Mother . &quot; &quot; But while Egypt &apos;s future is still uncertain , when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later , Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines , and Anonymous , they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website ."
"But with this sort of power , it really depends on where you stand , because one man &apos;s hero can be another &apos;s villain , and so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro-Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime ."
"They &apos;ve taken down multiple high-profile targets in the past few years , including the Associated Press &apos;s Twitter account , in which they posted a message about an attack on the White House injuring President Obama ."
"This tweet was fake , of course , but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not , and a lot of people lost a lot of money ."
This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now .
"In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America , from Europe to the United States , hackers are a force for social , political and military influence ."
"As individuals or in groups , volunteers or military conflicts , there are hackers everywhere ."
"They come from all walks of life , ethnicities , ideologies and genders , I might add ."
They are now shaping the world &apos;s stage .
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century .
"This is because access to information is a critical currency of power , one which governments would like to control , a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs , a thing they need hackers for , by the way ."
"And so the establishment has long had a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers , because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large ."
"Two years ago , I saw General Keith Alexander ."
"He &apos;s the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander , but instead of his four star general uniform , he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt ."
"This was at DEF CON , the world &apos;s largest hacker conference ."
"Perhaps like me , General Alexander didn &apos;t see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas ."
I think he saw untapped potential .
"In fact , he was there to give a hiring pitch ."
"&quot; &quot; In this room right here , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; is the talent our nation needs . &quot;"
"Well , hackers in the back row replied , &quot; Then stop arresting us . &quot;"
"( Applause ) Indeed , for years , hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence , but in light of what we know now , who is more watchful of our online world ?"
"The rules of the game are not that clear anymore , but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates on their own playing field ."
"To me , that represents hope ."
"For the past three decades , hackers have done a lot of things , but they have also impacted civil liberties , innovation and Internet freedom , so I think it &apos;s time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them , because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys , how can they be the heroes too ?"
My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers : They just can &apos;t see something broken in the world and leave it be .
"They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it , and so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world ."
"They make us , they force us to fix things or demand something better , and I think we need them to do just that , because after all , it is not information that wants to be free , it &apos;s us ."
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Hack the planet !

"And if we look where the income ends up , this is 100 percent the world &apos;s annual income ."

This is Mao Tse-tung . He brought health to China .

"They came from here , a mineral country ."
"If I split Uganda , there &apos;s quite a difference within Uganda ."
Everything in this world exists in Africa .

So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years .
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways .

"The first half of the 20th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs , a cataclysm ."
"We had the First World War , the Great Depression , the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations ."
"And each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world ."
"And they threw up walls — political walls , trade walls , transportation walls , communication walls , iron curtains — which divided peoples and nations ."
It was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss .
Trade walls began to come tumbling down .
"Here are some data on tariffs : starting at 40 percent , coming down to less than 5 percent ."
We globalized the world . And what does that mean ?
It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries ; we made the world more cooperative .
Transportation walls came tumbling down .
"You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods ."
"Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons ; it can be manned with a smaller crew ; and unloaded faster than ever before ."
"Communication walls , I don &apos;t have to tell you — the Internet — have come tumbling down ."
"And of course the iron curtains , political walls have come tumbling down ."
Now all of this has been tremendous for the world .
Trade has increased .
Here is just a little bit of data .
"In 1990 , exports from China to the United States : 15 billion dollars ."
By 2007 : over 300 billion dollars .
"And perhaps most remarkably , at the beginning of the 21st century , really for the first time in modern history , growth extended to almost all parts of the world ."
"So China , I &apos;ve already mentioned , beginning around 1978 , around the time of the death of Mao , growth — ten percent a year ."
"Year after year after year , absolutely incredible ."
Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China .
China is the world &apos;s greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades .
"India , starting a little bit later , but in 1990 , begetting tremendous growth ."
"Incomes at that time less than $ 1,000 per year ."
And over the next 18 years have almost tripled .
Growth of six percent a year . Absolutely incredible .
"Now Africa , Sub-Saharan Africa — Sub-Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth ."
And we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here .
Growth was negative .
"People were actually getting poorer than their parents , and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been ."
"But at the end of the 20th century , the beginning of the 21st century , we saw growth in Africa ."
"And I think , as you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s reasons for optimism , because I believe that the best is yet to come ."
Now why .
On the cutting edge today it &apos;s new ideas which are driving growth .
"And by that I mean it &apos;s products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low ."
More than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge .
Now ideas have this amazing property .
"Thomas Jefferson , I think , really expressed this quite well ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself , without lessening mine ."
"As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me . &quot; &quot; Or to put it slightly differently : one apple feeds one man , but an idea can feed the world ."
Now this is not new . This is practically not new to TEDsters .
This is practically the model of TED .
But what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before .
"This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important , more powerful than ever before , and are going to increase growth more than ever before ."
"And to explain why this is so , I have a question ."
"Suppose that there are two diseases : one of them is rare , the other one is common , but if they are not treated they are equally severe ."
"If you had to choose , which would you rather have : the common disease or the rare disease ?"
"Common , the common — I think that &apos;s absolutely right , and why ? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases ."
The reason for this is incentives .
"It costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats 1,000 people , 100,000 people , or a million people ."
But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people .
So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people .
To put this differently : larger markets save lives .
In this case misery truly does love company .
"Now think about the following : if China and India were as rich as the United States is today , the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now ."
"Now we are not there yet , but it is happening ."
As other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously .
"And that means an increase incentive to do research and development , which benefits everyone in the world ."
"Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas , whether it &apos;s software , whether it &apos;s a computer chip , whether it &apos;s a new design ."
"For the Hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies : it &apos;s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger ."
"People are willing to invest more , and the budgets are larger ."
"Alright . Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas , how do we maximize that incentive ?"
"It &apos;s by having one world market , by globalizing the world ."
"The way I like to put this is : one idea . Ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market ."
"One idea , one world , one market ."
Well how else can we create new ideas ?
That &apos;s one reason .
Globalize trade .
How else can we create new ideas ?
"Well , more idea creators ."
"Now idea creators , they come from all walks of life ."
Artists and innovators — many of the people you &apos;ve seen on this stage .
"I &apos;m going to focus on scientists and engineers because I have some data on that , and I &apos;m a data person ."
"Now , today , less than one-tenth of one percent of the world &apos;s population are scientists and engineers ."
( Laughter ) The United States has been an idea leader .
A large fraction of those people are in the United States .
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership .
And for that I am very grateful .
That is a good thing .
"It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States , and a handful of other developed countries , have shouldered the entire burden of research and development ."
"But consider the following : if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone , which are shared by everyone ."
"I think of the great Indian mathematician , Ramanujan ."
"How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields , barely able to feed themselves , when they could be feeding the world ?"
Now we &apos;re not there yet .
But it is going to happen in this century .
"The real tragedy of the last century is this : if you think about the world &apos;s population as a giant computer , a massively parallel processor , then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line ."
But in this century China is coming on line .
India is coming on line .
Africa is coming on line .
We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century .
Here is just some data . This is China .
1996 : less than one million new university students in China per year ; 2006 : over five million .
Now think what this means .
This means we all benefit when another country gets rich .
We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy .
"That is something that we should embrace — a wealthy China , a wealthy India , a wealthy Africa ."
We need a greater demand for ideas — those larger markets I was talking about earlier — and a greater supply of ideas for the world .
Now you can see some of the reasons why I &apos;m optimistic .
"Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas , the incentive to create new ideas ."
Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas .
In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism .
"From about the beginnings of humanity to 1500 : zero economic growth , nothing ."
"1500 to 1800 : maybe a little bit of economic growth , but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today ."
1900s : maybe one percent .
Twentieth century : a little bit over two percent .
"Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3 , even higher percent ."
"Even at that rate , by 2100 average GDP per capita in the world will be $ 200,000 ."
"That &apos;s not U.S. GDP per capita , which will be over a million , but world GDP per capita — $ 200,000 ."
That &apos;s not that far .
We won &apos;t make it .
But some of our grandchildren probably will .
"And I should say , I think this is a rather modest prediction ."
In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy .
In Kurzweilian terms I &apos;m like the Eeyore of economic growth .
( Laughter ) Alright what about problems ?
What about a great depression ?
Well let &apos;s take a look . Let &apos;s take a look at the Great Depression .
Here is GDP per capita from 1900 to 1929 .
"Now let &apos;s imagine that you were an economist in 1929 , trying to forecast future growth for the United States , not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff , not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century ."
"What would you have predicted , not knowing this ?"
"If you had based your prediction , your forecast on 1900 to 1929 you &apos;d have predicted something like this ."
"If you &apos;d been a little more optimistic — say , based upon the Roaring Twenties — you &apos;d have said this ."
So what actually happened ?
We went off a cliff but we recovered .
In fact in the second half of the 20th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the 20th century .
So growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression .
Alright . What else ?
Oil . Oil . This was a big topic .
When I was writing up my notes oil was $ 140 per barrel .
"So people were asking a question . They were saying , &quot; Is China drinking our milkshake ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And there is some truth to this , in the sense that we have something of a finite resource , and increased growth is going to push up demand for that ."
But I think I don &apos;t have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing .
"Moreover , as everyone knows , look — it &apos;s energy , not oil , which counts ."
And higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R &amp; D.
You can see this in the data .
"As oil prices go up , energy patents go up ."
"The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today , than ever in the past , because of what I &apos;m talking about ."
"One idea , one world , one market ."
"So I &apos;m optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas : to keep globalizing world markets , keep extending cooperation across national boundaries , and keep investing in education ."
"Now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this : to keep our education system globalized , to keep our education system open to students from all over the world , because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles ."
Now remember here what Jefferson said .
"Jefferson said , &quot; &quot; When they come and light their candles at ours , they gain light , and we are not darkened . &quot; &quot; But Jefferson wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?"
"Because the truth is , when they light their candles at ours , there is twice as much light available for everyone ."
So my view is : Be optimistic .
Spread the ideas . Spread the light .
Thank you .

( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
"Imagining a solo cello concert , one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites ."
"As a child studying these eternal masterpieces , Bach &apos;s music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up ."
"Late at night , after hours of practicing , I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents &apos; stereo ."
It all became music to me .
I didn &apos;t hear the boundaries .
I still start every day practicing playing Bach .
His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
"But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression , I realized that with today &apos;s technological resources , there &apos;s no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument ."
"The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing , perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience ."
The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept .
"The excitement from using multi-tracking , the way I did in the piece you will hear next , comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers , all generated from a single source ."
My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas .
"When composers write music for me , I ask them to forget what they know about the cello ."
I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before .
I want to create endless possibilities with this cello .
"I become the medium through which the music is being channeled , and in the process , when all is right , the music is transformed and so am I."

"I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation , sharing some of the problems ."
"And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that — being honest about what was going well , what wasn &apos;t , and making it kind of an annual thing ."
"A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems , because I think there are some very important problems that don &apos;t get worked on naturally ."
"That is , the market does not drive the scientists , the communicators , the thinkers , the governments to do the right things ."
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to .
So this morning I &apos;m going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand .
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist .
"Any tough problem , I think it can be solved ."
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past .
"Over the past century , average lifespan has more than doubled ."
"Another statistic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood deaths ."
"As recently as 1960 , 110 million children were born , and 20 million of those died before the age of five ."
"Five years ago , 135 million children were born — so , more — and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five ."
So that &apos;s a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate .
It &apos;s a phenomenal thing .
Each one of those lives matters a lot .
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs : vaccines that were used more widely .
"For example , measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 ."
So we really can make changes .
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .
And I think that &apos;s doable in well under 20 years .
"Why ? Well there &apos;s only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths : diarrhea , pneumonia and malaria ."
"So that brings us to the first problem that I &apos;ll raise this morning , which is how do we stop a deadly disease that &apos;s spread by mosquitos ?"
"Well , what &apos;s the history of this disease ?"
It &apos;s been a severe disease for thousands of years .
"In fact , if we look at the genetic code , it &apos;s the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths ."
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s .
So it was absolutely gigantic .
And the disease was all over the world .
A terrible disease . It was in the United States . It was in Europe .
"People didn &apos;t know what caused it until the early 1900s , when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos ."
So it was everywhere .
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT .
"The other was treating the patients with quinine , or quinine derivatives ."
And so that &apos;s why the death rate did come down .
"Now , ironically , what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones , which is where the rich countries are ."
"So we can see : 1900 , it &apos;s everywhere ."
"1945 , it &apos;s still most places ."
"1970 , the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it ."
"1990 , you &apos;ve gotten most of the northern areas ."
And more recently you can see it &apos;s just around the equator .
"And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries , it doesn &apos;t get much investment ."
"For example , there &apos;s more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria ."
"Now , baldness , it &apos;s a terrible thing ."
( Laughter ) And rich men are afflicted .
And so that &apos;s why that priority has been set .
"But , malaria — even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact ."
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it .
It means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
"Now , malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos ."
"I brought some here , just so you could experience this ."
We &apos;ll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s no reason only poor people should have the experience .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Those mosquitos are not infected .
So we &apos;ve come up with a few new things . We &apos;ve got bed nets .
And bed nets are a great tool .
"What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night , so the mosquitos that bite late at night can &apos;t get at them ."
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
And that &apos;s happened now in a number of countries .
It &apos;s great to see .
But we have to be careful because malaria — the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .
So every tool that we &apos;ve ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective .
And so you end up with two choices .
"If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vigorously , you can actually get a local eradication ."
And that &apos;s where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
"Or , if you go in kind of half-heartedly , for a period of time you &apos;ll reduce the disease burden , but eventually those tools will become ineffective , and the death rate will soar back up again ."
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn &apos;t pay attention .
Now we &apos;re on the upswing .
Bed net funding is up .
There &apos;s new drug discovery going on .
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that &apos;s going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months .
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it &apos;s effective .
So we &apos;re going to have these new tools .
But that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .
"It involves communicators to keep the funding high , to keep the visibility high , to tell the success stories ."
"It involves social scientists , so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets , but 90 percent ."
"We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this , to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together ."
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things .
"And so as these elements come together , I &apos;m quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria ."
"Now let me turn to a second question , a fairly different question , but I &apos;d say equally important ."
And this is : How do you make a teacher great ?
"It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on , and we &apos;d understand very well ."
"And the answer is , really , that we don &apos;t ."
Let &apos;s start with why this is important .
"Well , all of us here , I &apos;ll bet , had some great teachers ."
We all had a wonderful education .
"That &apos;s part of the reason we &apos;re here today , part of the reason we &apos;re successful ."
"I can say that , even though I &apos;m a college drop-out ."
I had great teachers .
"In fact , in the United States , the teaching system has worked fairly well ."
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education .
"And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world , if you measure them against the other top 20 percent ."
And they &apos;ve gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront .
"Now , the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis , but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting ."
Not only has that been weak. it &apos;s getting weaker .
"And if you look at the economy , it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education ."
And we have to change this .
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
"We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education , like science and mathematics ."
"When I first learned the statistics , I was pretty stunned at how bad things are ."
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school .
And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year .
Because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that .
They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent .
"For minority kids , it &apos;s over 50 percent ."
"And even if you graduate from high school , if you &apos;re low-income , you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree ."
"If you &apos;re low-income in the United States , you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree ."
And that doesn &apos;t seem entirely fair .
"So , how do you make education better ?"
"Now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this ."
There &apos;s many people working on it .
"We &apos;ve worked on small schools , we &apos;ve funded scholarships , we &apos;ve done things in libraries ."
A lot of these things had a good effect .
"But the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing ."
"And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers , between , say , the top quartile — the very best — and the bottom quartile ."
How much variation is there within a school or between schools ?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class — based on test scores — by over 10 percent in a single year .
What does that mean ?
"That means that if the entire U.S. , for two years , had top quartile teachers , the entire difference between us and Asia would go away ."
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away .
"So , it &apos;s simple . All you need are those top quartile teachers ."
"And so you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Wow , we should reward those people ."
We should retain those people .
We should find out what they &apos;re doing and transfer that skill to other people . &quot; &quot; But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
What are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
What do they look like ?
You might think these must be very senior teachers .
And the answer is no .
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter .
"The variation is very , very small ."
You might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
They &apos;ve gone back and they &apos;ve gotten their Master &apos;s of Education .
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality .
"That bottom thing , which says there &apos;s no effect at all , is a master &apos;s degree ."
"Now , the way the pay system works is there &apos;s two things that are rewarded ."
One is seniority .
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master &apos;s degree .
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
Teach for America : slight effect .
For math teachers majoring in math there &apos;s a measurable effect .
"But , overwhelmingly , it &apos;s your past performance ."
There are some people who are very good at this .
"And we &apos;ve done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it , to raise the average capability — or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system ."
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher &apos;s leave ? &quot; &quot; The answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system ."
And it &apos;s a system with very high turnover .
"Now , there are a few places — very few — where great teachers are being made ."
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP .
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power .
It &apos;s an unbelievable thing .
"They have 66 schools — mostly middle schools , some high schools — and what goes on is great teaching ."
"They take the poorest kids , and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges ."
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .
They &apos;re team teaching . They &apos;re constantly improving their teachers .
"They &apos;re taking data , the test scores , and saying to a teacher , &quot; &quot; Hey , you caused this amount of increase . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re deeply engaged in making teaching better ."
"When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it &apos;s very bizarre ."
"I sat down and I thought , &quot; &quot; What is going on ? &quot; &quot; The teacher was running around , and the energy level was high ."
"I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the sports rally or something ."
"What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren &apos;t paying attention , which kids were bored , and calling kids rapidly , putting things up on the board ."
"It was a very dynamic environment , because particularly in those middle school years — fifth through eighth grade — keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention , nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn &apos;t want to be there ."
Everybody needs to be involved .
And so KIPP is doing it .
How does that compare to a normal school ?
"Well , in a normal school , teachers aren &apos;t told how good they are ."
The data isn &apos;t gathered .
"In the teacher &apos;s contract , it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom — sometimes to once per year ."
And they need advanced notice to do that .
"So imagine running a factory where you &apos;ve got these workers , some of them just making crap and the management is told , &quot; &quot; Hey , you can only come down here once a year , but you need to let us know , because we might actually fool you , and try and do a good job in that one brief moment . &quot; &quot; Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn &apos;t have the tools to do it ."
"They don &apos;t have the test scores , and there &apos;s a whole thing of trying to block the data ."
"For example , New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers ."
And so that &apos;s sort of working in the opposite direction .
"But I &apos;m optimistic about this , I think there are some clear things we can do ."
"First of all , there &apos;s a lot more testing going on , and that &apos;s given us the picture of where we are ."
"And that allows us to understand who &apos;s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are ."
"Of course , digital video is cheap now ."
Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools .
"And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say , &quot; &quot; OK , here &apos;s a little clip of something I thought I did well ."
Here &apos;s a little clip of something I think I did poorly .
"Advise me — when this kid acted up , how should I have dealt with that ? &quot; &quot; And they could all sit and work together on those problems ."
"You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it , have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff ."
"You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course , learn from that ."
"If you have a kid who &apos;s behind , you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept ."
"And in fact , these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet , but you could make it so that DVDs were always available , and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers ."
"And so by thinking of this as a personnel system , we can do it much better ."
"Now there &apos;s a book actually , about KIPP — the place that this is going on — that Jay Matthews , a news reporter , wrote — called , &quot; &quot; Work Hard , Be Nice . &quot; &quot; And I thought it was so fantastic ."
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
I &apos;m going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .
"( Applause ) Now , we put a lot of money into education , and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have ."
"In fact we have in the stimulus bill — it &apos;s interesting — the House version actually had money in it for these data systems , and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things ."
But I — I &apos;m optimistic .
"I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is , and it really can make a difference for millions of lives , if we get it right ."
I only had time to frame those two problems .
"There &apos;s a lot more problems like that — AIDS , pneumonia — I can just see you &apos;re getting excited , just at the very name of these things ."
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad .
"You know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen ."
Governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
The private sector doesn &apos;t naturally put its resources into these things .
"So it &apos;s going to take brilliant people like you to study these things , get other people involved — and you &apos;re helping to come up with solutions ."
"And with that , I think there &apos;s some great things that will come out of it ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor , living on less than one dollar a day ."
"I went to a very elitist , snobbish , expensive education in India , and that almost destroyed me ."
"I was all set to be a diplomat , teacher , doctor — all laid out ."
"Then , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was laid out for me .
Everything was at my feet .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of curiosity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 1965 , I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India , and I saw starvation , death , people dying of hunger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
Mother went into a coma .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is laid out for you , the best jobs are laid out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best eduction ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"No job , no money , no security , no prospect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and dig wells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dig wells for five years ?"
"You went to the most expensive school and college in India , and you want to dig wells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have , which are never brought into the mainstream — which is never identified , respected , applied on a large scale ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a Barefoot College — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"Elders came to me and said , &quot; &quot; Are you running from the police ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You failed in your exam ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"Is there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college . &quot; &quot; So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; Please , don &apos;t bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master &apos;s , you are disqualified to come ."
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a dignity of labor .
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community .
"So we started the Barefoot College , and we redefined professionalism ."
Who is a professional ?
"A professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief ."
A water diviner is a professional .
A traditional midwife is a professional .
A traditional bone setter is a professional .
These are professionals all over the world .
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal .
"It needs to be used , needs to be applied , needs to be shown to the world outside — that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today ."
So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi .
"You eat on the floor , you sleep on the floor , you work on the floor ."
"There are no contracts , no written contracts ."
"You can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to Barefoot College ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the Barefoot College ."
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
"Whatever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .
"Battered , bruised , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a certificate .
You are certified by the community you serve .
You don &apos;t need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986 .
"It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1.50 a sq. ft ."
"150 people lived there , worked there ."
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002 .
"But then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , they made the blueprints , but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia ."
"I asked a forester — high-powered , paper-qualified expert — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the soil and said , &quot; &quot; Forget it . No way ."
Not even worth it .
"No water , rocky soil . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a spot ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this spot ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked quietly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"Went to the roof , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; Clear out ."
The men should clear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is waterproofing the roof . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of jaggery , a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t leak .
"Since 1986 , it hasn &apos;t leaked ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully solar-electrified .
All the power comes from the sun .
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof .
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
"So long as the sun shines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest , a Hindu priest , who &apos;s only done eight years of primary schooling — never been to school , never been to college ."
He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed .
"Food , if you come to the Barefoot College , is solar cooked ."
"But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women , illiterate women , who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker ."
It &apos;s a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker .
"Unfortunately , they &apos;re almost half German , they &apos;re so precise ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find Indian women so precise .
"Absolutely to the last inch , they can make that cooker ."
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking .
"We have a dentist — she &apos;s a grandmother , illiterate , who &apos;s a dentist ."
"She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children ."
"Barefoot technology : this was 1986 — no engineer , no architect thought of it — but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs ."
Very little water is wasted .
"All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank , and no water is wasted ."
"If we have four years of drought , we still have water on the campus , because we collect rainwater ."
"60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after animals — sheep , goats — domestic chores ."
So we thought of starting a school at night for the children .
"Because the night schools of Tilonia , over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools ."
Because it &apos;s for the convenience of the child ; it &apos;s not for the convenience of the teacher .
And what do we teach in these schools ?
"Democracy , citizenship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if your animal is sick ."
This is what we teach in the night schools .
But all the schools are solar-lit .
Every five years we have an election .
"Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process , and they elect a prime minister ."
The prime minister is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 goats in the morning , but she &apos;s prime minister in the evening ."
"She has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health ."
"And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Children &apos;s Prize five years ago , and she went to Sweden ."
First time ever going out of her village .
Never seen Sweden .
Wasn &apos;t dazzled at all by what was happening .
"And the Queen of Sweden , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not dazzled by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said , &quot; &quot; Please tell her I &apos;m the prime minister . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high , we use puppetry ."
Puppets is the way we communicate .
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old .
He is my psychoanalyst . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doctor . He &apos;s my lawyer .
He &apos;s my donor .
"He actually raises money , solves my disputes ."
He solves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s tension in the village , if attendance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a friction between the teacher and the parent , the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; Shake hands ."
The attendance must not drop . &quot; &quot; These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this decentralized , demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages , we &apos;ve covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan — all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained ."
"And we went to Ladakh , and we asked this woman — this , at minus 40 , you have to come out of the roof , because there &apos;s no place , it was all snowed up on both sides — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the benefit you had from solar electricity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a minute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my husband &apos;s face in winter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Went to Afghanistan .
One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable .
"( Laughter ) Men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate . ( Laughter )"
"All across the globe , you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate ."
"Why ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great solution : train grandmothers .
What &apos;s the best way of communicating in the world today ?
Television ? No .
Telegraph ? No .
Telephone ? No .
Tell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to Afghanistan for the first time , and we picked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Impossible . They don &apos;t even go out of their rooms , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a concession . I &apos;ll take the husbands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the husbands along ."
"Of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we train these women ?"
Sign language .
You don &apos;t choose the written word .
You don &apos;t choose the spoken word .
You use sign language .
And in six months they can become solar engineers .
They go back and solar-electrify their own village .
"This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village , set up a workshop — the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This woman"
is an extraordinary grandmother .
"55 years old , and she &apos;s solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan ."
And they haven &apos;t collapsed .
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC .
He didn &apos;t know .
Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan .
"We went to Africa , and we did the same thing ."
"All these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speaking a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
"I went to Sierra Leone , and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night — comes across this village ."
"Comes back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grandmothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; The minister couldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Where did they go ? &quot; &quot; Went to India and back . &quot;
Went straight to the president .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he summoned me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you train me 150 grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , Mr. President ."
But they will . The grandmothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone .
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone .
Gambia : we went to select a grandmother in Gambia .
Went to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The community got together and said , &quot; &quot; Take these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; Difficult husband ; not possible . &quot;"
"Called the husband , the husband came , swaggering , politician , mobile in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she runs off with an Indian man ? &quot;"
That was his biggest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll ring you up on the mobile . &quot; &quot; She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger ."
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran .
"She handled the national press , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Where &apos;s your husband ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , somewhere . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Success story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just wind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solutions outside .
Look for solutions within .
And listen to people . They have the solutions in front of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
Don &apos;t even worry .
"Don &apos;t listen to the World Bank , listen to the people on the ground ."
They have all the solutions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi .
"&quot; &quot; First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , and then you win . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
"I haven &apos;t told many people this , but in my head , I &apos;ve got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time ."
I am also autistic .
"People tend to diagnose autism with really specific check-box descriptions , but in reality , it &apos;s a whole variation as to what we &apos;re like ."
"For instance , my little brother , he &apos;s very severely autistic ."
He &apos;s nonverbal . He can &apos;t talk at all .
But I love to talk .
"People often associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else , but I know so many autistic people who love being creative ."
"But that is a stereotype , and the stereotypes of things are often , if not always , wrong ."
"For instance , a lot of people think autism and think &quot; &quot; Rain Man &quot; &quot; immediately ."
"That &apos;s the common belief , that every single autistic person is Dustin Hoffman , and that &apos;s not true ."
"But that &apos;s not just with autistic people , either ."
"I &apos;ve seen it with LGBTQ people , with women , with POC people ."
People are so afraid of variety that they try to fit everything into a tiny little box with really specific labels .
This is something that actually happened to me in real life : I googled &quot; &quot; autistic people are ... &quot; &quot; and it comes up with suggestions as to what you &apos;re going to type . I googled &quot; &quot; autistic people are ... &quot; &quot;
and the top result was &quot; &quot; demons . &quot; &quot; That is the first thing that people think when they think autism .
They know .
"( Laughter ) One of the things I can do because I &apos;m autistic — it &apos;s an ability rather than a disability — is I &apos;ve got a very , very vivid imagination ."
Let me explain it to you a bit .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m walking in two worlds most of the time .
"There &apos;s the real world , the world that we all share , and there &apos;s the world in my mind , and the world in my mind is often so much more real than the real world ."
"Like , it &apos;s very easy for me to let my mind loose because I don &apos;t try and fit myself into a tiny little box ."
That &apos;s one of the best things about being autistic .
You don &apos;t have the urge to do that .
"You find what you want to do , you find a way to do it , and you get on with it ."
"If I was trying to fit myself into a box , I wouldn &apos;t be here , I wouldn &apos;t have achieved half the things that I have now ."
"There are problems , though ."
"There are problems with being autistic , and there are problems with having too much imagination ."
"School can be a problem in general , but having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull and you are secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in which you are not in that lesson , that adds to your list of problems ."
"( Laughter ) Also , when my imagination takes hold , my body takes on a life of its own ."
"When something very exciting happens in my inner world , I &apos;ve just got to run ."
"I &apos;ve got to rock backwards and forwards , or sometimes scream ."
"This gives me so much energy , and I &apos;ve got to have an outlet for all that energy ."
"But I &apos;ve done that ever since I was a child , ever since I was a tiny little girl ."
"And my parents thought it was cute , so they didn &apos;t bring it up , but when I got into school , they didn &apos;t really agree that it was cute ."
It can be that people don &apos;t want to be friends with the girl that starts screaming in an algebra lesson .
"But that &apos;s fine with me , because it sorts the wheat from the chaff , and I can find which people are genuine and true and I can pick these people as my friends ."
"But if you think about it , what is normal ?"
What does it mean ?
Imagine if that was the best compliment you ever received .
"&quot; Wow , you are really normal . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) But compliments are , &quot; you are extraordinary &quot; or &quot; &quot; you step outside the box . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s &quot; &quot; you &apos;re amazing . &quot; &quot; So if people want to be these things , why are so many people striving to be normal ?"
Why are people pouring their brilliant individual light into a mold ?
"People are so afraid of variety that they try and force everyone , even people who don &apos;t want to or can &apos;t , to become normal ."
"There are camps for LGBTQ people or autistic people to try and make them this &quot; &quot; normal , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s terrifying that people would do that in this day and age ."
"All in all , I wouldn &apos;t trade my autism and my imagination for the world ."
"Because I am autistic , I &apos;ve presented documentaries to the BBC , I &apos;m in the midst of writing a book , I &apos;m doing this — this is fantastic — and one of the best things that I &apos;ve achieved , that I consider to have achieved , is I &apos;ve found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister , who as I &apos;ve said are nonverbal . They can &apos;t speak ."
"And people would often write off someone who &apos;s nonverbal , but that &apos;s silly , because my little brother and sister are the best siblings that you could ever hope for ."
"They &apos;re just the best , and I love them so much and I care about them more than anything else ."
"I &apos;m going to leave you with one question : If we can &apos;t get inside the person &apos;s minds , no matter if they &apos;re autistic or not , instead of punishing anything that strays from normal , why not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination ?"
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So a few years ago , I did something really brave , or some would say really stupid ."
"For years , I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser , as an organizer , but in my heart , I always wanted to run ."
The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992 .
"She had never lost a race , and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary ."
"But in my mind , this was my way to make a difference , to disrupt the status quo ."
"The polls , however , told a very different story ."
"My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run , that there was no way that I could win ."
"But I ran anyway , and in 2012 , I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race ."
I swore I was going to win .
"I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News , the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day , and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country ."
"I raised money from everyone I knew , including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running ."
"But on election day , the polls were right , and I only got 19 percent of the vote , and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes ."
Don &apos;t do the math .
It was humiliating .
"Now , before you get the wrong idea , this is not a talk about the importance of failure ."
Nor is it about leaning in .
"I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave , where I didn &apos;t worry about being perfect ."
"And I &apos;m not alone : so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they &apos;re going to be great in , that they know they &apos;re going to be perfect in , and it &apos;s no wonder why ."
Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure .
"We &apos;re taught to smile pretty , play it safe , get all A &apos;s ."
"Boys , on the other hand , are taught to play rough , swing high , crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst ."
"And by the time they &apos;re adults , whether they &apos;re negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date , they &apos;re habituated to take risk after risk ."
They &apos;re rewarded for it .
"It &apos;s often said in Silicon Valley , no one even takes you seriously unless you &apos;ve had two failed start-ups ."
"In other words , we &apos;re raising our girls to be perfect , and we &apos;re raising our boys to be brave ."
"Some people worry about our federal deficit , but I , I worry about our bravery deficit ."
"Our economy , our society , we &apos;re just losing out because we &apos;re not raising our girls to be brave ."
"The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM , in C-suites , in boardrooms , in Congress , and pretty much everywhere you look ."
"In the 1980s , psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them ."
She found that bright girls were quick to give up .
"The higher the IQ , the more likely they were to give up ."
"Bright boys , on the other hand , found the difficult material to be a challenge ."
They found it energizing .
They were more likely to redouble their efforts .
What &apos;s going on ?
"Well , at the fifth grade level , girls routinely outperform boys in every subject , including math and science , so it &apos;s not a question of ability ."
The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge .
And it doesn &apos;t just end in fifth grade .
"An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications , but women , women will apply only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications ."
100 percent .
"This study is usually invoked as evidence that , well , women need a little more confidence ."
"But I think it &apos;s evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection , and they &apos;re overly cautious ."
"( Applause ) And even when we &apos;re ambitious , even when we &apos;re leaning in , that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers ."
"And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing and tech , women are being left behind , and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect ."
"( Applause ) So in 2012 , I started a company to teach girls to code , and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave ."
"Coding , it &apos;s an endless process of trial and error , of trying to get the right command in the right place , with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure ."
"Code breaks and then it falls apart , and it often takes many , many tries until that magical moment when what you &apos;re trying to build comes to life ."
It requires perseverance .
It requires imperfection .
"We immediately see in our program our girls &apos; fear of not getting it right , of not being perfect ."
Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story .
"During the first week , when the girls are learning how to code , a student will call her over and she &apos;ll say , &quot; I don &apos;t know what code to write . &quot;"
"The teacher will look at her screen , and she &apos;ll see a blank text editor ."
"If she didn &apos;t know any better , she &apos;d think that her student spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen ."
"But if she presses undo a few times , she &apos;ll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it ."
"She tried , she came close , but she didn &apos;t get it exactly right ."
"Instead of showing the progress that she made , she &apos;d rather show nothing at all ."
Perfection or bust .
"It turns out that our girls are really good at coding , but it &apos;s not enough just to teach them to code ."
"My friend Lev Brie , who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students ."
"When the guys are struggling with an assignment , they &apos;ll come in and they &apos;ll say , &quot; Professor , there &apos;s something wrong with my code . &quot;"
"The girls will come in and say , &quot; Professor , there &apos;s something wrong with me . &quot;"
"We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection , but we &apos;ve got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone ."
Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system .
"I can &apos;t tell you how many women tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to raise my hand , I &apos;m afraid to ask a question , because I don &apos;t want to be the only one who doesn &apos;t understand , the only one who is struggling ."
"When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on , they will build incredible things , and I see this every day ."
"Take , for instance , two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run — yes , Tampon Run — to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming ."
Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls .
Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy &apos;s life because he has cancer .
"These are just three examples of thousands , thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect , who have learned to keep trying , who have learned perseverance ."
"And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé , they will not defer their dreams ."
And those dreams have never been more important for our country .
"For the American economy , for any economy to grow , to truly innovate , we cannot leave behind half our population ."
"We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection , and we &apos;ve got to do it now ."
We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old .
"We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers , when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others , and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous ."
"And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know — your sister , your niece , your employee , your colleague — to be comfortable with imperfection , because when we teach girls to be imperfect , and we help them leverage it , we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"Chris Anderson : Reshma , thank you ."
It &apos;s such a powerful vision you have . You have a vision .
Tell me how it &apos;s going .
How many girls are involved now in your program ?
"Reshma Saujani : Yeah . So in 2012 , we taught 20 girls ."
"This year we &apos;ll teach 40,000 in all 50 states ."
"( Applause ) And that number is really powerful , because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science ."
"Like , the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly ."
"CA : And you &apos;re working with some of the companies in this room even , who are welcoming graduates from your program ?"
"RS : Yeah , we have about 80 partners , from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney , I mean , every single company out there ."
"And if you &apos;re not signed up , I &apos;m going to find you , because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office ."
"CA : And you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams , good things happen ."
RS : Great things happen .
"I mean , I think that it &apos;s crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women ."
Women use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men .
"We own the Internet , and we should be building the companies of tomorrow ."
"And I think when companies have diverse teams , and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams , they build awesome things , and we see it every day ."
"CA : Reshma , you saw the reaction there . You &apos;re doing incredibly important work ."
This whole community is cheering you on . More power to you . Thank you .
RS : Thank you .

"And I think , jeez , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !"
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smart enough .
And there &apos;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
"I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people — in the villages , in the slums , in the hinterland of the country — who have solved problems through their own genius , without any outside help ."
"When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India , about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable , he missed the point ."
"The point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years , the point that people may be economically poor , but they &apos;re not poor in the mind ."
"In other words , the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds ."
"That is the message , which we started 31 years ago ."
And what did it start ?
"Let me just tell you , briefly , my personal journey , which led me to come to this point ."
"In &apos; 85 , &apos; 86 , I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands , on the fields of the poor people , and how to develop research technologies , which are based on the knowledge of the people ."
I came back in &apos; 86 .
"I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country , which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity ."
"I started looking at my own work : The work that I had done for the previous 10 years , almost every time , had instances of knowledge that people had shared ."
"Now , I was paid in dollars as a consultant , and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself : &quot; &quot; Is there a line in my return , which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ?"
"Was it because I &apos;m brilliant that I &apos;m getting this reward , or because of the revolution ?"
Is it that I write very well ?
Is it that I articulate very well ?
Is it that I analyze the data very well ?
"Is it because I &apos;m a professor , and , therefore , I must be entitled to this reward from society ? &quot; &quot; I tried to convince myself that , &quot; &quot; No , no , I have worked for the policy changes ."
"You know , the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor , and , therefore I think it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; But it appeared to me that all these years that I &apos;d been working on exploitation — exploitation by landlords , by moneylenders , by traders — gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter , because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people — those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me — and nothing ever went back to them ."
"So much so , that much of my work till that time was in the English language ."
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn &apos;t know English .
So what kind of a contributor was I ?
"I was talking about social justice , and here I was , a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act — of taking knowledge from the people , making them anonymous , getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy , writing papers and publishing them in the papers , getting invited to the conferences , getting consultancies and whatever have you ."
"So then , a dilemma rose in the mind that , if I &apos;m also an exploiter , then this is not right ; life cannot go on like that ."
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn &apos;t live with it any longer .
"So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research , wrote , read about 100 papers ."
"And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique , dilemma is not unique ; the solution had to be unique ."
"And one day — I don &apos;t know what happened — while coming back from the office towards home , maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee , life would be wonderful ."
"What the honey bee does : it pollinates , takes nectar from the flower , pollinates another flower , cross-pollinates ."
"And when it takes the nectar , the flowers don &apos;t feel shortchanged ."
"In fact , they invite the honey bees through their colors , and the bees don &apos;t keep all the honey for themselves ."
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network : that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language .
They must not remain anonymous .
"And I must tell you that after 20 years , I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art ."
That is a great tragedy — which I &apos;m carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you — that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous .
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K.
"or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people , you must share back with them ."
"We are talking about an accountable society , a society that is fair and just , and we don &apos;t even do justice in the knowledge market ."
And India wants to be a knowledge society .
How will it be a knowledge society ?
"So , obviously , you cannot have two principles of justice , one for yourself and one for others ."
It must be the same .
You cannot discriminate .
"You cannot be in favor of your own values , which are at a distance from the values that you espouse ."
"So , fairness to one and to the other is not divisible ."
Look at this picture .
"Can you tell me where has it been taken from , and what is it meant for ? Anybody ?"
I &apos;m a professor ; I must quiz you . ( Laughter ) Anybody ? Any guess at all ?
Pardon ? ( Audience Member : Rajasthan . ) Anil Gupta : But what has it been used for ? What has it been used for ?
( Murmuring ) Pardon ?
"You know , you &apos;re so right . We must give him a hand , because this man knows how insensitive our government is ."
Look at this . This is the site of the government of India .
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country .
I &apos;m so sorry to say that .
Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture ?
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people .
"If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be celebrating that ."
We should be doing something about it .
"And let me tell you , with all the science and technology at our command , millions of women still carry water on their heads ."
And we do not ask this question .
You must have taken tea in the morning .
Think for a minute .
"The leaves of the tea , plucked from the bushes ; you know what the action is ? The action is : The lady picks up a few leaves , puts them in the basket on the backside ."
Just do it 10 times ; you will realize the pain in this shoulder .
And she does it a few thousand times every day .
"The rice that you ate in the lunch , and you will eat today , is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture , millions of them , every season , in the paddy season , when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water ."
"And feet in the water will develop fungus , infections , and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point ."
"And every year , 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually ."
No machines have been developed .
"So the silence of scientists , of technologists , of public policy makers , of the change agent , drew our attention that this is not on , this is not on ; this is not the way society will work ."
"This is not what our parliament would do . You know , we have a program for employment : One hundred , 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country ."
"Doing what ? Breaking stones , digging earth ."
So we asked a question to the parliament : Do poor have heads ?
"Do poor have legs , mouth and hands , but no head ?"
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich .
And what has happened ?
"An anonymous , faceless , nameless person gets in contact with the network , and then gets an identity ."
This is what Honey Bee Network is about .
"And this network grew voluntarily , continues to be voluntary , and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative ."
"They could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity , the innovations , either in terms of contemporary innovations , or in terms of traditional knowledge ."
And it all begins with curiosity .
It all begins with curiosity .
"This person , whom we met — and you will see it on the website , www.sristi.org — this tribal person , he had a wish ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If my wish gets fulfilled &quot; &quot; — somebody was sick and he had to monitor — &quot; &quot; God , please cure him ."
"And if you cure him , I will get my wall painted . &quot; &quot; And this is what he got painted ."
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy .
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .
"Kabir , Rahim , all the great Sufi saints , they were all poor people , and they had a great reason . ( Applause ) Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment ."
"Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment , only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something ."
Look at this .
We saw it in Shodh Yatra . Every six months we walk in different parts of the country .
"I &apos;ve walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years ."
"So on the wayside we found these dung cakes , which are used as a fuel ."
"Now , this lady , on the wall of the dung cake heap , has made a painting ."
That &apos;s the only space she could express her creativity .
And she &apos;s so marvelous .
"Look at this lady , Ram Timari Devi , on a grain bin . In Champaran , we had a Shodh Yatra and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy , pain of indigo growers ."
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura .
Look at what she has done .
The whole wall is her canvas . She &apos;s sitting there with a broom .
Is she an artisan or an artist ?
Obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person .
"If we can create markets for these artists , we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones ."
"They will be paid for what they are good at , not what they &apos;re bad at ."
( Applause ) Look at what Rojadeen has done .
"In Motihari in Champaran , there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and , obviously , there &apos;s a limited market for tea ."
"Every morning you have tea , as well as coffee ."
"So he thought , why don &apos;t I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine ?"
So this is a coffee machine . Just takes a few hundred rupees .
"People bring their own cooker , he attaches a valve and a steam pipe , and now he gives you espresso coffee . ( Laughter ) Now , this is a real , affordable coffee percolator that works on gas ."
( Applause ) Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done .
A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground .
So this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler .
"If you have 500 grams , 1000 , one kilogram , he will grind it for it for you ; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity ."
Please understand the problem of poor people .
"They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy , in terms of cost , in terms of quality ."
"They don &apos;t want second-standard , second-quality outputs ."
But to be able to give them high-quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs .
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did .
"But that &apos;s not enough , what he did . Look at what he did here ."
"If you have clothes , and you don &apos;t have enough time to wash them , he brought a washing machine to your doorstep , mounted on a two-wheeler ."
So here &apos;s a model where a two-wheeler washing machine ...
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep .
"( Applause ) You bring your water , you bring your soap , I wash the clothes for you . Charge 50 paisa , one rupee for you per lot , and a new business model can emerge ."
"Now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up ."
Look at this .
It looks like a beautiful photograph .
But you know what it is ? Can anybody guess what it is ?
"Somebody from India would know , of course ."
It &apos;s a tawa .
It &apos;s a hot plate made of clay .
"Now , what is the beauty in it ?"
"When you have a non-stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars ."
This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick ; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials .
"And the best part is that , while you use a costly non-stick pan , you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears . Where has it gone ?"
"It has gone in your stomach . It was not meant for that . ( Laughter ) You know ? But here in this clay hot plate , it will never go into your stomach ."
"So it is better , it is safer ; it is affordable , it is energy-efficient ."
"In other words , solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper , need not be , so-called , jugaad , need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement ."
"They have to be better , they have to be more efficient , they have to be affordable ."
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done .
He has designed this plate with a handle .
"And now with one dollar , you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you ."
"This lady , she developed a herbal pesticide formulation ."
"We filed the patent for her , the National Innovation Foundation ."
"And who knows ? Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products , and she would get revenue ."
"Now , let me mention one thing : I think we need a polycentric model of development , where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country , in different parts of the world , would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner ."
"Higher the local fit , greater is the chance of scaling up ."
"In the scaling up , there &apos;s an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people , point by point , with the supply that you &apos;re making ."
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ?
"Things can scale up , and they have scaled up ."
"For example , cell phones : We have 400 million cellphones in this country ."
"Now , it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone , only three options on the cellphone ."
"It has 300 options , I &apos;m paying for 300 ; I &apos;m using only three but I &apos;m willing to live with it , therefore it is scaling up ."
"But if I had to get a match to match , obviously , I would need a different design of a cellphone ."
So what we &apos;re saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability .
"There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality , and yet , one can be able to fund them ."
"One of the greatest studies that we &apos;ve been finding is that many times investors would ask this question — &quot; &quot; What is a scalable model ? &quot; &quot; — as if the need of a community , which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places , has no legitimate right to get them for free because it &apos;s not part of a larger scale ."
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out .
"Now , the eminent model , the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books , for example , having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model ."
"And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio , will invest in the portfolio , where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities , and yet , the overall platform of the model will become viable ."
Look at what he is doing .
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man .
"At the age of 70 , he is linking up something very creative ."
( Music ) Saidullah Sahib : I couldn &apos;t wait for the boat .
I had to meet my love .
My desperation made me an innovator .
Even love needs help from technology .
"Innovation is the light of my wife , Noor ."
New inventions are the passion of my life .
My technology .
"( Applause ) AG : Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari , again in Champaran ."
"Wonderful human being , but he stills sells , at this age , honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood , because we haven &apos;t been able to convince the water park people , the lake people , in &#91; unclear &#93; operations ."
"And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai — where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers , wading in the water — that , look , you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go , where your transport will not go ."
"So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device , as a vending device during the floods in eastern India , when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they &apos;re marooned ."
But the idea has a merit . The idea has a merit .
"What has Appachan done ? Appachan , unfortunately , is no more , but he has left behind a message ."
A very powerful message Appachan : I watch the world wake up every day .
"( Music ) It &apos;s not that a coconut fell on my head , and I came upon this idea ."
"With no money to fund my studies , I scaled new heights ."
"Now , they call me the local Spiderman ."
My technology .
"( Applause ) AG : Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally — what I call a G2G model , grassroots to global ."
"And a professor in the University of Massachusetts , in the zoology department , bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy ."
"And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms , rather than only a few , because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her &#91; unclear &#93; would climb on that ."
"So , you know , we are advancing the frontiers of science ."
Remya Jose has developed ...
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos .
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th : a washing machine-cum-exercising machine .
"Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only ."
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .
This innovation is from the slums of Rio .
"And this person , Mr. Ubirajara ."
"We were talking about , my friends in Brazil , how we scale up this model in China and Brazil ."
"And we have a very vibrant network in China , particularly , but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world ."
"This stand on the front wheel , you will not find on any cycle ."
India and China have the largest number of cycles .
But this innovation emerged in Brazil .
"The point is , none of us should be parochial , none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country ."
"No , we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people , wherever they are ."
"And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations : cycle that &apos;s a sprayer , cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road ."
"I can &apos;t change the condition of the road , but I can make the cycle run faster ."
That is what Kanak Das has done .
"And in South Africa , we had taken our innovators , and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have ."
And this is a donkey cart which they modified .
"There &apos;s an axle here , of 30 , 40 kg , serving no purpose ."
"Remove it , the cart needs one donkey less ."
This is in China . This girl needed a breathing apparatus .
"These three people in the village sat down and decided to think , &quot; How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village ? &quot;"
"They were not related to her , but they tried to find out , &quot; How can we use ... &quot; They used a cycle , they put together a breathing apparatus ."
"And this breathing apparatus now saved the life , and she &apos;s very welcome ."
There &apos;s a whole range of innovations that we have .
"A car , which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer ."
"Assam , Kanak Gogoi ."
"And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe , but this is available in India ."
"Now , this lady , she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree ."
"In one day , 18,000 times , she had to do this winding to generate two sarees ."
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle .
"She said , &quot; &quot; Change your profession . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t . This is the only thing I know , but I &apos;ll invent a machine , which will solve your problem . &quot; &quot; And this is what he did , a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh ."
"So , this is what SRISTI is saying : &quot; Give me a place to stand , and I will move the world . &quot;"
"I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity , a whole range of things ."
"We have sold things all over the world , from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever ."
"Products have gone to the market , a few ."
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible .
"And here , a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it , it asks the user , &quot; &quot; You can also be an innovator ."
"If you have an idea , send it back to us . &quot; &quot; So , creativity counts , knowledge matters , innovations transform , incentives inspire ."
"And incentives : not just material , but also non-material incentives ."
Thank you .

Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood .
"But I &apos;ll tell you later , if you want to know ."
"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use digital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TEDTalks ."
"Instead , I have progressed , and I am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA : this box ."
This box contains one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people ."
"In the developing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they lived away then .
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
"In the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families ."
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
"And in 1960 , all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this ."
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
"But in contrast to this , in the developing world , far away , the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day ."
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up .
"And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the West &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the Developing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the West ."
"A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here ."
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them ."
They are now buying cars .
"And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company , Geely , they acquired the Volvo company , and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; richer also &#93; have ."
"And their aspiration now is , of course , to buy a bicycle , and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any gap ."
"But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever ."
"But there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying — there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 ."
"I was in Shanghai recently , and I listened to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as Japan did ."
All the projections &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"&#91; But this second &#93; grows with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start flying .
"And these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically ."
"And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology — so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; among emerging economies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing ."
"So these &#91; poorest &#93; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the poorest &#93; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
The yellow on there is the Americas ; dark blue is Africa ; brown is Europe ; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
"Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big families , small families ."
The year is 1960 .
"And down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion Western world here — high child-survival , small families — and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"Can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?"
"They get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . Family size is decreasing ."
"&#91; When &#93; they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there &#91; to small families &#93; ."
"Look , Bangladesh catching up with India ."
"The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion ."
"Can you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; boxes I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation ."
And the population will double in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
"That &apos;s why investments by Gates Foundation , UNICEF and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world ."
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
Child survival is the new green .
It &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an optimist , neither am I a pessimist ."
"I &apos;m a very serious &quot; &quot; possibilist . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old West .
"Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

Contagious is a good word .
"Even in the times of H1N1 , I like the word ."
Laughter is contagious . Passion is contagious .
Inspiration is contagious .
We &apos;ve heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers .
"But for me , what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the &quot; &quot; I Can &quot; &quot; bug ."
"So , the question is , why only them ?"
"In a country of a billion people and some , why so few ?"
Is it luck ? Is it chance ?
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected ?
"So , in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story ."
"I got infected when I was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me ."
"And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt , and how contagious that feeling was ."
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven .
"So , when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab , a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the &quot; &quot; I Can &quot; &quot; bug ."
"And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context , that if you blur the boundaries between school and life , then children go through a journey of &quot; &quot; aware , &quot; &quot; where they can see the change , &quot; &quot; enable , &quot; &quot; be changed , and then &quot; &quot; empower , &quot; &quot; lead the change ."
And that directly increased student wellbeing .
"Children became more competent , and less helpless ."
But this was all common sense .
"So , I &apos;d like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside ."
"A little background : when my grade five was learning about child rights , they were made to roll incense sticks , agarbattis , for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer ."
"It transformed them . What you will see is their journey , and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world ."
( Music ) That &apos;s them rolling .
"And in two hours , after their backs were broke , they were changed ."
"And once that happened , they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished ."
"And look at Ragav , that moment when his face changes because he &apos;s been able to understand that he has shifted that man &apos;s mindset ."
And that can &apos;t happen in a classroom .
"So , when Ragav experienced that he went from &quot; &quot; teacher told me , &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; I am doing it . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the &quot; &quot; I Can &quot; &quot; mindshift ."
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured .
"But we had parents who said , &quot; &quot; Okay , making our children good human beings is all very well , but what about math and science and English ?"
Show us the grades . &quot; &quot; And we did . The data was conclusive .
"When children are empowered , not only do they do good , they do well , in fact very well , as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India , Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math , English and science ."
"So , it worked . It was now time to take it outside Riverside ."
"So , on August 15th , Independence Day , 2007 , the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad ."
Now it was not about Riverside school .
"It was about all children . So , we were shameless ."
"We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation , the police , the press , businesses , and basically said , &quot; &quot; When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child ?"
When will you include the child in the city ?
"Basically , open your hearts and your minds to the child . &quot; &quot; So , how did the city respond ?"
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood .
"Here was a city telling its child , &quot; &quot; You can . &quot; &quot; A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad ."
"Video : &#91; Unclear &#93; So , the busiest streets closed down ."
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us .
It gets taken over by children .
They are skating . They are doing street plays .
"They are playing , all free , for all children ."
( Music ) Atul Karwal : aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city .
( Music ) Kiran Bir Sethi : And the city will give free time .
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .
"Geet Sethi : When a city gives to the children , in the future the children will give back to the city ."
"( Music ) KBS : And because of that , Ahmedabad is known as India &apos;s first child-friendly city ."
"So , you &apos;re getting the pattern . First 200 children at Riverside ."
"Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad , and growing ."
It was time now to infect India .
"So , on August 15th , again , Independence Day , 2009 , empowered with the same process , we empowered 100,000 children to say , &quot; &quot; I can . &quot; &quot; How ? We designed a simple toolkit , converted it into eight languages , and reached 32,000 schools ."
We basically gave children a very simple challenge .
"We said , take one idea , anything that bothers you , choose one week , and change a billion lives ."
"And they did . Stories of change poured in from all over India , from Nagaland in the east , to Jhunjhunu in the west , from Sikkim in the north , to Krishnagiri in the south ."
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems .
"Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism , and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan ."
"I mean , it was incredible ."
"Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say , &quot; &quot; You can , &quot; &quot; then they will ."
Infection in India .
"This is in Rajasthan , a rural village ."
Child : Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
"KBS : First time , a rally and a street play in a rural school — unheard of — to tell their parents why literacy is important ."
Look at what their parents says .
Man : This program is wonderful .
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write .
Woman : I am so happy that my students did this campaign .
"In the future , I will never doubt my students &apos; abilities ."
See ? They have done it .
KBS : An inner city school in Hyderabad .
Girl : 581 . This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555 .
"KBS : Girls and boys in Hyderabad , going out , pretty difficult , but they did it ."
"Woman : Even though they are so young , they have done such good work ."
"First they have cleaned the society , then it will be Hyderabad , and soon India ."
Woman : It was a revelation for me . It doesn &apos;t strike me that they had so much inside them .
"Girl : Thank you , ladies and gentlemen ."
"For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids ."
"Are you ready , ladies and gentlemen ? Audience : Yes !"
Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes ! Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes !
"KBS : So , the charter of compassion starts right here . Street plays , auctions , petitions . I mean , they were changing lives . It was incredible . So , how can we still stay immune ? How can we stay immune to that passion , that energy , that excitement ? I know it &apos;s obvious ,"
"but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change , Gandhiji ."
"70 years ago , it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of &quot; &quot; We can . &quot; &quot; So , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India ?"
"Last I heard , the preamble still said , &quot; &quot; We , the people of India , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"So , if not us , then who ?"
"If not now , then when ?"
"Like I said , contagious is a good word ."
Thank you .

"If you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here ."
"So let &apos;s pull up , now , something else ."
This is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .
"This is a project called Photosynth , which marries two different technologies ."
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
"And so these are all Flickr images , and they &apos;ve all been related spatially in this way ."
We can just navigate in this very simple way .
Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered .
It &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
"One way to change our genes is to make new ones , as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown ."
Another is to change our lifestyles .
"And what we &apos;re learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be , that you don &apos;t have to wait very long to see the benefits ."
"When you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen ."
"But more than that , your brain gets measurably bigger ."
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now .
This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us .
"Now , there &apos;s some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells ."
"Some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blueberries , alcohol in moderation , stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana ."
I &apos;m just the messenger .
( Laughter ) What were we just talking about ? ( Laughter )
"And other things that can make it worse , that can cause you to lose brain cells ."
"The usual suspects , like saturated fat and sugar , nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress ."
"Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle , so you age less quickly . Your skin doesn &apos;t wrinkle as much ."
Your heart gets more blood flow .
We &apos;ve shown that you can actually reverse heart disease .
"That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left , after only a year become measurably less clogged ."
"And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left , the blue means no blood flow ."
A year later — orange and white is maximum blood flow .
"We &apos;ve shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and , by extension , breast cancer , simply by making these changes ."
"We &apos;ve found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70 percent in the group that made these changes , whereas only nine percent in the comparison group ."
These differences were highly significant .
"Even your sexual organs get more blood flow , so you increase sexual potency ."
"One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services , showing that nicotine , which constricts your arteries , can cause a heart attack or a stroke , but it also causes impotence ."
Half of guys who smoke are impotent .
How sexy is that ?
Now we &apos;re also about to publish a study — the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .
"This is what &apos;s called a heat map — and the different colors — and along the side , on the right , are different genes ."
"And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed — in effect , turning on the good genes , the disease-preventing genes , turning off the disease-promoting genes ."
"And so these findings I think are really very powerful , giving many people new hope and new choices ."
"And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe , that are giving you your genetic profiles , are giving some people a sense of , &quot; &quot; Gosh , well , what can I do about it ? &quot; &quot; Well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes — they &apos;re a predisposition — but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise , we can actually change how our genes are expressed ."
Thank you .

"About a year ago , I asked myself a question : &quot; &quot; Knowing what I know , why am I not a vegetarian ? &quot; &quot; After all , I &apos;m one of the green guys : I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin ."
I started a site called TreeHugger — I care about this stuff .
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third .
"Cruelty : I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypocritically , wouldn &apos;t even consider for our own cats , dogs and other pets ."
"Environmentally , meat , amazingly , causes more emissions than all of transportation combined : cars , trains , planes , buses , boats , all of it ."
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do .
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
"So what was once the special little side treat now is the main , much more regular ."
"So really , any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian ."
"Yet , there I was — chk , chk , chk — tucking into a big old steak ."
So why was I stalling ?
I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution .
"It was either you &apos;re a meat eater or you &apos;re a vegetarian , and I guess I just wasn &apos;t quite ready ."
Imagine your last hamburger .
"( Laughter ) So my common sense , my good intentions , were in conflict with my taste buds ."
"And I &apos;d commit to doing it later , and not surprisingly , later never came ."
Sound familiar ?
"So I wondered , might there be a third solution ?"
"And I thought about it , and I came up with one ."
"I &apos;ve been doing it for the last year , and it &apos;s great ."
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
The name says it all : Nothing with a face Monday through Friday .
"On the weekend , your choice ."
Simple .
"If you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats ."
"So you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish ."
"It &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there ."
"After all , cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake ."
"The program has been great , weekday veg ."
"My footprint &apos;s smaller , I &apos;m lessening pollution , I feel better about the animals , I &apos;m even saving money ."
"Best of all , I &apos;m healthier , I know that I &apos;m going to live longer , and I &apos;ve even lost a little weight ."
"So , please ask yourselves , for your health , for your pocketbook , for the environment , for the animals : What &apos;s stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot ?"
"After all , if all of us ate half as much meat , it would be like half of us were vegetarians ."
Thank you .

"I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times ."
"I &apos;m giving a short slide show this morning that I &apos;m giving for the very first time , so — well it &apos;s — I don &apos;t want or need to raise the bar , I &apos;m actually trying to lower the bar ."
Because I &apos;ve cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session .
"And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong &apos;s fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior ."
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
How dare we be optimistic ?
"Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture ."
"As Mahatma Gandhi famously said , &quot; You must become the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;"
"And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone , except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior . But the word &quot; &quot; behavior &quot; &quot; is also , I think , sometimes misunderstood in this context ."
"I &apos;m a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids , and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house , and dug the geothermal wells , and did all of that other stuff ."
"But , as important as it is to change the lightbulbs , it is more important to change the laws ."
"And when we change our behavior in our daily lives , we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part . In order to be optimistic about this , we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy ."
"In order to solve the climate crisis , we have to solve the democracy crisis ."
And we have one .
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time .
"I was reminded of that recently , by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at , just staring at me as she walked past . She was in her 70s , looked like she had a kind face . I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction , also just staring at me . And so I said , &quot; &quot; How do you do ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you dyed your hair black , you would look just like Al Gore . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Many years ago , when I was a young congressman , I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge"
of nuclear arms control — the nuclear arms race .
"And the military historians taught me , during that quest , that military conflicts are typically put into three categories : local battles , regional or theater wars , and the rare but all-important global , world war — strategic conflicts ."
"And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources , a different approach , a different organizational model ."
"Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste dumps . But there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast , and from Western Europe to the Arctic , and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico ."
"And there are lots of those . But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global , or strategic , conflict ."
"Everything is affected . And we have to organize our response appropriately . We need a worldwide , global mobilization for renewable energy , conservation , efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy ."
"We have work to do . And we can mobilize resources and political will . But the political will has to be mobilized , in order to mobilize the resources ."
Let me show you these slides here .
"I thought I would start with the logo . What &apos;s missing here , of course , is the North Polar ice cap ."
"Greenland remains . Twenty-eight years ago , this is what the polar ice cap — the North Polar ice cap — looked like at the end of the summer , at the fall equinox ."
"This last fall , I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colorado , and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory ."
This is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
"To put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record ."
Here &apos;s what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers .
"The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically — doesn &apos;t look quite the same size — but it is exactly the same size as the United States , minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona ."
The amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi .
"The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much . It comes back in the winter , but not as permanent ice , as thin ice — vulnerable . The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years ."
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland .
"Already , around the Arctic Circle — this is a famous village in Alaska . This is a town in Newfoundland . Antarctica . Latest studies from NASA ."
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California .
"&quot; &quot; They were the best of times , they were the worst of times &quot; &quot; : the most famous opening sentence in English literature . I want to share briefly a tale of two planets . Earth and Venus are exactly the same size . Earth &apos;s diameter is about 400 kilometers larger , but essentially the same size ."
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
"But the difference is , on Earth , most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere , deposited in the ground as coal , oil , natural gas , etc . On Venus , most of it is in the atmosphere . The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average . On Venus , it &apos;s 855 . This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible , and putting it into the atmosphere ."
It &apos;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
"It &apos;s three times hotter than Mercury , which is right next to the Sun . Now , briefly , here &apos;s an image you &apos;ve seen , as one of the only old images , but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI : Climate ."
"The global scientific community says : man-made global warming pollution , put into the atmosphere , thickening this , is trapping more of the outgoing infrared ."
"You all know that . At the last IPCC summary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; How certain are you ? &quot; They wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;"
"The Chinese objected , and so the compromise was &quot; more than 90 percent . &quot;"
"Now , the skeptics say , &quot; &quot; Oh , wait a minute , this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun . &quot; &quot; If that were true , the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere , if it &apos;s more coming in ."
"If it &apos;s more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . Here is the lower atmosphere ."
Here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
CSI : Climate .
"Now , here &apos;s the good news . Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming . Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way . There has been progress , but here is the key : when given a list of challenges to confront , global warming is still listed at near the bottom ."
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
"If you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?"
"Well , the Alliance for Climate Protection , which I head in conjunction with Current TV — who did this pro bono — did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this ."
This is the winner .
"NBC — I &apos;ll show all of the networks here — the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates : two of them were about the climate crisis . ABC : 844 questions , two about the climate crisis ."
Fox : two . CNN : two . CBS : zero .
From laughs to tears — this is one of the older tobacco commercials .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries . And us .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
"The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace . And actually , their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965 . And they &apos;re catching up very dramatically . The total concentrations : by 2025 , they will be essentially where we were in 1985 ."
"If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture , we would still have this crisis ."
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . This is in Bolivia — over thirty years .
This is peak fishing in a few seconds . The &apos; 60s .
&apos;70s . &apos; 80s . &apos; 90s . We have to stop this . And the good news is that we can .
We have the technologies .
"We have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution ."
"People say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the solution ? &quot; &quot; Here it is ."
"Put a price on carbon . We need a CO2 tax , revenue neutral , to replace taxation on employment , which was invented by Bismarck — and some things have changed since the 19th century ."
"In the poor world , we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis ."
"Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted , if we do not solve the climate crisis ."
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe .
"This was from Nature magazine . These are concentrating solar , renewable energy plants , linked in a so-called &quot; &quot; supergrid &quot; &quot; to supply all of the electrical power to Europe , largely from developing countries — high-voltage DC currents ."
This is not pie in the sky ; this can be done .
We need to do it for our own economy .
"The latest figures show that the old model is not working . There are a lot of great investments that you can make . If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil , then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets ."
And it is based on an old model .
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse . Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent . Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense .
"I have a stake in these , so I &apos;ll have a disclaimer there ."
"But geothermal , concentrating solar , advanced photovoltaics , efficiency and conservation ."
"You &apos;ve seen this slide before , but there &apos;s a change ."
The only two countries that didn &apos;t ratify — and now there &apos;s only one . Australia had an election .
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there .
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia .
"Lot of other things contributed to it , but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia &apos;s position on Kyoto , and he has . Now , they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had ."
"This is Lake Lanier . My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names , we &apos;d call the one in the southeast now Katrina , and we would say it &apos;s headed toward Atlanta ."
We can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture .
Here &apos;s more good news . The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
"are up to 780 — and I thought I saw one go by there , just to localize this — which is good news ."
"Now , to close , we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine ."
"What we need is another hero generation . Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice — just as Jill &#91; Bolte &#93; Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through ."
We now have a culture of distraction .
But we have a planetary emergency .
"And we have to find a way to create , in the generation of those alive today , a sense of generational mission ."
I wish I could find the words to convey this .
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
Another that ended slavery . And that gave women the right to vote .
We can do this . Don &apos;t tell me that we don &apos;t have the capacity to do it .
"If we had just one week &apos;s worth of what we spend on the Iraq War , we could be well on the way to solving this challenge ."
We have the capacity to do it .
"One final point : I &apos;m optimistic , because I believe we have the capacity , at moments of great challenge , to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us ."
"Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is so terrible ."
What a burden we have . &quot; &quot; I would like to ask you to reframe that . How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts ?
"A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do ? I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which , a thousand years from now , philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying , they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future ."
Let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
"Chris Anderson : For so many people at TED , there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form — one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn &apos;t being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true ."
That hurts .
"Al Gore : You have no idea . ( Laughter ) CA : When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now — I mean , there &apos;s — are you excited by their plans on global warming ?"
"AG : The answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee — certain nominee — John McCain , and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination — all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis . All three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . But the campaign dialogue that — as illustrated by the questions —"
"that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters , by the way , the analysis of all the questions — and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label , &quot; &quot; Clean Coal . &quot; &quot; Has anybody noticed that ?"
"Every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; &quot; Clean Coal . &quot; &quot; &quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;"
The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed .
"So they &apos;re saying the right things and they may — whichever of them is elected — may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when I came back from Kyoto in 1997 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that breakthrough there , and then confronted the United States Senate , only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm , to ratify that treaty . Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say ."
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
"CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization , literally ."
"And now we mechanized that process . Changing that pattern requires a scope , a scale , a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past ."
"So that &apos;s why I began by saying , be optimistic in what you do , but be an active citizen ."
"Demand — change the light bulbs , but change the laws . Change the global treaties ."
We have to speak up . We have to solve this democracy — this — We have sclerosis in our democracy . And we have to change that .
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
Connect with people . Become very active as citizens .
"Have a moratorium — we shouldn &apos;t have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren &apos;t able to capture and store CO2 , which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources ."
"Now , nobody is talking on that scale . But I do believe that between now and November , it is possible ."
"This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign — grassroots mobilization , television ads , Internet ads , radio , newspaper — with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen ."
We need help . We need help .
"CA : In terms of your own personal role going forward , Al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?"
AG : I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question . What can I do ?
"Buckminster Fuller once wrote , &quot; &quot; If the future of all human civilization depended on me , what would I do ?"
"How would I be ? &quot; &quot; It does depend on all of us , but again , not just with the light bulbs ."
"We , most of us here , are Americans . We have a democracy ."
"We can change things , but we have to actively change ."
What &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
And that &apos;s hard to — that &apos;s hard to create — but it is coming .
"There &apos;s an old African proverb that some of you know that says , &quot; &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together . &quot; &quot; We have to go far , quickly ."
So we have to have a change in consciousness .
A change in commitment . A new sense of urgency .
A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
"CA : Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED ."
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .
"Ten years ago exactly , I was in Afghanistan ."
"I was covering the war in Afghanistan , and I witnessed , as a reporter for Al Jazeera , the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that ."
"Then , two years later , I covered another war — the war in Iraq ."
I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq .
"And the war ended with a regime change , like the one in Afghanistan ."
"And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship , an authoritarian regime , that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation , within the people themselves ."
"However , the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world ."
"For decades , we have lived under authoritarian regimes — in the Arab world , in the Middle East ."
These regimes created something within us during this period .
I &apos;m 43 years old right now .
"For the last 40 years , I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us — old , aged , authoritarian , corrupt situations — regimes that we have seen around us ."
"And for a moment I was wondering , are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground , a change that does not come through foreign intervention , through the misery of occupation , through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes ?"
"The Iraqis : yes , they got rid of Saddam Hussein , but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad , they felt that their dignity had suffered ."
And this is why they revolted .
This is why they did not accept .
"And actually other regimes , they told their citizens , &quot; &quot; Would you like to see the situation of Iraq ?"
"Would you like to see civil war , sectarian killing ?"
Would you like to see destruction ?
"Would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? &quot; &quot; And the people thought for themselves , &quot; &quot; Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in , instead of having the second scenario . &quot; &quot; That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen ."
"For 10 years , unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction , images of killing , of sectarian conflicts , images of violence , emerging from a magnificent piece of land , a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years ."
Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived .
"A new generation , well-educated , connected , inspired by universal values and a global understanding , has created a new reality for us ."
"We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams : these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world , who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets ."
Nothing happened . No violence . Nothing .
"Just step out of your house , raise your voice and say , &quot; &quot; We would like to see the end of the regime . &quot; &quot; This is what happened in Tunisia ."
"Over a few days , the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies , billions of dollars in maintaining , trying to maintain , its prisons , collapsed , disappeared , because of the voices of the public ."
"People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices , they tried to kill ."
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .
They found something called Facebook .
They found something called Twitter .
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
"And they said , &quot; These kids are misled . &quot;"
"Therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home ."
This is what they were telling . This is their propaganda .
"&quot; &quot; Bring these kids home because they are misled . &quot; &quot; But yes , these youth who have been inspired by universal values , who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and , at the same time , realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it — not using violence , not trying to create chaos — these young people , they did not go home ."
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them .
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia .
"We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years , and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there ."
"But we found that these people in the street , all of them are our reporters , feeding our newsroom with pictures , with videos and with news ."
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people — people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority .
And then we took that decision : We are unrolling the news .
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people .
We are going to spread the message .
"Yes , some of these young people are connected to the Internet , but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little , is very small , because of many problems that we are suffering from ."
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified &#91; it &#93; .
"We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world — and internationally , globally , through our English channel ."
And then people started to feel that there &apos;s something new happening .
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave .
"And then Egypt started , and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave ."
And now Libya as you see it .
And then you have Yemen .
"And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of , &quot; &quot; How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant ? &quot; &quot; I want to tell you something , that the Internet and connectivity has created &#91; a &#93; new mindset ."
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from .
"And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us — and even sometimes it was true — that change was imposed on us , and people rejected that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture ."
"Always , we believed that change will spring from within , that change should be a reconciliation with culture , cultural diversity , with our faith in our tradition and in our history , but at the same time , open to universal values , connected with the world , tolerant to the outside ."
And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world .
"This is the right moment , and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region ."
How did the elite deal with that — the so-called political elite ?
"In front of Facebook , they brought the camels in Tahrir Square ."
"In front of Al Jazeera , they started creating tribalism ."
"And then when they failed , they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world ."
"They started telling the West , &quot; &quot; Be aware of Al-Qaeda ."
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories .
These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras .
"Be aware of these people who &#91; are &#93; coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization . &quot; &quot; Fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived ."
Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception .
"They could not , and they cannot , imagine how they could really deal with this reality ."
They have lost .
"They have been detached from their people , from the masses , and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other ."
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution .
We do not create revolutions .
"However , when something of that magnitude happens , we are at the center of the coverage ."
"We were banned from Egypt , and our correspondents , some of them were arrested ."
"But most of our camera people and our journalists , they went underground in Egypt — voluntarily — to report what happened in Tahrir Square ."
"For 18 days , our cameras were broadcasting , live , the voices of the people in Tahrir Square ."
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone — ordinary person who I don &apos;t know — from Tahrir Square .
"He told me , &quot; &quot; We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras ."
"If you switch off the cameras tonight , there will be a genocide ."
"You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square . &quot; &quot; I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them , &quot; &quot; Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night , because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story — and they feel protected as well . &quot; &quot; So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world ."
We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world .
"Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran , of &#91; the &#93; Mosaddeq revolution ."
"Let us free ourselves — especially in the West — from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest , or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security ."
The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction .
Let us accept the choice of the people .
Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future .
"The future should be ruled by people themselves , even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us ."
"But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world , for the West and the East , to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world , rather than the images of violence and terrorism ."
Let us support these people .
Let us stand for them .
"And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change , and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance ."
"The future has arrived , and the future is now ."
I thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
Chris Anderson : I just have a couple of questions for you .
Thank you for coming here .
How would you characterize the historical significance of what &apos;s happened ?
"Is this a story-of-the-year , a story-of-the-decade or something more ?"
"Wadah Khanfar : Actually , this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered ."
We have covered many wars .
"We have covered a lot of tragedies , a lot of problems , a lot of conflict zones , a lot of hot spots in the region , because we were centered at the middle of it ."
But this is a story — it is a great story ; it is beautiful .
It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident .
You are witnessing change in history .
You are witnessing the birth of a new era .
And this is what the story &apos;s all about .
"CA : There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical , or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos ."
"You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now , that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you &apos;ve spoken about so inspiringly ?"
"WK : And people actually , after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime , the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils , they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy , but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational , not to go out of order ."
"In my opinion , these people are much more wiser than , not only the political elite , even the intellectual elite , even opposition leaders including political parties ."
"At this moment in time , the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old — including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes ."
( Applause ) CA : We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way .
"What should people here at TED , here in the West , do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what &apos;s happening here ?"
"WK : I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world — that people care , people care about this great transformation ."
"Mohamed Nanabhay who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of Aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world ."
Fifty percent of it is coming from America .
"Because we discovered that people care , and people would like to know — they are receiving the stream through our Internet ."
"Unfortunately in the United States , we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English ."
"But I can tell you , this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling , universal feeling , of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us ."
"CA : Well Wadah , a group of members of the TED community , TEDxCairo , are meeting as we speak ."
They &apos;ve had some speakers there .
I believe they &apos;ve heard your talk .
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
Thank you so much .

"After all , take a look at these events : Imperialism and colonization , world wars , George W. Bush ."
"Ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible ? Adults ."
"Now , what have kids done ?"
"Well , Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust ."
Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States .
"Now , if you don &apos;t trust someone , you place restrictions on them , right ?"
"Now , what &apos;s even worse than restriction , is that adults often underestimate kids &apos; abilities ."
"Thank you , Bill Gates , and thank you , Ma ."
"Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published , or saying wait until you &apos;re older , my parents were really supportive ."
One large children &apos;s publisher ironically said that they didn &apos;t work with children .
Kids grow up and become adults just like you .
It &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the Dark Ages anymore .
"Now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas ."
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
How many of you love rhythm ?
"Oh yeah , oh yeah . Oh yeah . ( Cheers ) ( Drumming ) I mean , I love all kinds of rhythm ."
"I like to play jazz , a little funk , and hip hop , a little pop , a little R &amp; B , a little Latin , African ."
"And this groove right here , comes from the Crescent City , the old second line ."
"( Cheers ) Now , one thing all those rhythms have in common is math , and I call it a-rhythm-etic ."
Can you repeat after me ? A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
Clayton Cameron : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm a-rhythm . Audience : A-rhythm a-rhythm .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : Yeah .
Now all those styles of rhythm are all counted in four and then subdivided by three .
What ?
Yeah . Three is a magic number .
Three is a groovin &apos; number .
Three is a hip-hop kind of number .
But what does subdividing by three mean ?
And counting off by four ?
"Well , look , think of it this way ."
A measure of music as a dollar .
"Now a dollar has four quarters , right ?"
And so does a 4 / 4 measure of music .
It has four quarter notes .
"Now , how do you subdivide ?"
Now let &apos;s envision this : three dollars &apos; worth of quarters .
"You would have three groups of four , and you would count it , a-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four . Together ."
"All : A-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four ."
"CC : Okay , now you feel that ?"
Now let &apos;s take those three groups of four and make them four groups of three .
And listen to this .
"A-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , with me ."
"One-two-three-four , one-two-three , come on , y &apos;all !"
"All : One-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , ah ."
CC : There you go .
"All right , second line ."
"One-two-three-four , one-two-three . One-two-three-four , one-two-three . One-two-three-four , one-two-three ."
"One-two-three-four , one-two-three . Yeah . Now , that &apos;s what I call a-rhythm-etic . Can you say it ? A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic . CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic . CC : A-rhythm a-rhythm . Audience : A-rhythm a-rhythm ."
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
"CC : Yeah . Now pick the swing beat , and do the same thing . One , two , one , two , a-one-two-three-four . Yeah . Mm . One-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three . Whoo . So I want to take the second line beat and the swing beat and put them together ,"
and it sounds something like this .
Aha .
A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm a-rhythm . Audience : A-rhythm a-rhythm .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : Yeah . Hip-hop .
Now it &apos;s using a faster group of three we call a triplet .
Triplet-triplet . Say it with me .
All : Triplet-triplet .
CC : Triplet-triplet . Triplet-triplet .
"CC : So I &apos;ll take all the rhythms that you heard earlier , we &apos;ll put them together , and they sound like this ."

"Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent ."
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
"The arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system ."
It expands in winter and contracts in summer .
The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
The permanent ice is marked in red .
"As you see , it expands to the dark blue — that &apos;s the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer ."
"The so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here ."
"In 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this ."
"This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes ."
"Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point ."
"Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water ."
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter .
Video : Whoa ! ( Laughter ) Al Gore : She &apos;s okay . The question is whether we will be .
"And one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north ."
This is an annual melting river .
But the volumes are much larger than ever .
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
These flows are increasing very rapidly .
"At the other end of the planet , Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet ."
Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
"And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting ."
"That &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Greenland ."
"In the Himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers ."
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
"In the Andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city ."
The flows have increased .
"But when they go away , so does much of the drinking water ."
In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack .
This is hitting the reservoirs .
"And the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious ."
This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .
Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
This is a completely unsustainable pattern .
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours — 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
"Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific , from the Americas , extending westward , and on either side of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans ."
"The biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels ."
"Oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem ."
"The United States is one of the two largest emitters , along with China ."
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
But we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
( Applause ) However there is a political battle in our country .
"And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron ."
That image reminded me of something .
"( Laughter ) Around Christmas , in my home in Tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled ."
You probably saw it on the news .
"This , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America ."
This happened around Christmas .
One of the coal industry &apos;s ads around Christmas was this one .
"Video : ♪ ♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul ."
"He &apos;s abundant here in America , and he helps our economy grow ."
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
"He &apos;s affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay ."
Al Gore : This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia .
The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal .
"Video : Don Blankenship : Let me be clear about it . Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about ."
Al Gore : So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns .
"This is one of them , part of one of them ."
Video : Actor : At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
"The fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty ."
"We think it &apos;s clean — smells good , too ."
So don &apos;t worry about climate change .
Leave that up to us .
( Laughter ) Video : Actor : Clean coal — you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
So let &apos;s take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility .
Amazing ! The machinery is kind of loud .
But that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
"And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything ."
Take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
"Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge ."
"Video : Narrator : America is in crisis — the economy , national security , the climate crisis ."
"The thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil ."
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
"A plan to put America back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming ."
"Finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems ."
Repower America . Find out more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : Narrator : It &apos;s about repowering America .
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
"Man : Future &apos;s over here . Wind , sun , a new energy grid ."
Man # 2 : New investments to create high-paying jobs .
Narrator : Repower America . It &apos;s time to get real .
"Al Gore : There is an old African proverb that says , &quot; &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone ."
"If you want to go far , go together . &quot; &quot; We need to go far , quickly ."
Thank you very much .

"Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr . , in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement , states , &quot; &quot; In the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . &quot; &quot; As a teacher , I &apos;ve internalized this message ."
"Every day , all around us , we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination , violence , genocide and war ."
"In the classroom , I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry ."
"We work together to fill those spaces , to recognize them , to name them , to understand that they don &apos;t have to be sources of shame ."
"In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences , I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class , which every student signs at the beginning of the year : read critically , write consciously , speak clearly , tell your truth ."
"And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point , tell your truth ."
"And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up , I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so ."
"So I tell them that growing up , as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans , during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up , sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity ."
"I &apos;ve given up soda , McDonald &apos;s , French fries , French kisses , and everything in between ."
"But one year , I gave up speaking ."
"I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice , but it was like I hadn &apos;t realized that I had given that up a long time ago ."
"I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to , told myself I wasn &apos;t meant to be anyone &apos;s conscience because I still had to figure out being my own , so sometimes I just wouldn &apos;t say anything , appeasing ignorance with my silence , unaware that validation doesn &apos;t need words to endorse its existence ."
"When Christian was beat up for being gay , I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as if I didn &apos;t even notice ."
I couldn &apos;t use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing .
I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one .
When the woman at the fundraising gala said &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you .
"It must be so hard teaching those poor , unintelligent kids , &quot; &quot; I bit my lip , because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity ."
We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don &apos;t .
Silence is the residue of fear .
It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue .
It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn &apos;t feel safe in your lungs .
Silence is Rwandan genocide . Silence is Katrina .
It is what you hear when there aren &apos;t enough body bags left .
It is the sound after the noose is already tied .
It is charring . It is chains . It is privilege . It is pain .
There is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you .
I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision .
"I will tell Christian that he is a lion , a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance ."
"I will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was , because sometimes all people want to be is human ."
"I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau , and just because you watched one episode of &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t mean you know anything about my kids ."
"So this year , instead of giving something up , I will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue , a stage on the underside of my inhibition ."
Because who has to have a soapbox when all you &apos;ve ever needed is your voice ?
Thank you .

I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .
"We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent , but insufficient in three major ways ."
"It is , first of all , profoundly unequal : half the world &apos;s people still living on less than two dollars a day ; a billion people with no access to clean water ; two and a half billion no access to sanitation ; a billion going to bed hungry every night ; one in four deaths every year from AIDS , TB , malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water — 80 percent of them under five years of age ."
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .
"In the United States , since 2001 we &apos;ve had five years of economic growth , five years of productivity growth in the workplace , but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent ."
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent .
"So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us — which is why we &apos;re all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living , enjoying this evening — is profoundly unequal ."
It is also unstable .
"Unstable because of the threats of terror , weapons of mass destruction , the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren &apos;t not so many years ago ."
"And perhaps most important of all , it is unsustainable because of climate change , resource depletion and species destruction ."
"When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have , it is a world that moves away from unequal , unstable , unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities — locally , nationally and globally — that share the characteristics of all successful communities : a broadly shared , accessible set of opportunities , a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging ."
All easier said than done .
"When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago , I think even though they didn &apos;t claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9 / 11 , I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with , went to school with , worked with , shared weekends with , shared meals with ."
"In other words , they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity ."
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century .
"Into this mix , people like us , who are not in public office , have more power to do good than at any time in history , because more than half the world &apos;s people live under governments they voted in and can vote out ."
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion .
"Because primarily of the power of the Internet , people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree ."
"When the tsunami hit South Asia , the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars ."
30 percent of our households gave .
Half of them gave over the Internet .
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars .
"And thirdly , because of the rise of non-governmental organizations ."
"They , businesses , other citizens &apos; groups , have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings ."
"When I became president in 1993 , there were none of these organizations in Russia ."
There are now a couple of hundred thousand .
None in India . There are now at least a half a million active .
"None in China . There are now 250,000 registered with the government , probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons ."
"When I organized my foundation , and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation , and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on ."
"I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty , fight disease , combat climate change , bridge the religious , racial and other divides that torment the world , but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more ."
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs .
"And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort , and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I &apos;ll make tonight , Ira Magaziner , is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he &apos;s done ."
He &apos;s over there .
"( Applause ) When I got out of office and was asked to work , first in the Caribbean , to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis , generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year ."
"If you bought them in vast bulks , you could get them at a little under 400 dollars ."
"The first country we went to work in , the Bahamas , was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs ."
The market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold .
"So the very first week we were working , we got the price down to 500 dollars ."
"And all of a sudden , they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money ."
"Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines , one of whom was cited in the film , and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy , because even at 500 dollars , these drugs were being sold on a high-margin , low-volume , uncertain-payment basis ."
"So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain , and went to a low-margin , high-volume , absolutely certain-payment business ."
I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy .
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
"And pretty soon , the average price was 192 dollars ."
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars .
"Children &apos;s medicine was 600 dollars , because nobody could afford to buy any of it ."
We negotiated it down to 190 .
"Then , the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID , got a bunch of other countries to help ."
That children &apos;s medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year .
"The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose , treat and care for people and deliver this medicine ."
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America .
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
We just reorganized the markets .
"And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets ."
"And that is now what we &apos;re trying to do , and working with this large cities group to fight climate change , to negotiate huge , big , volume deals that will enable cities which generate 75 percent of the world &apos;s greenhouse gases , to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics ."
"And this whole discussion as if it &apos;s some sort of economic burden , is a mystery to me ."
I think it &apos;s a bird &apos;s nest on the ground .
"When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for the &quot; &quot; Inconvenient Truth &quot; &quot; movie , I was thrilled , but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly ."
"For those of you who saw &quot; &quot; An Inconvenient Truth , &quot; &quot; the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one , which shows here &apos;s where greenhouse gases are going if we don &apos;t do anything , here &apos;s where they could go ."
And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory .
We need a movie on those six categories .
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .
So we &apos;re trying to do that .
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .
"Now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish ."
"It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be — the pessimistic headlines may say , well , we can &apos;t do this , that or the other thing because of corruption — I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption , and feeds corruption ."
"We now have the money , given these low prices , to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach ."
"Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work , and in a total of 62 countries , and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them ."
But the money is there to reach others .
The systems are not there to reach the people .
"So what we have been trying to do , working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places — but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight — is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS , TB , malaria , other infectious diseases , maternal and child health , and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world , that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda , and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world ."
"And the test is : one , will it do the job ?"
Will it provide high quality care ?
"And two , will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years ?"
"Because the longer I deal with these problems , the more convinced I am that we have to — whether it &apos;s economics , health , education , whatever — we have to build systems ."
And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight .
"You think about whatever your life has been , however many obstacles you have faced in your life , at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved ."
"In a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there ."
"And it becomes almost impossible to save lives , educate kids , develop economies , whatever ."
"The person , in my view , who has done the best job of this in the health care area , of building a system in a very poor area , is Dr. Paul Farmer , who , many of you know , has worked for now 20 years with his group , Partners in Health , primarily in Haiti where he started , but they &apos;ve also worked in Russia , in Peru and other places around the world ."
"As poor as Haiti is , in the area where Farmer &apos;s clinic is active — and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve — since 1988 , they have not lost one person to tuberculosis , not one ."
And they &apos;ve achieved a lot of other amazing health results .
"So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem , we wanted to build a healthcare network , because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994 , and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day ."
"So I rang up , asked Paul Farmer if he would help ."
"Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country , number one , it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years , and number two , we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world ."
And so we have set about doing that .
"Now , we started working together 18 months ago ."
"And we &apos;re working in an area called Southern Kayonza , which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda , with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people ."
"We &apos;re essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti : he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems , ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly , who work on bringing about health education , clean water and sanitation , providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it ."
"The procedures that make this work have been perfected , as I said , by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years ."
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda .
"And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country , and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it ."
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit about our team because it &apos;s indicative of what we do .
"We have about 500 people around the world working in our AIDS program , some of them for nothing — just for transportation , room and board ."
And then we have others working in these other related programs .
"Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble , who is an unusually gifted woman , but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work ."
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s .
She was CEO of a successful e-venture — she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures — and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life .
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country .
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it .
"When we came to this rural area , 45 percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition ."
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five .
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent .
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation — all entirely preventable and treatable .
"Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses — again , all preventable and treatable ."
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis .
"Within the first 18 months , the following things happened : we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS ."
That &apos;s 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area .
Listen to this : less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .
That &apos;s lower than the figure in the United States .
Less than three-tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs .
"400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system ."
That &apos;s about 43 percent of all the pregnancies .
"About 40 percent of all the people — I said 400,000 . I meant 40,000 ."
"About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it — in just 18 months , up from zero when we started ."
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow .
We &apos;ve started the first malaria treatment programs they &apos;ve ever had there .
"Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics , complete with solar power generators , good lab technology ."
"We now are treating 325 people a month , despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home ."
"And the most important thing is because we &apos;ve implemented Paul Farmer &apos;s model , using community health workers , we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP , and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years ."
"And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP on health care , except for the United States , we spend 16 — but that &apos;s a story for another day ."
( Laughter ) We &apos;re now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up .
We &apos;re also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho .
"And we have similar projects in Tanzania , Mozambique , Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing : to save as many lives as quickly as we can , but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world ."
"We need initial upfront investment to train doctors , nurses , health administration and community health workers throughout the country , to set up the information technology , the solar energy , the water and sanitation , the transportation infrastructure ."
"But over a five- to 10-year period , we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out ."
"My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high-quality rural health system in a poor country , Rwanda , that can be a model for Africa , and indeed , for any poor country anywhere in the world ."
"My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorists , with more productive citizens and fewer haters , a place we &apos;d all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in ."
"It has been an honor for me , particularly , to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter , the Scottish philanthropist , where last year we , using the same thing with AIDS drugs , cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers ."
"These people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me , helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other ."
"We &apos;re undoing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future ."
We &apos;re doing this in an environmentally responsible way .
"I &apos;m doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the 35 percent of the people that have no access , but to do it with clean energy . To have responsible reforestation projects , the Rwandans , interestingly enough , have been quite good , Mr. Wilson , in preserving their topsoil ."
There &apos;s a couple of guys from southern farming families — the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they &apos;d done with it .
"We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation , reorganize itself , focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive , quality health care with minimal outside help ."
"I am grateful for this prize , and I will use it to that end ."
"We could use some more help to do this , but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system in Rwanda — in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income , one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth ."
It &apos;s worth a try and I believe it would succeed .
Thank you and God bless you .
