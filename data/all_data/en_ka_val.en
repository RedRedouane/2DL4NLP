"When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house ."
"My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio ."
"There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him ."
&quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school ."
It was the only way we both could be educated .
"Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going ."
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room ."
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
"We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents ."
"From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious ."
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
"A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father ."
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
"She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
"There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks ."
"To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children ."
"During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life ."
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will ."
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
"Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them ."
"Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College ."
"( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me ."
"He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul ."
( Applause ) My family believes in me .
"I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women ."
"That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school ."
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
"And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition ."
"Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students ."
"Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes ."
"As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men ."
"Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan ."
( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
"But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change ."
"To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that ."
"Like me , they are dreaming big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Just absolutely amazing , every single dive ."
Disappears right into the background .
"So , he &apos;s bluffing . Let &apos;s do it backwards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution ."
"If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated ."
"Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky ."
"Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant ."
"We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division ."
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
So I started planning how to help them escape .
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
We made this kindergarten to be a circle .
It &apos;s a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
"If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles ."
This is how the rooftop looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a handrail . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?"
"So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a handrail . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the trees .
There are three trees popping through .
And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
"But of course , rope has nothing to do with them ."
They fall into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
"The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge ."
It looks so nice from underneath .
Monkeys in the zoo .
( Laughter ) Feeding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof ."
"And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling ."
And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
"You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal ."
"But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he &apos;s putting water into his boots ."
"( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
"When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous ."
"But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous ."
Because there is no boundary .
"And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secondly , we consider noise very important ."
You know that children sleep better in noise .
They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
"And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class ."
"And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise ."
They need noise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar ."
You are not supposed to be in silence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
In summer you go swimming .
The sand is 50 degrees .
"And also , you should know that you are waterproof ."
You never melt in rain .
"So , children are supposed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divide classrooms .
They are supposed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A classroom .
And there are always some trees in the classroom .
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
And each classroom has at least one skylight .
And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
"This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten ."
The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
"And of course , the ceiling height is very low ."
So you have to consider safety .
"So , we put our children , a daughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
And then we put other children .
"The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive ."
"Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger ."
"And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
"Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning ."
But the surprise is yet to come .
"The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average ."
And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
"The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof ."
Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes ."
They need to get some injury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
"Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?"
"So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math ."
"I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition ."
"So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all ."
"I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate ."
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
"To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories ."
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
"For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach ."
"This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields ."
"This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S."
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher ."
"So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom ."
One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
Students lack perseverance .
"They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale ."
"There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
This is really destructive .
"David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this ."
"He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly ."
"You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple ."
I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
It applies equally to math .
"Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
"And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit ."
"And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula ."
"You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame ."
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
"But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving ."
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
"You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing ."
"You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving ."
"So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?"
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
"So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever ."
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
"And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily ."
"And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means ."
"And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure ."
"The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together ."
"Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?"
"It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues ."
"He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
"First things first , we eliminate all the substeps ."
"Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those ."
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that ."
"Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?"
Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up ."
"And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly ."
It &apos;s tedious .
"Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition ."
"Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation ."
"We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here ."
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition ."
"We , instead , just watch the end of the movie ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical ."
"But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable ."
So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
"These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun ."
"We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is ."
This has been a lot of fun .
"I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
"It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous ."
"I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks ."
"I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that ."
"Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow ."
"I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items ."
"And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this ."
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
"So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum ."
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
"And unless you &apos;ve been on Mars recently , you know there &apos;s a lot of that out there ."
"But let &apos;s face it , there &apos;s a lot of bunk ."
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
"I brought this with me , this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test ."
It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
It &apos;s called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod .
( Laughter ) This was being sold to high-school administrators for $ 900 apiece .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
So it looks something like this .
I &apos;ll show you .
"( Laughter ) Well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias ."
"Well , this is science , so we &apos;ll do a controlled experiment ."
It &apos;ll go this way for sure .
"( Laughter ) Sir , do you want to empty your pockets , please , sir ? ( Laughter )"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in science , we have to keep track of the misses , not just the hits ."
"And that &apos;s probably the key lesson to my short talk here : This is how psychics work , astrologers , tarot card readers and so on ."
People remember the hits and forget the misses .
"In this case , we tested it ."
"We had two opaque boxes : one with government-approved THC marijuana , and one with nothing ."
And it got it 50 percent of the time — ( Laughter ) which is exactly what you &apos;d expect with a coin-flip model .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
&quot; &quot; Skeptic &quot; &quot; is the quarterly publication . Each one has a particular theme .
This one is on the future of intelligence .
Are people getting smarter or dumber ?
Sort of an interesting thing .
"With science , don &apos;t think of skepticism as a thing , or science as a thing ."
Are science and religion compatible ?
"It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?"
Science is not a thing . It &apos;s a verb .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about things .
It &apos;s a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
"Before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it &apos;s not in this world ."
( Laughter ) The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon .
"For those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; &quot; Then a miracle occurs ."
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two . &quot; &quot; This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments .
There &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
There &apos;s nothing to test .
It &apos;s the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists .
It &apos;s the beginning of the causal chain for science .
"For intelligent design creationists , it &apos;s the end of the chain ."
"So again , we can ask this : what &apos;s more likely ?"
"Are UFOs alien spaceships , or perceptual cognitive mistakes , or even fakes ?"
"This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena , California , looking down over Pasadena ."
"And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is ."
"You don &apos;t even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment , you don &apos;t need computers ."
This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera .
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
Camera &apos;s ready — that &apos;s it .
"( Laughter ) So , although it &apos;s possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on , and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles ."
"In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn ."
"First of all , there was no theory of planetary rings ."
So he wrote that he had seen — &quot; I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . &quot;
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .
"So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data , you can &apos;t have a good theory ."
It wasn &apos;t solved until 1655 .
"And we see the angles of the rings at different angles , there ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
"So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things , on a simple level , and then I &apos;ll go to more serious ones ."
"Like , we have a tendency to see faces ."
"In 1976 , where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians ."
Here &apos;s the close-up of it from 2001 .
"If you squint , you can still see the face ."
"And when you &apos;re squinting , you &apos;re turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain , so you &apos;re reducing the quality of your data ."
"You see the happy face on Mars , there ."
"( Laughter ) If astronomers were frogs , perhaps they &apos;d see Kermit the Frog ."
Religious iconography .
( Laughter ) Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996 .
He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa &apos;s lawyer .
"Here &apos;s Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville , just down the street , or is it up the street from here ?"
"Tree bark is particularly good because it &apos;s nice and grainy , branchy , black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking — humans are pattern-seeking animals ."
"Here &apos;s when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich — which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino — of course , this being America ."
"( Laughter ) This casino paid $ 28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich . ( Laughter )"
But who does it really look like ? The Virgin Mary ? ( Laughter )
"It has that sort of puckered lips , 1940s-era look ."
"Virgin Mary in Clearwater , Florida ."
There was a lot of people there .
"The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches , and so on ."
We went down and investigated .
"Just to give you a size , that &apos;s Dawkins , me and The Amazing Randi , next to this two , two and a half story-sized image ."
"All these candles , thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this ."
"So we walked around the backside , to see what was going on ."
"It turns out wherever there &apos;s a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect ."
"Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off ."
I guess you can only have one miracle per building .
"( Laughter ) So is it really a miracle of Mary , or is it a miracle of Marge ? ( Laughter )"
"And now I &apos;m going to finish up with another example of this , with auditory illusions ."
"( Laughter ) In this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena ."
There &apos;s a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff .
This is the most famous one of all of these .
Here &apos;s the forward version of the very famous song .
( Music ends ) Couldn &apos;t you just listen to that all day ?
"All right , here it is backwards , and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there ."
( Music with unintelligible lyrics ) ( Lyrics ) Satan !
( Music with lyrics ) ( Music ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You can &apos;t miss it when I tell you what &apos;s there . ( Laughter )
"I &apos;m going to just end with a positive , nice little story ."
The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization .
We &apos;re always looking for little good things that people do .
"One of the top popular singers in England today , Katie Melua ."
And she wrote a beautiful song .
And she has this one passage here .
"( Music ) ( Lyrics ) We are 12 billion light-years from the edge That &apos;s a guess , No one can ever say it &apos;s true , But I know that I will always be with you ."
"Michael Shermer : Well , that &apos;s nice . At least she got it close ."
"You know , it &apos;s 13.7 billion light years , and it &apos;s not a guess ."
We know within precise error bars how close it is .
"So we can say , although not absolutely true , it &apos;s pretty close to being true ."
So I will end with the new version .
( Music with lyrics ) We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe .
That &apos;s a good estimate with well-defined error bars .
"And with the available information , I predict that I will always be with you ."
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
( Applause )
Thank you .
"Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania ."
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"On the stage that day , I was so nervous ."
"My English lost , I wanted to vomit ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"All sisters , excepting me ."
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
"Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers ."
"Like everyone else , we grew maize ."
One year our fortune turned very bad .
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
"My family ate one meal per day , at night ."
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
The food passes through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
"In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees ."
"Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education ."
So I went to a library .
"I read books , science books , especially physics ."
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
"Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials ."
"Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes ."
"Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell ."
Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
"( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an airplane before .
I had never slept in a hotel .
"So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams ."
God bless .
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , trust yourself and believe ."
"Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
"This , for example , is my tumble dryer ."
"Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
"Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value ."
"And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Values are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering ."
"Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects ."
"And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes ."
"Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
Probably not .
"Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not ."
"There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths ."
And morality relates to these truths .
"So , in talking about values we are talking about facts ."
"Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
"Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain ."
"So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains ."
"And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc ."
"So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings ."
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective ."
"And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access ."
And these await our discovery .
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
"Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future ."
"For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin ."
"And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year ."
"The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
"The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 ."
"But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?"
"Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed ."
"And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?"
"Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health ."
The concept of physical health is undefined .
"As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years ."
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
"( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous ."
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
"The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition ."
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
"So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth ."
Why would we think this ?
"Consider , by analogy , the game of chess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow ."
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity ."
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere ."
Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
"Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned ."
"But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?"
"Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her ."
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society ."
"For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world ."
"Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?"
"Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance ."
"( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape ."
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
"Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being ."
"In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
"Now , what stands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types ."
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness ."
"On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women ."
"So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science ."
"He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Edward Witten .
He &apos;s a string theorist .
"If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus ."
It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory ."
I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
"How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves"
that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts ."
"It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering ."
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
"We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them ."
"It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes ."
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there ."
"Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them ."
Language seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags ."
"I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;"
"Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?"
"And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under ."
"And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa ."
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
But can you reconcile that ?
"I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same ."
"Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness ."
"SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for grabs ."
It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
"CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?"
"SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus ."
"CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street ."
"This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names ."
"Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed ."
"So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names ."
Blocks have names .
"Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ."
"All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight ."
"There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy ."
"So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four ."
"But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this map is also accurate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true ."
"So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true ."
