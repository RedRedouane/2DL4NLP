Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Huh . Hang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar technology is ...
"Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?"
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake ."
Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
Even the BBC and The New York Times .
"So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication ."
"When we think about communication , we think about interactions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
"And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date ."
"For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued ."
"If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?"
"We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology ."
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics ."
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
"So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up ."
It &apos;s about opening up .
"This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them ."
"So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?"
"When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out ."
"You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it ."
I notice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
"Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising ."
"And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade ."
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
"So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?"
"And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
"So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
"But really , power is also about how you react to stress ."
"So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?"
"Probably not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind ."
"So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
"So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
"So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"Also , our bodies change our minds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations ."
"Again , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled ."
People hate this .
"We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them ."
They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect ."
"So I said , fake it till you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
"When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident ."
"I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times ."
I was thrown from the car .
"I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college ."
I am an impostor .
"You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling ."
"Like , she can fake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it ."
Fake it till you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
"Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take ."
"And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
My friend looks at me totally blankly .
There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the abstract .
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
"The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present tense is where we live ."
We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
"So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make ."
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
Dreadful . Thumbs down .
"Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great ."
"Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question ."
You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
"In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly ."
"But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him ."
And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
That &apos;s when he falls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground ."
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness ."
I call this error blindness .
"Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
Think back for a moment to elementary school .
"You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not mine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper ."
"It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework ."
"So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes ."
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers ."
"Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out ."
"Okay , so fine ."
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
"Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery ."
Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
"She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room ."
Everything seems to have gone fine .
"And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one ."
"When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous ."
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy ."
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions ."
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
"They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes ."
So this is a catastrophe .
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring ."
The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this ."
"And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;"
"Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome ."
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
"Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out ."
"To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity ."
"Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life ."
"And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
"I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show ."
"And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme ."
"And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up ."
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East ."
And something else happened instead .
"And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us ."
"No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
"( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
"The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder ."
"And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know ."
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
"These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses ."
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
"We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects ."
The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
"Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war ."
"These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war ."
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
"During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations ."
"Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities , when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army ."
The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
"Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group ."
As much as genocide is about killing .
"It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed ."
Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
"These items are recovered from numerous mass graves , and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust ."
Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
"Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored ."
Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
"These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials ."
"Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process ."
"Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orphans of the narrative ."
"Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
"As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community ."
I like to move beyond raising awareness .
"And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened ."
"Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy ."
"In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document ."
"Once all the missing persons are identified , only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain ."
"In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed ."
Thank you very much .

I am for chocolate donuts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
It &apos;s awful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun ."
( Applause )
"In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland went on a strike ."
They marched into the center of Reykjavík — 90 percent of women participated — and peacefully and in solidarity asked for equality .
"Nothing worked in Iceland that day , because nothing works when women are not at work ."
"I will never forget this day , that President Vigdís , as we know her by her first name , stepped out on the balcony of her own home , a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won ."
"( Applause ) This woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time , including boys ."
"She frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her after a couple of terms in office and asked , &quot; &quot; Can boys really grow up to be president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Role models really matter , but even with such strong role models who I am so grateful for , when I was encouraged to run for president , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I to run for president ?"
Who am I to be president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men .
"So a study done in the US in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men had considered running for office , but 45 percent of women ."
"That &apos;s gap of 16 percentage points , and it &apos;s the same gap that existed a decade earlier ."
And it was the journey of my life .
It was amazing .
The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates .
"It boiled down to nine candidates qualifying , and ultimately the race came down to four of us , three men and me ."
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the drama yet .
Then later he changed his mind when our prime minister resigned following the infamous Panama Papers that implicated him and his family .
"And there was a popular protest in Iceland , so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader ."
"So on May 9 , 45 days before election day , it was not looking too good for me ."
I did not even make the graph in the newspaper .
"The polls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had earned ."
"So it would be an understatement to say that I had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table and access to television , because the network decided that they would only include those with 2.5 percent or more in the polls in the first TV debate ."
"I found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate that I would participate along with the three men , and I found out on live TV that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first TV debate ."
"( Applause ) So , challenges ."
"The foremost challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with media , muscle and money ."
Let &apos;s start with media .
There are those who say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
It proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media .
And I am not saying media is doing this consciously .
"But media really matters , and every time I appeared on TV , we saw and experienced a rise in the polls , so I know firsthand how much this matters and why we have to talk about it ."
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates and out of coverage about the elections .
I got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit .
( Applause ) So kudos to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
"When access to media proved to be so difficult , we ran our own media ."
I ran live Facebook sessions where I took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot .
"And when reaching young voters proved to be challenging , I became a Snapchatter ."
"I got young people to teach me how to do that , and I used every filter on Snapchat during the last part of the campaign ."
"And I actually had to use a lot of humor and humility , as I was very bad at it ."
But we grew the following amongst young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different type of campaign .
"But unfortunately , one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money ."
"I am sad that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less financial resources than the other candidates ."
This probably was partly due to the fact that I think I had a harder time asking for financial support .
And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less .
Some would call that very womanly of me .
"But even with one third the media , one third the financial resources , and only an entrepreneurial team , but an amazing team , we managed to surprise everyone on election night , when the first numbers came in ."
"I surprised myself , as you may see in that photo ."
"( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I came in neck to neck to the leading candidate ."
"( Cheers ) Well , too early , because I didn &apos;t quite pull that , but I came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with nearly a third of the vote , and we beat the polls by an unprecedented margin , or 10 percentage points above what the last poll came in at ."
"Some people call me the real winner of the election because of this , and there are many people who encouraged me to run again ."
"( Applause ) She is 13 , and she had never been on TV before ."
"And on election day , I observed her on TV repeatedly , and she was smart , she was self-confident , she was sincere , and she was supportive of her mother ."
This was probably the highlight of my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
Audience : Aw !
This picture was really enough of a win for me .
"What we see , we can be ."
So screw fear and challenges .
"( Applause ) It matters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for office , be it the office of the CEO or the office of the president ."
"I also managed to put an impression on your very own &quot; &quot; New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I earned a new title , &quot; &quot; A living emoji of sincerity . &quot; &quot; ( Cheers ) It is possibly my proudest title yet , and the reason is that women too often get penalized for using what I call their emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that ."
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
"We celebrated as if we had won on election night , because that &apos;s how we felt ."
So you don &apos;t necessarily have to reach that office .
"You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow beyond anything you will experience before ."
"So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this journey , probably more lessons than I can share here in the time we have today ."
"But rest assured , it was hard work ."
I lost a lot of sleep during those months .
"It took resilience and perseverance to not quit , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are truly , authentically listening to your own voice and working in alignment with that ."
"As a good sister of mine sometimes says , you may cheat on your intuition , but your intuition never cheats on you ."
"As a matter of fact , the leading PR expert told me before I made my decision that I would do well to get seven percent ."
"I appreciated his perspective , because he was probably right , and he was basing it on valuable experience ."
"It &apos;s very important to mention this , because I did lose a lot of sleep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me ."
"I took a lot of support from others in doing this , and I made the decision to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s partly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this ."
"I called it a 4G campaign , the G &apos;s representing the Icelandic words ."
"Second one is &quot; &quot; Gleði , &quot; &quot; or joy ."
I decided to enjoy the journey .
"I kept no secrets , and it was all open , on Facebook and websites ."
"Last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we ran on the principle of Girlpower ."
"I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my entire team will agree with me , that it was worth it ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not letting you go yet . Halla Tómasdóttir : What a great crowd . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
"And then what you may not know because our American media did not report it , the Icelandic women walked out again on Monday . Right ?"
"HT : Yes , they did . PM : Can you tell us about that ?"
"HT : Yes , so 41 years after the original strike , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done ."
( Applause )
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House , and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago ."
"This little boy is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; Daddy , when I grow up , I want to be a former president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great blessing as a former president , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"Not only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have visited more than 145 countries in the world , and the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa ."
"So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is , strangely , not addressed quite often , is the abuse of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reasons for this that I &apos;ll mention to begin with .
"First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures , holy scriptures , in the Bible , Old Testament , New Testament , Quran and so forth , and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques ."
And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very serious problem . It &apos;s ordinarily not addressed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 2000 , I had been a Baptist , a Southern Baptist for 70 years — I tell you , I still teach Sunday school every Sunday ; I &apos;ll be teaching this Sunday as well — but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position , a subservient position to men ."
"So they issued an edict , in effect , that prevents women from being priests , pastors , deacons in the church , or chaplains in the military , and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary , they cannot teach if a boy is in the room , because you can find verses in the Bible , there &apos;s over 30,000 verses in the Bible , that say that a woman shouldn &apos;t teach a man , and so forth ."
But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position .
"That is an all-pervasive problem , because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer , for instance , wants to cheat women , they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God , why should I treat them as equals myself ?"
"The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence , and that is increasing tremendously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for instance , we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people , mostly black people and minorities , by putting them in prison ."
"When I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison ."
"Nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison ."
That &apos;s a sevenfold increase .
And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty .
"We &apos;re in California now , and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting 13 people for the death penalty ."
"If you add that up , that &apos;s 307 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed ."
"Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty , because it costs so much . ( Applause ) So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women ."
"Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most , and I &apos;ll be fairly brief , because I have a limited amount of time , as you know ."
One is genital mutilation .
"Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very soon in her life , her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and , in a non-sterilized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman &apos;s genitalia ."
"And sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate ."
"And then later , when she gets married , the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex ."
"This is not a rare thing , although it &apos;s against the law in most countries ."
"In Egypt , for instance , 91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity ."
This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries .
"Another very serious thing is honor killings , where a family with misinterpretation , again , of a holy scripture — there &apos;s nothing in the Quran that mandates this — will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve , or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing ."
"And this is done by members of her own family , so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family ."
"An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father , the uncle or the brother , but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women ."
"Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery , or human trafficking it &apos;s called nowadays ."
There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century .
There are 30 million people now living in slavery .
"The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year , and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery , and that 80 percent of those sold are women , into sexual slavery ."
"In the United States right this moment , 60,000 people are living in human bondage , or slavery ."
"Atlanta , Georgia , where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into slavery every month ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
"If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin , they can do it for 1,000 dollars ."
"A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that , and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $ 35,000 per slave ."
"The sex trade in Atlanta , Georgia , exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta , Georgia ."
"So this is another very serious problem , and the basic problem is prostitution , because there &apos;s not a whorehouse in America that &apos;s not known by the local officials , the local policemen , or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth ."
"And this leads to one of the worst problems , and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world ."
Sweden has got a good approach to it .
"About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery , but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted , and — ( Applause ) — prostitution has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the opposite position ."
"For every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America ."
"Canada , Ireland , I &apos;ve already said Sweden , France , and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire : our military and our great university system .
"In the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place ."
"The last report I got , there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military — 26,000 ."
"Only 3,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually prosecuted , and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization — a ship like my submarine , or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines — the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command , sexual assaults are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That law needs to be changed .
"The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists , because outside of the university system , if they rape somebody , they &apos;ll be prosecuted , but when they get on a university campus , they can rape with impunity ."
They &apos;re not prosecuted .
Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"Another thing that &apos;s very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes misinterpreted , but for full-time employment , a woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man ."
"When I became president , the difference was 39 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some progress , partially because I was president and so forth — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the Fortune 500 companies , 23 of them have women CEOs , out of 500 , and those CEOs , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other CEOs ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War .
"Sometimes , we &apos;ve had soldiers on the ground fighting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been flying overhead dropping bombs on people ."
"Other times , of course , now , we have drones that attack people and so forth ."
"But anyway , those kinds of things , the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes , are the basic causes , of abuse of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more basic cause that I need not mention , and that is that in general , men don &apos;t give a damn ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy , and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child , when separate but equal had existed ."
"Racial discrimination , legally , had existed for 100 years , from 1865 at the end of the War Between the States , the Civil War , all the way up to the 1960s , when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights ."
"But during that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that racial discrimination was okay , but they stayed quiet , because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs , unique access to jury duty , better schools , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that exists today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against discrimination against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they enjoy a privileged position ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system , the majority of men that control the military system , the majority of men that control the governments of the world , and the majority of men that control the great religions ."
So what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in Egypt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth .
I didn &apos;t even go down to detail about that .
"I have 12 grandchildren , four children , and 10 great-grandchildren , and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America , not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country , in having equal rights , and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak ."
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
The acid rain was falling on the forests .
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
"The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off ."
"None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled ."
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
Per-capita food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
"How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
"The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
These are both real objects .
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
"I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
"They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting ."
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
"The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations ."
"Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days ."
"There was no progress , no innovation ."
"It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true ."
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance ."
"The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors ."
They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?"
"Well , it uses sexual reproduction ."
"In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes extinct for the other to survive .
"But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages ."
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
"And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a unique human feature .
No other animal does it .
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
"As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange ."
"You can have , as it were , asexual culture ."
"Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture ."
They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
"In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks ."
"But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas ."
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange raise living standards ?
"Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 ."
"And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries ."
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and axes .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears ."
So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on ."
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
"That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs ."
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
"If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside ."
You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
"You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc ."
How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service ."
"And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage ."
"Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour ."
"In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 ."
"Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself ."
It was self-sufficiency .
We call that poverty these days .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc ."
"They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
"In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever ."
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
"But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too ."
"They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
"That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction ."
The queen does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction ."
"( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen ."
( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor ."
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
"In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females ."
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
"The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a highly cooperative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
"Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today ."
They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford ."
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials ."
"For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools ."
They &apos;re always made from local chert .
"In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away ."
"And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups ."
Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
"And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia ."
You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
And that will have led to specialization .
How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
"Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe ."
"They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia ."
"So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration ."
"What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse ."
An example is Tasmania .
"When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress ."
"They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
"How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people ."
"The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years ."
The Tasmanians were isolated .
"Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
"Nobody , literally nobody ."
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
"The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on ."
"We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole ."
"I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities ."
We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups ."
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
"What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit ."
"However , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things ."
There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
"Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance ."
"Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation ."
Thank you .

"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
of sleep-deprived women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep ."
"Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion ."
"I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye ."
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
"And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue ."
"We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol ."
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship ."
"Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions ."
So a high I.Q.
"does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
"In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
"Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space ."
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
"And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain ."
"One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability ."
"What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function ."
"So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
"If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain ."
"And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces ."
"You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself ."
OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
"But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists ."
"This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother ."
This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Freudian view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother ."
"Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this argument ."
"It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Freudian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
"Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain ."
"Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces ."
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I talked about that earlier .
"Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?"
"But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
"Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?"
Which you can completely ignore .
"So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system ."
Your heart starts beating faster .
You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
"And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating ."
"So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
"So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?"
"And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system ."
"But maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident ."
"So because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?"
"( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?"
You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
"Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat ."
"There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut ."
"So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor ."
"It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain ."
"By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone ."
"Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident ."
"So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem ."
"When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor ."
"OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?"
"Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?"
And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
And you all know what a phantom limb is .
"When an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg ."
"In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body ."
"Believe it or not , even with internal viscera ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month ."
"And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that ."
"OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom ."
"It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye ."
"These are very compelling , vivid sensations ."
The patient &apos;s not delusional .
"He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient ."
"But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed ."
It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?"
It sounds like an oxymoron .
"But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury ."
"The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident ."
"So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?"
And this is a serious clinical problem .
Patients become depressed .
"Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?"
"So , how do you treat this syndrome ?"
"Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?"
"When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No ."
"And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?"
"The brain learns , because of this Hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"How do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?"
"Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp ."
"How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality ."
But that costs millions of dollars .
"So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies ."
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
"You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in ."
He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
"He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated ."
"He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?"
"And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started giggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real ."
"He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !"
And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes ."
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;"
"&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a kid in a candy store ."
"So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two ."
"Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
"On the other hand , there &apos;s no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?"
"And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?"
It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
"And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the bonus ."
"Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation ."
"Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors ."
"This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients ."
"OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia ."
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
"He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored ."
"Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ?"
"Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects ."
"Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color ."
"C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses ."
"In us , all the senses are distinct ."
These people muddle up their senses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
"Synesthesia runs in families , so Galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis ."
"Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answered before .
"OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?"
"Well , there are many theories ."
One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it ."
"Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego ."
"( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?"
"So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
Remember I said it runs in families ?
That gives you the clue .
"And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else ."
"So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia ."
"If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?"
"Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?"
"I mean , schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"Normal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun ."
"Instantly , you &apos;ve found the links ."
"Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia ."
"And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists ."
"OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia ."
The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
"( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetes , but you &apos;re in denial about it ."
"Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C."
"Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?"
"Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet ."
"One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba ."
Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands ."
Ninety-nine percent of you .
"Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator ."
"It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glitters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold ."
"You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning ."
"So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates ."
"Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity ."
"All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry about that .

I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
"If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another ."
Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
"Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like ."
I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
"And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful ."
"My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place ."
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
"And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?"
And I felt lighter in my body .
