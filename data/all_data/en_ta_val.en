The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
"But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire ."
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
"So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials ."
These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
"In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban ."
"And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design ."
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
"Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications ."
"At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary ."
So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
"We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great ."
"This is our group , our main group of weavers ."
They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
They all have bank accounts .
They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
"And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers ."
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .

"In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?"
"If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean ."
"Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks ."
Here &apos;s my clock .
"It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height ."
"Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day ."
"So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base ."
"At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock ."
"Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower ."
"So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant ."
"However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock ."
It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
"In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath ."
"This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment ."
Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
You can see why I hate Chris .
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
"All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good ."
"Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses ."
"And when she said this , I had an epiphany ."
So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
"To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph ."
"Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses ."
"Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary ."
Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
"Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer ."
( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant noodles .
"Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three ."
"You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people ."
"OK , next , clubbing ."
These people I still do hang out with .
"All right , and smoking ."
"Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers ."
"OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?"
"It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one ."
"That is , of course , sex . Great sex ."
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth ."
And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
"You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch ."
Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution ."
And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
"You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses ."
Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?"
"Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look ."
"Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
"Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs ."
"Oh , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free candy .
You guys ready ?
All right .

"You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants ."
"Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago ."
"And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives ."
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initiation rites .
"We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture ."
"And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world ."
"All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope ."
"Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere ."
"And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness ."
The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
"And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate ."
"No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity ."
"And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss ."
"When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules ."
A language is a flash of the human spirit .
It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
"Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities ."
"And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead ."
"What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?"
"And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese ."
Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes ."
"Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend ."
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
"And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language ."
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
"Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 ."
"In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake ."
"They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives ."
"They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death ."
But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
They speared each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
"We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing ."
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies ."
"In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult ."
"On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?"
"Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever ."
"There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era ."
"But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead ."
"So , the living give birth to the spirits ."
"The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god ."
That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
"We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?"
"So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation ."
"Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia ."
"Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain ."
"In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish ."
"To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary ."
"The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance ."
"And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you ."
"It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world ."
"Now , this level of intuition becomes very important ."
"Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation ."
"Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here ."
It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
"This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire ."
"What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis ."
"This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine ."
"If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine ."
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
"In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes — who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase ."
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
"Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question ."
"How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?"
"Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless ."
"But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?"
"This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species ."
"And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants ."
"I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key ."
"Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on ."
"Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change ."
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
"It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination ."
"Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away"
"to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold ."
"Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination ."
"You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy ."
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
"I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution ."
This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
"One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor ."
"The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold ."
"And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?"
"Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities ."
"And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years ."
"The Neolithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago ."
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
"Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia ."
"When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices ."
"And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism ."
"This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather ."
"The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements ."
This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
"The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools ."
"Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it ."
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
"So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing ."
"He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade ."
"He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it ."
"He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt ."
"Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world ."
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
"And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all ."
They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
"They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope ."
"So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything ."
"We think that polemics — ( Applause ) — we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month ."
156 nations carry our television channel .
Our magazines are read by millions .
"And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being ."
Thank you very much .

"So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s ."
"When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid ."
"But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them ."
"After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job ."
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
That is me playing my imaginary piano .
"An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school ."
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
"Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained ."
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so unfair .
So I was determined to find another calling .
Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
I turned to books .
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
"&#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?"
"Books banned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
"The Bible is interesting , but strange ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
"&quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents ."
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
It offers many insights .
"For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with ."
"It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world ."
A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
"So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?"
So I started reading books in pairs .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences ."
"&#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations ."
"For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual ."
"For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting ."
"So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages ."
"&#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain ."
"For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !"
&quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
"Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from ."
Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
"So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time ."
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
This back here was my brain cancer .
Isn &apos;t it nice ?
"( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; phew ."
"( Applause ) Having brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , shocking news for me ."
I knew nothing about cancer .
"In Western cultures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you disappear in a way ."
"Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exams , your lab values , a list of medicines ."
And everyone changes as well .
You suddenly become a disease on legs .
Doctors start speaking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
"People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doctor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; And in the meanwhile , you &apos;re left with questions to which nobody gives an answer ."
These are the &quot; &quot; Can I ? &quot; &quot; questions : Can I work while I have cancer ?
Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
"And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?"
"Are there any other options ? &quot; &quot; And , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios , because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you ."
"But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who waits . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Things are changing , but classically , they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition , to get your friends and family engaged , or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going through ."
"But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers ."
"While I was in the hospital , I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it ."
"It was really hard to obtain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I talked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A cure , whichever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital against medical advice ."
I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery .
"I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice ."
"So my best bet was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone ."
"So I created a website , which is called La Cura , on which I put my medical data , online ."
I actually had to hack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
"( Laughter ) I chose this word , La Cura — La Cura in Italian means &quot; &quot; the cure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our Western cultures , it means eradicating or reversing a disease , but in different cultures , for example , a culture from Asia , from the Mediterranean , from Latin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"Of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians ."
"I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure ."
"And , it worked ."
The La Cura website went viral .
"I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts — emails , social networking — most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer , but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual ."
"For example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for La Cura ."
"For example , here we see Francesca Fini in her performance ."
"Or , as artist Patrick Lichty has done : He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse ."
"Now you can have my cancer , too !"
"( Laughter ) Which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer ."
"And this was going on — scientists , the traditional medicine experts , several researchers , doctors — all connected with me to give advice ."
"With all this information and support , I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , oncologists , and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving , which is very important ."
"And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures ."
"And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me ."
"&#91; Surgery &#93; The follow-up MRIs showed , luckily , little to no growth of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and choose .
"I chose the doctor I wanted to work with , I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in , and in the meanwhile , I was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt pity for me ."
"Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of La Cura ."
What are the outcomes ?
"I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine ."
"( Applause ) I had excellent news after the surgery — I have — I had a very low-grade glioma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot ."
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged .
"Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery , which was very intense , a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls ."
"And right before the operation , we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor , to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid ."
"Obviously , there were ."
&#91; Open &#93; And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura .
"Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences ."
Doctors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usually consult when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-founding , continuous state of translation among many different languages , in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research ."
&#91; Society &#93; The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components .
This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cure for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
Thank you .
"Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania ."
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"On the stage that day , I was so nervous ."
"My English lost , I wanted to vomit ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"All sisters , excepting me ."
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
"Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers ."
"Like everyone else , we grew maize ."
One year our fortune turned very bad .
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
"My family ate one meal per day , at night ."
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
The food passes through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
"In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees ."
"Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education ."
So I went to a library .
"I read books , science books , especially physics ."
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
"Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials ."
"Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes ."
"Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell ."
Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
"( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an airplane before .
I had never slept in a hotel .
"So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams ."
God bless .
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , trust yourself and believe ."
"Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .

"So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street ."
"This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names ."
"Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed ."
"So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names ."
Blocks have names .
"Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ."
"All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight ."
"There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy ."
"So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four ."
"But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this map is also accurate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true ."
"So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true ."
Domo arigato gozaimashita .
