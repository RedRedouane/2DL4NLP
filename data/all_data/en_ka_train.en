"We live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first victims of difficult economic times , I think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration ."
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do .
"But I think to set the scene , I want to show — the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a mess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the Guardian newspaper ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration , I should tell you how much it costs ."
So this is a game called &quot; &quot; spot the science budgets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.K. government spend .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 620 billion a year ."
"The science budget is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs ."
And it &apos;s one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob .
It &apos;s about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion .
That funds everything in the U.K.
"from medical research , space exploration , where I work , at CERN in Geneva , particle physics , engineering , even arts and humanities , funded from the science budget , which is that 3.3 billion , that little , tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
"That percentage , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France ."
"R &amp; D in total in the economy , publicly funded , is about 0.6 percent of GDP ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is straight from &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System , &quot; &quot; is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was sent back by the Cassini space probe around Saturn , after we &apos;d finished filming &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the series ."
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
"So that big sweeping , white sphere in the corner is Saturn , which is actually in the background of the picture ."
"And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus , which is about as big as the British Isles ."
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
"So , tiny moon ."
What &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
"this an unprocessed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , straight from Saturnian orbit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb ."
This is how we visualize that in &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon .
"That &apos;s fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wherever we find liquid water , we find life ."
"So , to find strong evidence of liquid , pools of liquid , beneath the surface of a moon 750 million miles away from the Earth is really quite astounding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essentially , is maybe that &apos;s a habitat for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a graphic . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of Enceladus .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
"So it made a very low pass , just a few hundred kilometers above the surface ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space , absolutely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of Jupiter , Europa ."
"And again , we had to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that this moon , as most moons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock ."
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the surface of the moon Europa , which is a thick sheet of ice , probably a hundred kilometers thick ."
"But by measuring the way that Europa interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter , and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around , we &apos;ve inferred very strongly that there &apos;s an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa ."
"So below the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon ."
"It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s saltwater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined ."
"So that place , a little moon around Jupiter , is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; Are we alone in the universe ? &quot; &quot; Is there any other use to exploration and science , other than just a sense of wonder ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very famous picture taken , actually , on my first Christmas Eve , December 24th , 1968 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by Apollo 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Earthrise from Apollo 8 .
"A famous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that saved 1968 , which was a turbulent year — the student riots in Paris , the height of the Vietnam War ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and Al Gore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at TED , is that this picture , arguably , was the beginning of the environmental movement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a solid , immovable , kind of indestructible place , but as a very small , fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not often said about the space exploration , about the Apollo program , is the economic contribution it made ."
"I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness , the economic impact of Apollo ."
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics .
"And it showed that for every $ 1 spent on Apollo , 14 came back into the U.S. economy ."
"So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , I think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over ."
So exploration can pay for itself .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen ."
"See , back in the 1880s , 1890s , many scientists , many observers , looked at the light given off from atoms ."
And they saw strange pictures like this .
"What you &apos;re seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn &apos;t just glow like a white light , it just emits light at particular colors , a red one , a light blue one , some dark blue ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that &apos;s explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them .
And the electrons can only be in particular places .
"And when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they emit light at particular colors ."
"And so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only emit light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
"And now , this is a picture of atoms in the Sun &apos;s atmosphere absorbing light ."
"And again , they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down , jump up and fall down ."
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
And that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; helios &quot; &quot; — helios from the Sun .
"Now , that sounds esoteric , and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon , for example ."
"The way that silicon behaves , the fact that you can build transistors , is a purely quantum phenomenon ."
"So without that curiosity-driven understanding of the structure of atoms , which led to this rather esoteric theory , quantum mechanics , then we wouldn &apos;t have transistors , we wouldn &apos;t have silicon chips , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the basis of our modern economy ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful twist to that tale ."
"In &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System , &quot; &quot; we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can transport it , not only to the planets , but to the most distant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms — the same theory that describes transistors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the Sun ."
That &apos;s a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a telescope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun ."
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mass ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; &quot; our garden &quot; &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it ."
It &apos;s just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the galactic core , which is why it &apos;s shining out so brightly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our neighboring galaxies ."
But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it ."
That &apos;s a Type Ia supernova explosion .
"Now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there ."
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
"It sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the Sun ."
"And it has a binary companion that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas ."
"And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit , and then it explodes ."
"And it explodes , and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks , and releases , not only energy , but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf ."
"Now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang ."
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quote that I found — we &apos;re talking about serendipity there — from Alexander Fleming : &quot; &quot; When I woke up just after dawn on September 28 , 1928 , I certainly didn &apos;t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world &apos;s first antibiotic . &quot; &quot; Now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor ."
"And they certainly didn &apos;t intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — serendipity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can reveal quite astonishing things .
"It can also , I think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet ."
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the Cassini space probe .
"But it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings ."
"And if I blow it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn .
That &apos;s our planet from 750 million miles away .
"I think the Earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the Voyager spacecraft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for scale .
The Voyager is a tiny machine .
"It &apos;s currently 10 billion miles away from Earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we &apos;re still in contact with it ."
"But it visited Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune ."
"And after it visited all four of those planets , Carl Sagan , who &apos;s one of my great heroes , had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; Pale Blue Dot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what Sagan wrote about it , just to finish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Consider again that dot ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"On it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives ."
"The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam ."
It &apos;s been said that astronomy &apos;s a humbling and character-building experience .
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world .
"To me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration ."
"The argument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 1920s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had penicillin .
You could have made it in the 1890s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the transistor .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"Surely , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to discover anything else about our universe .
"Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s rapidly becoming a hero of mine , Humphrey Davy , who did his science at the turn of the 19th century ."
He was clearly under assault all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
"Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate , that our triumphs are complete , that there are no mysteries in nature , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
You might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...
"And it does , doesn &apos;t it ?"
I was clapping . They were clapping .
"Thank you , thank you ."
"We &apos;re going to share a lot of secrets today , you and I , and in doing so , I hope that we can lift some of the shame many of us feel about sex ."
How many here have ever been catcalled by a stranger ?
Lots of women .
"For me , the time I remember best is when that stranger was a student of mine ."
"He came up to me after class that night and his words confirmed what I already knew : &quot; &quot; I am so sorry , professor ."
"If I had known it was you , I would never have said those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I wasn &apos;t a person to him until I was his professor ."
"This concept , called objectification , is the foundation of sexism , and we see it reinforced through every aspect of our lives ."
We see it in the government that refuses to punish men for raping women .
We see it in advertisements .
How many of you have seen an advertisement that uses a woman &apos;s breast to sell an entirely unrelated product ?
Or movie after movie after movie that portrays women as only love interests ?
Media plays a large role in perpetuating the objectification of women .
Let &apos;s consider the classic romantic comedy .
"We &apos;re typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies , two kinds of desirable women , anyway ."
The first is the sexy bombshell .
This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body .
The first is the slut .
She is to be consumed and forgotten .
She is much too available .
Marriage material .
"We &apos;re actually told that women have two roles , but these two roles have a difficult time existing within the same woman ."
"On the rare occasion that I share with a new acquaintance that I study sex , if they don &apos;t end the conversation right then , they &apos;re usually pretty intrigued ."
&quot; Oh . Tell me more . &quot;
So I do .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Oh . Huh .
Do pregnant people even have sex ?
"I asked this question in a survey of over 500 adults , and most responded with &quot; &quot; belly &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; round &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; cute . &quot; &quot; This didn &apos;t surprise me too much ."
What else do we label as cute ?
Babies . Puppies . Kittens .
The elderly . Right ?
"( Laughter ) When we label an adult as cute , though , we take away a lot of their intelligence , their complexity ."
We reduce them to childlike qualities .
Most of the responses were negative .
&quot; Gross . &quot;
&quot; Awkward . &quot;
&quot; Not sexy . &quot; &quot; Odd . &quot;
&quot; Uncomfortable . &quot;
&quot; How ? &quot;
That last one really stuck with me .
"We might think that because we divorce pregnant women and moms from sexuality , we are removing the constraints of sexual objectification ."
Not exactly .
What happens instead is a different kind of objectification .
"In my efforts to explain this to others , one conversation led to the Venus of Willendorf , a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed was a goddess of love and beauty , hence the name Venus ."
They also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed lying down because her tiny feet don &apos;t allow her to be freestanding .
She also had no face .
"For this reason , it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility and not a portrait of a person ."
She was an object .
"In the history of her interpretation , she went from object of ideal beauty and love to object of reproduction ."
"When a woman becomes pregnant , she leaves the realm of men &apos;s sexual desire and slides into her reproductive and child-rearing role ."
"I &apos;ve taken to calling this the Willendorf effect , and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life ."
Has anyone here ever been visibly pregnant ?
Or asked private questions about your birth plan ?
And then told why those choices are all wrong ?
"Yeah , me too ."
Or had a server refuse to bring you a glass of wine ?
"This one might give you pause , I know , but stay with me ."
This is a huge secret .
It is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy .
Many of us don &apos;t know this because doctors don &apos;t trust pregnant women with this secret — ( Laughter ) especially if she &apos;s less educated or a woman of color .
"What this tells us is , this Willendorf effect , it &apos;s also classist and racist ."
When we tell women that sexual pleasure — excuse me .
"When we tell women that sex isn &apos;t worth the risk during pregnancy , what we &apos;re telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn &apos;t matter ."
"So what we are telling her is that she in fact doesn &apos;t matter , even though the needs of her fetus are not at odds with her own needs ."
"So medical providers , such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have the opportunity to educate about the safety of sex during pregnancy ."
"( Applause ) Pregnant women are not faceless , identity-less vessels of reproduction who can &apos;t stand on their own two feet ."
"But the truth is , the real secret is , we tell all women that their sexual pleasure doesn &apos;t matter ."
She is revolutionary .
"That is a woman who insists that you make room for her at the table of power , and that is the most terrifying of all because we can &apos;t make room for her without some of us giving up the extra space we hold ."
I am the mother of two boys and we could use your help .
"Even though my boys hear me say regularly that it &apos;s important for men to recognize women as equals and they see their father modeling this , we need what happens in the world to reinforce what happens in our home ."
This is not a men &apos;s problem or a women &apos;s problem .
"This is everyone &apos;s problem , and we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality ."
"If you don &apos;t know her , don &apos;t even ask to touch her belly ."
You wouldn &apos;t anybody else .
Don &apos;t tell her what she can and cannot eat .
"If you &apos;re somebody who has sex with women , prioritize her pleasure ."
"If you have children — ( Laughter ) have conversations about sex as early as possible , because kids don &apos;t look up s-e-x in the dictionary anymore ."
They look it up on the internet .
Admit it .
"And regardless of whether you have children or not , support comprehensive sex education that doesn &apos;t shame our teenagers ."
"Every single day , we are all given the opportunity to disrupt patterns of inequality ."
I think we can all agree that it &apos;s worth the trouble to do so .
Thank you .
( Applause )
It &apos;s about time . End sequence . Take one .
15 seconds studio .
"10 , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two ..."
Philip Zimbardo : Let &apos;s tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam &apos;s temptation .
"&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , guys ."
I don &apos;t want to get in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay . One bite . What the hell ? &quot;
And most of them did so without using birth control .
So much for promises .
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation .
"They cannot wait . The others , of course , wait ."
That &apos;s enormous . That &apos;s like a whole set of different IQ points .
"Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters ."
"Ever since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language ."
"But to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China ."
"Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so ."
"I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful ."
"Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence ."
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
"Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way ."
"A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters ."
"You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy ."
"The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature — enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers ."
Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
Person .
"If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; &quot; — This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but I like to think that way . Whichever works for you ."
This is a tree .
Tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radicals .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
"If someone walks behind , that is &quot; &quot; to follow . &quot; &quot; As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd ."
"If a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped ."
"He &apos;s a prisoner , just like Jonah inside the whale ."
"One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods ."
"Three trees together , we create the forest ."
"Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation ."
"Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; idiot . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic ."
Remember fire ?
"Two fires together , I get really hot ."
"Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames ."
"Set the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning ."
"For us , the sun is the source of prosperity ."
"Two suns together , prosperous ."
"Three together , that &apos;s sparkles ."
"Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s brightness ."
"It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night ."
The sun is coming up above the horizon . Sunrise .
"A door . Put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt ."
"Put a mouth inside the door , asking questions ."
Knock knock . Is anyone home ?
"This person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading ."
"On the left , we have a woman ."
"Two women together , they have an argument ."
"( Laughter ) Three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery ."
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
"By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 ."
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
"So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old ."
"So after we know the characters , we start building phrases ."
"For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a volcano ."
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .
"This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China ."
"So a sun , origin together , we build Japan ."
"A person behind Japan , what do we get ?"
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
"In ancient China , that means in exile , because Chinese emperors , they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains ."
"Nowadays , exile has turned into getting out ."
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .
( Applause )
We had no idea what was causing this disease .
And it was a highly romanticized disease .
And some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred creative genius .
"They were more social , more energetic ."
"So accidental discovery is not uncommon in science , but it requires more than just a happy accident ."
You have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur .
"Thankfully , since the 1950s , we &apos;ve developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis ."
"And at least in the United States , though not necessarily in other countries , we have closed our sanitoriums and probably most of you are not too worried about TB ."
"We are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder , or PTSD ."
"And also , like tuberculosis in the 1950s , we don &apos;t know what causes it ."
And this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging .
"When doctors first saw this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid , they didn &apos;t really recognize what they saw ."
"So they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme TB and in patients that were highly emotionally stable , which is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant ."
"They were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease , they could not see the larger implications for another disease ."
"And to be fair , it &apos;s not entirely their fault ."
Functional fixedness is a bias that affects all of us .
But it does make you wonder what else we &apos;ve missed .
"That includes liver toxicity , weight gain of over 50 pounds , suicidality ."
"And that was 30 years ago , and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs ."
"And in science , we try and remove our bias , right , by running double-blinded experiments or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be ."
But bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study and how we choose to study it .
"So we &apos;ve focused on serotonin now for the past 30 years , often to the exclusion of other things ."
"We still have no cures , and what if serotonin isn &apos;t all there is to depression ?"
What if it &apos;s not even the key part of it ?
"It works on glutamate , which is another neurotransmitter ."
And it &apos;s also repurposed .
It was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery .
There was no mania to signal its effects .
So we could have stopped there .
And it looked kind of like this .
"So if you look at the far left , if you put a mouse in a new space , this is the box , it &apos;s very exciting , a mouse will walk around and explore , and you can see that pink line is actually the measure of them walking ."
And we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup that it can decide to interact with .
It will be social .
"Yet the mice that had gotten that one injection of Calypsol , here on your right , they were exploring , they were social ."
"They looked like they had never been stressed at all , which is impossible ."
"And I remember us yelling , which you &apos;re not supposed to do in an animal room where you &apos;re testing , because it had worked ."
"It seemed like these mice were protected against stress , or they were inappropriately happy , however you want to call it ."
And we were really excited .
So we ran it again .
"And every time someone ran it , they confirmed the same thing ."
It seemed like this one injection of Calypsol was somehow protecting against stress for weeks .
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property .
It &apos;s the absence of susceptibility factors and risk factors for these disorders .
But what if it were active ?
"Maybe we could enhance it , sort of akin to putting on armor ."
We had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug .
"And like I said , we only gave a tiny amount of the drug , and it lasted for weeks , and that &apos;s not like anything you see with antidepressants ."
But it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines .
"So in immune vaccines , you &apos;ll get your shots , and then weeks , months , years later , when you &apos;re actually exposed to bacteria , it &apos;s not the vaccine in your body that protects you ."
"Or similar to as I said before , with this palliative , you &apos;ll take something that will suppress the symptoms , but it won &apos;t treat the underlying infection , and you &apos;ll only feel better during the time in which you &apos;re taking it , which is why you have to keep taking it ."
And in depression and PTSD — here we have your stress exposure — we only have palliative care .
"Antidepressants only suppress symptoms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the length of your own life ."
"So that &apos;s first responders and firefighters , refugees , prisoners and prison guards , soldiers , you name it ."
"And to give you a sense of the scale of these diseases , in 2010 , the global burden of disease was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars , and since they are chronic , that cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise up to six trillion dollars in just the next 15 years ."
It &apos;s used in children . We use it on the battlefield .
"If we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first , it &apos;d be pretty easy for us to develop it , but as is , we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere ."
And that will be years .
We could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time .
"But actually , beyond functional fixedness and mental set , there &apos;s a real other challenge to repurposing drugs , which is policy ."
"Regardless , the idea itself is completely novel in psychiatry , to use drugs to prevent mental illness as opposed to just treat it ."
"It is possible that 20 , 50 , 100 years from now , we will look back now at depression and PTSD the way we look back at tuberculosis sanitoriums as a thing of the past ."
This could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic .
"But as a great scientist once said , &quot; &quot; Only a fool is sure of anything ."
"A wise man keeps on guessing . &quot; &quot; Thank you , guys ."
( Applause )
"It goes without saying that it &apos;s really difficult for me to be here today , but my brother Deah , his wife Yusor , and her sister Razan don &apos;t give me much of a choice ."
"I &apos;m hopeful that by the end of this talk you will make a choice , and join me in standing up against hate ."
"It &apos;s December 27 , 2014 : the morning of my brother &apos;s wedding day ."
"A 23-year-old , six-foot-three basketball , particularly Steph Curry , fanatic — ( Laughter ) An American kid in dental school ready to take on the world ."
"When Deah and Yusor have their first dance , I see the love in his eyes , her reciprocated joy , and my emotions begin to overwhelm me ."
I move to the back of the hall and burst into tears .
"And the second the song finishes playing , he beelines towards me , buries me into his arms and rocks me back and forth ."
"Even in that moment , when everything was so distracting , he was attuned to me ."
"He cups my face and says , &quot; &quot; Suzanne , I am who I am because of you ."
Thank you for everything .
"I love you . &quot; &quot; About a month later , I &apos;m back home in North Carolina for a short visit , and on the last evening , I run upstairs to Deah &apos;s room , eager to find out how he &apos;s feeling being a newly married man ."
"With a big boyish smile he says , &quot; I &apos;m so happy . I love her . She &apos;s an amazing girl . &quot;"
And she is .
"At just 21 , she &apos;d recently been accepted to join Deah at UNC dental school ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;ll never forget that moment sitting there with him — how free he was in his happiness .
"My littler brother , a basketball-obsessed kid , had become and transformed into an accomplished young man ."
That is who they were .
"Standing there that night , I take a deep breath and look at Deah and tell him , &quot; I have never been more proud of you than I am in this moment . &quot;"
"He pulls me into his tall frame , hugs me goodnight , and I leave the next morning without waking him to go back to San Francisco ."
That is the last time I ever hug him .
"Ten days later , I &apos;m on call at San Francisco General Hospital when I receive a barrage of vague text messages expressing condolences ."
"Confused , I call my father , who calmly intones , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s been a shooting in Deah &apos;s neighborhood in Chapel Hill ."
"I fling out of my chair and faint onto the gritty hospital floor , wailing ."
"I take the first red-eye out of San Francisco , numb and disoriented ."
"I walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents &apos; arms , sobbing ."
"I then run up to Deah &apos;s room as I did so many times before , just looking for him , only to find a void that will never be filled ."
Investigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed the sequence of events .
"Deah had just gotten off the bus from class , Razan was visiting for dinner , already at home with Yusor ."
"As they began to eat , they heard a knock on the door ."
"When Deah opened it , their neighbor proceeded to fire multiple shots at him ."
"According to 911 calls , the girls were heard screaming ."
"The man turned towards the kitchen and fired a single shot into Yusor &apos;s hip , immobilizing her ."
"On his way out , he shot Deah one last time — a bullet in the mouth — for a total of eight bullets : two lodged in the head , two in his chest and the rest in his extremities ."
"Deah , Yusor and Razan were executed in a place that was meant to be safe : their home ."
"For months , this man had been harassing them : knocking on their door , brandishing his gun on a couple of occasions ."
His Facebook was cluttered with anti-religion posts .
Yusor felt particularly threatened by him .
"As she was moving in , he told Yusor and her mom that he didn &apos;t like the way they looked ."
"In response , Yusor &apos;s mom told her to be kind to her neighbor , that as he got to know them , he &apos;d see them for who they were ."
I guess we &apos;ve all become so numb to the hatred that we couldn &apos;t have ever imagined it turning into fatal violence .
"The man who murdered my brother turned himself in to the police shortly after the murders , saying he killed three kids , execution-style , over a parking dispute ."
"The police issued a premature public statement that morning , echoing his claims without bothering to question it or further investigate ."
It turns out there was no parking dispute .
There was no argument .
No violation .
"I sit on my brother &apos;s bed and remember his words , the words he gave me so freely and with so much love , &quot; I am who I am because of you . &quot;"
That &apos;s what it takes for me to climb through my crippling grief and speak out .
I cannot let my family &apos;s deaths be diminished to a segment that is barely discussed on local news .
"They were murdered by their neighbor because of their faith , because of a piece of cloth they chose to don on their heads , because they were visibly Muslim ."
A terrorist attack .
"When white men commit acts of violence in the US , they &apos;re lone wolves , mentally ill or driven by a parking dispute ."
"I know that I have to give my family voice , and I do the only thing I know how : I send a Facebook message to everyone I know in media ."
"A couple of hours later , in the midst of a chaotic house overflowing with friends and family , our neighbor Neal comes over , sits down next to my parents and asks , &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; &quot; Neal had over two decades of experience in journalism , but he makes it clear that he &apos;s not there in his capacity as journalist , but as a neighbor who wants to help ."
Even now I don &apos;t have the words to thank him .
"&quot; &quot; Just tell me when , and I &apos;ll have all the news channels present , &quot; &quot; he said ."
He did for us what we could not do for ourselves in a moment of devastation .
"I delivered the press statement , still wearing scrubs from the previous night ."
"The following day , major newspapers — including the New York Times , Chicago Tribune — published stories about Deah , Yusor and Razan , allowing us to reclaim the narrative and call attention the mainstreaming of anti-Muslim hatred ."
"These days , it feels like Islamophobia is a socially acceptable form of bigotry ."
We just have to put up with it and smile .
"The nasty stares , the palpable fear when boarding a plane , the random pat downs at airports that happen 99 percent of the time ."
It doesn &apos;t stop there .
We have politicians reaping political and financial gains off our backs .
"Just a couple months ago , Khalid Jabara , a Lebanese-American Christian , was murdered in Oklahoma by his neighbor — a man who called him a &quot; &quot; filthy Arab . &quot; &quot; This man was previously jailed for a mere 8 months , after attempting run over Khalid &apos;s mother with his car ."
"Chances are you haven &apos;t heard Khalid &apos;s story , because it didn &apos;t make it to national news ."
The least we can do is call it what it is : a hate crime .
I was disheartened .
Humiliated .
"Days later rounding on the same patient , she looks at me and says , &quot; Your people are killing people in Los Angeles . &quot;"
I look around expectantly .
Again : silence .
"I sit on her bed and gently ask her , &quot; &quot; Have I ever done anything but treat you with respect and kindness ?"
"Odds are you may have experienced it , whether for your race , gender , sexuality or religious beliefs ."
We &apos;ve all been in situations where we &apos;ve witnessed something wrong and didn &apos;t speak up .
Maybe we weren &apos;t equipped with the tools to respond in the moment .
Maybe we weren &apos;t even aware of our own implicit biases .
"We can all agree that bigotry is unacceptable , but when we see it , we &apos;re silent , because it makes us uncomfortable ."
But stepping right into that discomfort means you are also stepping into the ally zone .
There may be over three million Muslims in America .
That &apos;s still just one percent of the total population .
"Martin Luther King once said , &quot; &quot; In the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends . &quot; &quot; So what made my neighbor Neal &apos;s allyship so profound ?"
A couple of things .
He stepped up to support a 15-year-old Muslim girl &apos;s mission to introduce a hijab emoji .
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s a simple gesture , but it has a significant subconscious impact on normalizing and humanizing Muslims , including the community as a part of an &quot; &quot; us &quot; &quot; instead of an &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; The editor in chief of Women &apos;s Running magazine just put the first hijabi to ever be on the cover of a US fitness magazine ."
What resources and expertise do you bring to the table ?
Will you be Neal ?
Many neighbors appeared in this story .
Let them know you stand with them in solidarity .
"Nothing will ever bring back Deah , Yusor and Razan ."
"But when we raise our collective voices , that is when we stop the hate ."
Thank you .

"Images like this , from the Auschwitz concentration camp , have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are , where we &apos;ve come from and the times we live in ."
"During the twentieth century , we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin , Hitler , Mao , Pol Pot , Rwanda and other genocides , and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq ."
"This has led to a common understanding of our situation , namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence , and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from , to our peril ."
"We teach it to our children . We hear it on television and in storybooks . Now , the original title of this session was , &quot; &quot; Everything You Know Is Wrong , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong , that , in fact , our ancestors were far more violent than we are , that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time , and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species &apos; existence ."
"It &apos;s especially evident in the West , beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment ."
"Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies ."
"The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man , as opposed to passing away of natural causes , in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest ."
"Also at the millennium scale , we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible . And in this supposed source of our moral values , one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare , such as the following from Numbers 31 : &quot; &quot; And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses , and they slew all the males . And Moses said unto them , &apos; Have you saved all the women alive ? Now , therefore , kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him , but all the women children that have not know a man"
"by lying with him keep alive for yourselves . &apos; &quot; &quot; In other words , kill the men ; kill the children ; if you see any virgins , then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them ."
You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk .
"Also in the Bible , one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality , adultery , blasphemy , idolatry , talking back to your parents — ( Laughter ) — and picking up sticks on the Sabbath ."
"Well , let &apos;s click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude , and look at the century scale ."
"Although we don &apos;t have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times , we know just from conventional history — the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence ."
"For example , any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment . The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine , in those days would result in your tongue being cut out , your ears being cut off , you being blinded , a hand being chopped off and so on ."
"There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment : burning at the stake , disemboweling , breaking on the wheel , being pulled apart by horses and so on ."
"What about one-on-one murder ? Well , there , there are good statistics , because many municipalities recorded the cause of death ."
"The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village , hamlet , town , county that he could find , and he supplemented them with national data , when nations started keeping statistics ."
Let &apos;s click down now to the decade scale .
"And , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is ."
"Even in the year scale , one can see a decline of violence ."
"Since the end of the Cold War , there have been fewer civil wars , fewer genocides — indeed , a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs — and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime ."
"This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics . You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the &apos; 50s and the &apos; 60s , then it soared upward for several decades , and began a precipitous decline , starting in the 1990s , so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960 ."
"President Clinton , if you &apos;re here , thank you ."
One of them is we have better reporting . The Associated Press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth-century monks were .
"There &apos;s a cognitive illusion . We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something , the higher the probability that you assign to it ."
"Maybe I had better shoot him , before he shoots me , especially since , even if he doesn &apos;t want to kill me , he &apos;s probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me . &quot; &quot; And so on ."
"Now , one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence ."
"You don &apos;t strike first , but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded ."
"Life becomes an episode of &quot; &quot; The Sopranos . &quot; &quot; Hobbes &apos; solution , the &quot; &quot; Leviathan , &quot; &quot; was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency — a leviathan — then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack , because any kind of aggression will be punished , leaving its profitability as zero . That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively , out of fear of them attacking you first ."
So that &apos;s a bit of a support for the leviathan theory .
"Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy , in failed states , collapsed empires , frontier regions , mafias , street gangs and so on ."
"The second explanation is that in many times and places , there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap ."
"In earlier times , when suffering and early death were common in one &apos;s own life , one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others . And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant , one puts a higher value on life in general ."
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne .
"And there are a number of possibilities , such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) .
"Chris Anderson : I loved that talk . I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of — that you were talking about , that Peter Singer talks about , is also driven by , just by technology , by greater visibility of the other , and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller . I mean , is that also a grain of truth ?"
"CA : Well , Steve , I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year . I think it &apos;s really important . Thank you so much ."
SP : My pleasure .
"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the University of California ."
Just think about this problem for a second .
"Here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand ."
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
"It can contemplate the meaning of infinity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of God ."
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the greatest mystery confronting human beings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain .
"And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about studying the brain ?"
"One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior ."
This is what I spoke about in the last TED .
"Today I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain ."
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
"Now , one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy , in Parma , by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues , is a group of neurons called mirror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
"For example , if I do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire ."
"If I reach out and pull an object , another neuron will fire , commanding me to pull that object ."
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else performing the same action ."
"So , here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something , but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something ."
And this is truly astonishing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neuron is adopting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?"
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .
Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for imitation and emulation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next slide ."
"So , how do you do imitation ? Why is imitation important ?"
"Mirror neurons and imitation , emulation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 75,000 &#93; to 100,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and interpret that person &apos;s behavior ."
All of that happened relatively quickly .
"Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago , 100,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly ."
"And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system , which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people &apos;s actions ."
"So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations ."
"So , this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian , instead of Darwinian ."
Darwinian evolution is slow ; it takes hundreds of thousands of years .
"A polar bear , to evolve a coat , will take thousands of generations , maybe 100,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just watch its parent kill another polar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fur on the body , and learn it in one step . What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population .
This is the basis . The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization .
"Now there is another kind of mirror neuron , which is involved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mirror neurons , just as there are mirror neurons for action , there are mirror neurons for touch ."
"In other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires ."
"But the same neuron , in some cases , will fire when I simply watch another person being touched ."
"So , it &apos;s empathizing the other person being touched ."
"So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m touched in different locations . Different neurons for different locations ."
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
"So , here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy ."
"Now , the question then arises : If I simply watch another person being touched , why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched ?"
"I mean , I empathize with that person but I don &apos;t literally feel the touch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched ."
"So , empathize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the touch , otherwise you &apos;ll get confused and muddled . &quot; &quot; Okay , so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch ."
"But if you remove the arm , you simply anesthetize my arm , so you put an injection into my arm , anesthetize the brachial plexus , so the arm is numb , and there is no sensations coming in , if I now watch you being touched , I literally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings ."
"So , I call them Gandhi neurons , or empathy neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
"All that &apos;s separating you from him , from the other person , is your skin ."
"Remove the skin , you experience that person &apos;s touch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
"And this , of course , is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , aloof from other human beings , inspecting the world , inspecting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connected not just via Facebook and Internet , you &apos;re actually quite literally connected by your neurons ."
"And there is whole chains of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else &apos;s consciousness .
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .
"So , you have a patient with a phantom limb . If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phantom ."
"Now the astonishing thing is , if you have pain in your phantom limb , you squeeze the other person &apos;s hand , massage the other person &apos;s hand , that relieves the pain in your phantom hand , almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged ."
"So , here you have my last slide ."
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
"C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures : science on the one hand , humanities on the other ; never the twain shall meet ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness , representation of self , what separates you from other human beings , what allows you to empathize with other human beings , and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization , which is unique to human beings . Thank you ."

"It &apos;s a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe , which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can roll the video that we have .
&#91; The Himalayas . &#93; ( Music ) The flat horizon that we &apos;ve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite : unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limited condition ."
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past 12 years .
"We maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales ."
"What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe , as we see ."
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world .
The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do — our main space shows in the dome .
"But what you see here is the result of , actually , internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their graduate work , and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden ."
"This software allows interactive use , so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live ."
"I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , where I live , and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology ."
"And so as we move out , we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies , as we see here , light-travel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essentially backing up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a containment around us — the afterglow of the Big Bang .
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .
"We &apos;ll fly outside it here , just to see this sort of containment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be meaningless , in the sense as before time ."
But this our containment of the visible universe .
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see .
"Coming back quickly , we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning , but these are positions , the latest positions of exoplanets that we &apos;ve mapped , and our sun here , obviously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the paths of Voyager 1 , Voyager 2 , Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10 , the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system ."
"Coming in closer , picking up Earth , orbit of the Moon , and we see the Earth ."
"This map can be updated , and we can add in new data ."
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission .
"But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases , ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon , Titan , which is larger that the planet Mercury , diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase ."
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this .
This software can also be networked between domes .
"We have a growing user base of this , and we network domes ."
And we can network between domes and classrooms .
We &apos;re actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia .
And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school .
"This is an image from Saturday , photographed by the Aqua satellite , but through the Uniview software ."
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is Nepal .
"This is , in fact , right here is the valley of Lhasa , right here in Tibet ."
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
"And just in closing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially ."
We carry that in us .
"And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe ."
Thank you .

"And this idea is nicely summarized by the British critic William Hazlitt , who wrote , &quot; &quot; Prejudice is the child of ignorance . &quot; &quot; I want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken . I want to try to convince you"
"So , start with stereotypes . You look at me , you know my name , you know certain facts about me , and you could make certain judgments ."
"You could make guesses about my ethnicity , my political affiliation , my religious beliefs ."
"And the thing is , these judgments tend to be accurate ."
We &apos;re very good at this sort of thing .
"And we &apos;re very good at this sort of thing because our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind , but rather it &apos;s a specific instance of a more general process , which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that fall into categories , and we can use our experience to make generalizations about novel instances of these categories ."
Now we might be wrong .
"But for the most part , we &apos;re good at this ."
"And in fact , Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay concedes this ."
But other times we &apos;re proud of it .
"( Video ) Anderson Cooper : Gets to your question , the question in the hall , on foreign aid ? Yes , ma &apos;am ."
Woman : The American people are suffering in our country right now .
Why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?
"AC : Governor Perry , what about that ?"
"And in fact , in general , people are often swayed by feelings of solidarity , loyalty , pride , patriotism , towards their country or towards their ethnic group ."
Now some of you may reject this .
"But even you sophisticates accept that there should be some pull towards the in-group in the domain of friends and family , of people you &apos;re close to , and so even you make a distinction between us versus them ."
Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919 .
And what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the Holocaust was wrong .
"Many people , most people at the time , viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans , some genetic taint , some authoritarian personality ."
And Tajfel rejected this .
"And to explore this , he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents ."
"And in one of his studies , what he did was he asked the British adolescents all sorts of questions , and then based on their answers , he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve looked at your answers , and based on the answers , I have determined that you are either &quot; &quot; — he told half of them — &quot; &quot; a Kandinsky lover , you love the work of Kandinsky , or a Klee lover , you love the work of Klee . &quot; &quot; It was entirely bogus ."
"But what he found was , these categories mattered , so when he later gave the subjects money , they would prefer to give the money to members of their own group than members of the other group ."
So one of the puppets might like green beans .
"They test the babies own food preferences , and babies typically prefer the graham crackers ."
"But the question is , does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets ? And it matters a lot ."
"( Laughter ) We see this sort of in-group , out-group psychology all the time ."
We see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies .
Stereotypes can also go awry .
"So often they &apos;re rational and useful , but sometimes they &apos;re irrational , they give the wrong answers , and other times they lead to plainly immoral consequences ."
And the case that &apos;s been most studied is the case of race .
"There was a fascinating study prior to the 2008 election where social psychologists looked at the extent to which the candidates were associated with America , as in an unconscious association with the American flag ."
"And in one of their studies they compared Obama and McCain , and they found McCain is thought of as more American than Obama , and to some extent , people aren &apos;t that surprised by hearing that ."
"But they were responding , of course , to the color of his skin ."
"In one recent study , researchers put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards ."
"Some of them were held by white hands , others by black hands ."
They were the same baseball cards .
"In research done at Stanford , psychologists explored the case of people sentenced for the murder of a white person ."
And there are different avenues .
"One avenue is to appeal to people &apos;s emotional responses , to appeal to people &apos;s empathy , and we often do that through stories ."
People don &apos;t tend to deluge people with facts and statistics .
This is Harriet Beecher Stowe .
And that could well have been a catalyst for great social change .
"So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people , and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not familiar with ."
It could be China or India or a country in Africa .
"And Smith says , how would you respond ?"
"And you would say , well that &apos;s too bad , and you &apos;d go on to the rest of your life ."
"But imagine instead , Smith says , you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped off ."
"Smith says , that would matter a lot ."
So this raises the question : Would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger ?
"Now answer this in the privacy of your own head , but Smith says , absolutely not , what a horrid thought ."
"And this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world &apos;s religions , in all of the different versions of the golden rule , and in all of the world &apos;s moral philosophies , which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view ."
We have bound ourselves .
And we bind ourselves in other ways as well .
I think prejudice and bias illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature .
Thank you .

"In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences ."
And I &apos;m going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia .
"So whether it &apos;s redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots , I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing , especially retail , sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places ."
"And in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges ."
So why is this important ?
"I think there are any number of reasons , and I &apos;m just going to not get into detail but mention a few ."
"Just from the perspective of climate change , the average urban dweller in the U.S."
"has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller , mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more , and living in detached buildings , you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of ."
"So strictly from a climate change perspective , the cities are already relatively green ."
The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs .
"All that driving that we &apos;ve been doing out in the suburbs , we have doubled the amount of miles we drive ."
It &apos;s increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency .
We &apos;re just driving so much more ; we haven &apos;t been able to keep up technologically .
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting .
Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles .
"And those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes ."
"And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore , again , because of our development patterns ."
And then there &apos;s finally — there &apos;s the affordability question .
"I mean , how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices ?"
"Suburban expansion to cheap land , for the last 50 years — you know the cheap land out on the edge — has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream ."
"But increasingly , the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability — which is basically our model — those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs ."
"For instance , here in Atlanta , about half of households make between $ 20,000 and $ 50,000 a year , and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation ."
"I mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures ."
That &apos;s before we got up to the four bucks a gallon .
"You know , none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs , and they &apos;re not going down any time soon ."
"Whether you love suburbia &apos;s leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips , there are reasons why it &apos;s important to retrofit ."
But is it practical ?
I think it is .
"June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade , and we &apos;ve found over 80 varied projects ."
"But that they &apos;re really all market driven , and what &apos;s driving the market in particular — number one — is major demographic shifts ."
"We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place , but that &apos;s really not the case anymore ."
"Since 2000 , already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them ."
We just haven &apos;t caught up with the actual realities of this .
"The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now : the Baby Boomers retiring — and then there &apos;s a gap , Generation X , which is a small generation ."
They &apos;re still having kids — but Generation Y hasn &apos;t even started hitting child-rearing age .
They &apos;re the other big generation .
"So as a result of that , demographers predict that through 2025 , 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them ."
"And the market research , consumer research , asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand — and we &apos;re already seeing it — for more urban lifestyles within suburbia ."
"That basically , the Boomers want to be able to age in place , and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle , but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia ."
The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt .
"Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band , but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots — and suburbia is full of them ."
"When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown , it made sense to just build surface parking lots ."
"But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again , as we &apos;ve just continued to sprawl , and they now have a relatively central location ."
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots .
"It now makes sense to go back in , build a deck and build up on those sites ."
"So what do you do with a dead mall , dead office park ?"
"It turns out , all sorts of things ."
"In a slow economy like ours , re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies ."
So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that &apos;s been re-inhabited as art-space .
"It &apos;s now home to artist studios , theater groups , dance troupes ."
"It &apos;s not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was , but it &apos;s serving its community ."
It &apos;s keeping the lights on .
"It &apos;s becoming , I think , a really great institution ."
"Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes , as universities , and as all variety of office space ."
"We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well — lots of schools , lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one ."
"This was a little grocery store , a Food Lion grocery store , that is now a public library ."
"In addition to , I think , doing a beautiful adaptive reuse , they tore up some of the parking spaces , put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff , put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods ."
"And they &apos;ve made this , what was just a store along a commercial strip , into a community gathering space ."
"This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix , Arizona ."
"Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint , a gourmet grocery , and they put up a restaurant in the old post office ."
Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination .
"It &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over the strip across the street ."
"The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim , &quot; Walking distance to Le Grande Orange , &quot; because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call &quot; a third place . &quot;"
"If home is the first place and work is the second place , the third place is where you go to hang out and build community ."
"And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family , the family households , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places ."
"So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category , the next strategy : redevelopment ."
"Now , during the boom , there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density , a sort of compact , walkable urban neighborhoods ."
But some of them have been much more incremental .
"This is Mashpee Commons , the oldest retrofit that we &apos;ve found ."
"And it &apos;s just incrementally , over the last 20 years , built urbanism on top of its parking lots ."
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60 &apos;s strip shopping center .
"And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact , mixed-use New England village , and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side ."
"So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incremental ."
"Sometimes , it &apos;s all at once ."
"This is another infill project on the parking lots , this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C."
"When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site , the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street , several apartments and condo buildings , while keeping the existing office buildings ."
Here is the site in 1940 : It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville .
"By 1980 , it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right ."
"Today , the transit , the Main Street and the new housing have all been built ."
"Eventually , I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall ."
Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped .
Transit is a big driver of retrofits .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street .
"This one is one of my favorites , Belmar ."
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction .
There &apos;s massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines .
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
"It &apos;s now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets , two public parks , eight bus lines and a range of housing types , and so it &apos;s really given Lakewood , Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had ."
Here was the mall in its heyday .
They had their prom in the mall . They loved their mall .
So here &apos;s the site in 1975 with the mall .
"By 1995 , the mall has died ."
The department store has been kept — and we found this was true in many cases .
The department stores are multistory ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at projected build-out .
"This project , I think , has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods ."
"It &apos;s providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle ."
It &apos;s about two-thirds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new Main Street looks like .
"It &apos;s very successful , and it &apos;s helped to prompt — eight of the 13 regional malls in Denver have now , or have announced plans to be , retrofitted ."
But it &apos;s important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring — just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city .
"No , it &apos;s pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties ."
"And so it &apos;s giving people more choices , but it &apos;s not taking away choices ."
But it &apos;s also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability .
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California .
"They took the commercial strip shown on the black-and-white images below , and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town ."
"And it &apos;s transformed from being an ugly , unsafe , undesirable address , to becoming a beautiful , attractive , dignified sort of good address ."
"I mean now we &apos;re hoping we start to see it ; they &apos;ve already built City Hall , attracted two hotels ."
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree .
"So there &apos;s a lot of great things , but I &apos;d love to see more corridors getting retrofitting ."
But densification is not going to work everywhere .
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .
"There &apos;s a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint , Michigan ."
There &apos;s also a burgeoning suburban farming movement — sort of victory gardens meets the Internet .
"But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology , as in this example outside of Minneapolis ."
"When the shopping center died , the city restored the site &apos;s original wetlands , creating lakefront property , which then attracted private investment , the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years ."
So they &apos;ve managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time .
This is another re-greening example .
It also makes sense in very strong markets .
This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop .
And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit .
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat .
So I &apos;ve shown you some of the first generation of retrofits .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three challenges for the future .
The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale .
We need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened .
Where should we be redeveloping ?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta .
I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta 100 years from now .
"And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves — expensive , but simple ."
"One , in a hundred years , transit on all major rail and road corridors ."
"Two , in a hundred years , thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors ."
"It &apos;s a little extreme , but we &apos;ve got a little water problem ."
"In a hundred years , subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won &apos;t be viable ."
And so we &apos;ve created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production .
So the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits .
"And I close with this image of democracy in action : This is a protest that &apos;s happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring , Maryland on an Astroturf town green ."
"Now , retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism , and not without reason ; you don &apos;t get much more phony than an Astroturf town green ."
"I have to say , these are very hybrid places ."
They are new but trying to look old .
"They have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios ."
"Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia , but they &apos;re less diverse than cities ."
"And they are public places , but that are managed by private companies ."
And just the surface appearance are often — like the Astroturf here — they make me wince .
"So , you know , I mean I &apos;m glad that the urbanism is doing its job ."
"The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks , the streets and blocks , the putting in of public space , compromised as it may be , is still a really great thing ."
But we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
The final challenge is for all of you .
"I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places — more sustainable places , period ."
"But culturally , we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic , and we expect that ."
But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to .
"It &apos;s time to let them grow up , so I want you to all support the zoning changes , the road diets , the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you ."
Thank you .
How do they differ from the rest of us ?
"In two of the three great arenas of life , by the time Len was 30 , Len was enormously successful ."
"By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader ."
"Second , in play , he &apos;s a national champion bridge player ."
"And the reason he was , was that Len is a cold fish ."
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
"So , that &apos;s the second path ."
"This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally ."
"Now , OK , you can open your eyes ."
"And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ?"
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
"Allison Hunt : My three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?"
"Chris Anderson : No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes ."
"Reset the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fair ."
"AH : Oh my God , it &apos;s harsh up here ."
I mean I &apos;m nervous enough as it is .
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago .
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery .
Do you know that surgery ?
"Electric saw , power drill , totally disgusting unless you &apos;re David Bolinsky , in which case it &apos;s all truth and beauty ."
"Sure David , if it &apos;s not your hip , it &apos;s truth and beauty ."
"Anyway , I did have a really big epiphany around the situation , so Chris invited me to tell you about it ."
But first you need to know two things about me .
Just two things .
"I &apos;m Canadian , and I &apos;m the youngest of seven kids ."
"Now , in Canada , we have that great healthcare system ."
That means we get our new hips for free .
"And being the youngest of seven , I have never been at the front of the line for anything . OK ?"
So my hip had been hurting me for years .
"I finally went to the doctor , which was free ."
"And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free ."
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting — almost a year .
That is what free gets you .
"I met the surgeon , and he took some free X-rays , and I got a good look at them . And you know , even I could tell my hip was bad , and I actually work in marketing ."
"So he said , &quot; &quot; Allison , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table ."
I &apos;m going to replace your hip — it &apos;s about an 18-month wait . &quot; &quot; 18 more months .
"I &apos;d already waited 10 months , and I had to wait 18 more months ."
"You know , it &apos;s such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs ."
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for this TED .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa .
I would not have my new hip for TED2008 .
I would still be on my bad hip . That was so disappointing .
"So , I left his office and I was walking through the hospital , and that &apos;s when I had my epiphany ."
This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .
Oh yeah .
Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is ?
We do not think that way .
We don &apos;t talk about it . It &apos;s not even a consideration .
"In fact , when we &apos;re traveling abroad , it &apos;s how we identify fellow Canadians ."
"&quot; After you . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , no . After you . &quot;"
"Hey , are you from Canada ? &quot; &quot; Oh , me too ! Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; Great ! Excellent ! &quot;"
"So no , suddenly I wasn &apos;t averse to butting any geezer off the list ."
"Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing , or gardening ."
"No , no . Front of the line ."
"So by now I was walking the lobby , and of course , that hurt , because of my hip , and I kind of needed a sign ."
And I saw a sign .
"In the window of the hospital &apos;s tiny gift shop there was a sign that said , &quot; &quot; Volunteers Needed . &quot; &quot; Hmm ."
"Well , they signed me up immediately ."
"No reference checks . None of the usual background stuff , no ."
They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 .
Yeah . They needed some young blood .
"So , next thing you know , I had my bright blue volunteer vest , I had my photo ID , and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss ."
I worked alone .
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop .
"While ringing in hospital staff &apos;s Tic Tacs , I &apos;d casually ask , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; Then I &apos;d tell them , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m getting my hip replaced — in 18 months ."
"It &apos;s gonna be so great when the pain stops . Ow ! &quot; &quot; All the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer ."
"My next surgeon &apos;s appointment was , coincidentally , right after a shift at the gift shop ."
"So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification ."
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
"And you know , when he walked in , I could just tell that he saw them ."
"Moments later , I had a surgery date just weeks away , and a big fat prescription for Percocet ."
"Now , word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line ."
"And , you know , I &apos;m not even ashamed of that ."
Two reasons .
"First of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hip ."
"But also I intend to stick with the volunteering , which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all ."
"Even when a Canadian cheats the system , they do it in a way that benefits society ."
There &apos;s a group of people in Kenya .
People cross oceans to go see them .
These people are tall .
They jump high . They wear red .
And they kill lions .
"You might be wondering , who are these people ?"
These are the Maasais .
And you know what &apos;s cool ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The Maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors ."
The girls are brought up to be mothers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty ."
"My mother , my grandmother , my aunties , they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by ."
"( Laughter ) Cool , yeah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12 .
"My day started at 5 in the morning , milking the cows , sweeping the house , cooking for my siblings , collecting water , firewood ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife .
I went to school not because the Maasais &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was denied an education , and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living ."
Why did she say that ?
My father worked as a policeman in the city .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
"And whenever he came home , it was a different case ."
My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat .
She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would sell the cows , he would sell the products we had , and he went and drank with his friends in the bars ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any property , and by default , everything in my family anyway belongs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever questioned him , he beat her , abused her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dream ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
Teachers looked nice .
"They wear nice dresses , high-heeled shoes ."
"I found out later that they are uncomfortable , but I admired it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just writing on the board — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , compared to what I was doing in the farm ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in eighth grade , it was a determining factor ."
"In our tradition , there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women , and it &apos;s a rite of passage to womanhood ."
"And then I was just finishing my eighth grade , and that was a transition for me to go to high school ."
This was the crossroad .
"Once I go through this tradition , I was going to become a wife ."
"Well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass ."
So I talked — I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out .
I talked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ran away , my father will have a stigma , people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the ceremony ."
It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life .
"So he figured out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; okay , you &apos;ll go to school after the ceremony . &quot; &quot; I did . The ceremony happened ."
It &apos;s a whole week long of excitement .
It &apos;s a ceremony . People are enjoying it .
"And the day before the actual ceremony happens , we were dancing , having excitement , and through all the night we did not sleep ."
"The actual day came , and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in . Yes , we danced and danced ."
"We walked out to the courtyard , and there were a bunch of people waiting ."
They were all in a circle .
"And as we danced and danced , and we approached this circle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman sitting in the middle of it , and this woman was waiting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my sisters and a couple of other girls , and as I approached her , she looked at me , and I sat down ."
"And I sat down , and I opened my legs ."
"As I opened my leg , another woman came , and this woman was carrying a knife ."
"And as she carried the knife , she walked toward me and she held the clitoris , and she cut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I bled . I bled ."
"After bleeding for a while , I fainted thereafter ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m lucky , I never died — but many die ."
"It &apos;s practiced , it &apos;s no anesthesia , it &apos;s a rusty old knife , and it was difficult ."
"I was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse ."
We were taken care of .
"Three weeks later , I was healed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon .
"This man was wearing a white t-shirt , jeans , camera , white sneakers — and I &apos;m talking about white sneakers ."
"There is something about clothes , I think , and shoes ."
"They were sneakers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have paved roads . It was quite attractive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I admired that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"Don &apos;t you have a husband waiting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that part ."
"Just tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This gentleman , he helped me ."
"While I was in high school also , my dad was sick ."
"He got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"Everybody who is my dad &apos;s age , male in the community , is my father by default — my uncles , all of them — and they dictate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman &apos;s College in Lynchburg , Virginia , and I couldn &apos;t come without the support of the village , because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket ."
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here .
"But I needed the support of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lost opportunity ."
This should have been given to a boy . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition .
There &apos;s a belief among our people that morning brings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the morning , because there &apos;s good news in the morning ."
"And in the village also , there is one chief , an elder , who if he says yes , everybody will follow him ."
"So I went to him very early in the morning , as the sun rose ."
"The first thing he sees when he opens his door is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; My child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , Dad , I need help . Can you support me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I promised him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot; &quot; He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went — 16 more men — every single morning I went and visited them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to support me to come to get an education ."
"I arrived in America . As you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found snow !
"I found Wal-Marts , vacuum cleaners , and lots of food in the cafeteria ."
I was in a land of plenty .
"I enjoyed myself , but during that moment while I was here , I discovered a lot of things ."
"I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was 13 years old , it was called female genital mutilation ."
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya .
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we speak right now , three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation ."
I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman .
Those things made me angry .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my neighbors &apos; girls were getting married ."
"They were getting mutilated , and here , after I graduated from here , I worked at the U.N. , I went back to school to get my graduate work , the constant cry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; As I spoke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is blamed for that ."
"If she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she &apos;s punished ."
She &apos;s beaten .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a safe place . &quot; &quot; As we moved , and I went to talk to the fathers , the fathers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for boys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education ."
"Why can &apos;t they build a school for boys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they agreed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment ."
And they did . They donated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to meet one of the girls in that school .
"Angeline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had ."
"She &apos;s an orphan . Yes , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was older . She was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade ."
"Angeline had been moving from one place — because she &apos;s an orphan , she has no mother , she has no father — moving from one grandmother &apos;s house to another one , from aunties to aunties . She had no stability in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remember that day , and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline ."
"And yes , she was older to be in fourth grade ."
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
"Five months later , that is Angeline ."
A transformation had begun in her life .
Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top student when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best student , not just in our school , but in the entire division that we are in ."
That &apos;s Sharon . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s Evelyn . Five months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we speak right now , 125 girls will never be mutilated ."
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them opportunities where they can rise ."
"As we speak right now , women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we &apos;ve started in our community ."
( Applause ) I want to challenge you today .
"You are listening to me because you are here , very optimistic ."
You are somebody who is so passionate .
You are somebody who wants to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wants to see that war ends , no poverty ."
You are somebody who wants to make a difference .
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better .
"I want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will follow you ."
Be the first . People will follow you .
Be bold . Stand up . Be fearless . Be confident .
"Move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impacting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your community , you are going to change your country , and think about that . If you do that , and I do that , aren &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grandchildren ?"
And we will live in a very peaceful world . Thank you very much .

I have a question for you : Are you religious ?
Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person .
"Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference .
"( Laughter ) Okay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way , shape or form ? Raise your hand ."
"Okay , that &apos;s the majority ."
My Talk today is about self-transcendence .
It &apos;s just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away .
"And when that happens , the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings ."
We talk about being uplifted or elevated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor .
So here &apos;s the metaphor I &apos;m offering today .
"Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms , most of which we &apos;re very familiar with ."
But sometimes it &apos;s as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase .
We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness .
"In 1902 , the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience ."
He collected all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exciting to me is this young man , Stephen Bradley , had an encounter , he thought , with Jesus in 1820 ."
And here &apos;s what Bradley said about it .
"( Music ) ( Video ) Stephen Bradley : I thought I saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room , with arms extended , appearing to say to me , &quot; &quot; Come . &quot; &quot; The next day I rejoiced with trembling ."
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die .
This world had no place in my affections .
"Previous to this time , I was very selfish and self-righteous ."
"But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could , with a feeling heart , forgive my worst enemies ."
"JH : So note how Bradley &apos;s petty , moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase ."
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving .
The world &apos;s many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase .
Others use psychedelic drugs .
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god .
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature .
Others overcome their self at raves .
But here &apos;s the weirdest place of all : war .
"So many books about war say the same thing , that nothing brings people together like war ."
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences .
I &apos;m going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray .
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II .
( Video ) Glenn Gray : Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; passes insensibly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becomes &quot; our &quot; and individual faith loses its central importance ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy .
"I may fall , but I do not die , for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life ."
It feels somehow uplifting .
This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim .
"Durkheim even called us Homo duplex , or two-level man ."
The lower level he called the level of the profane .
Now profane is the opposite of sacred .
It just means ordinary or common .
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals .
We want to satisfy our individual desires .
We pursue our individual goals .
But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change .
"Individuals unite into a team , a movement or a nation , which is far more than the sum of its parts ."
"Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community ."
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .
"And once people circle around some sacred object or value , they &apos;ll then work as a team and fight to defend it ."
"Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum , of making a group out of individuals ."
Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended .
"Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square , which brought down a dictator ."
So let me summarize where we are .
I &apos;m offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred .
So here &apos;s the million-dollar question for social scientists like me : Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?
"Is it a product of natural selection , like our hands ?"
Well many scientists who study religion take this view .
"The New Atheists , for example , argue that religion is a set of memes , sort of parasitic memes , that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff , self-destructive stuff , like suicide bombing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves ?"
How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The Descent of Man , &quot; &quot; Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups ."
But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got competition going on within groups and across groups .
So here &apos;s a group of guys on a college crew team .
Within this team there &apos;s competition .
There are guys competing with each other .
"The slowest rowers , the weakest rowers , are going to get cut from the team ."
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport .
"So within the team , their interests are actually pitted against each other ."
And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys .
Maybe he &apos;ll badmouth his chief rival to the coach .
"But while that competition is going on within the boat , this competition is going on across boats ."
They can only win if they all pull together as a team .
"I mean , these things sound trite , but they are deep evolutionary truths ."
Let me illustrate this for you .
"Suppose we &apos;ve got a group of little organisms — they can be bacteria , they can be hamsters ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s suppose that this little group here , they evolved to be cooperative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve doubled in size , you &apos;ll see them split , and that &apos;s how they reproduce and the population grows ."
"We start with just one green , and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food ."
"And in short order , the cooperators are done for ."
The free-riders have taken over .
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has solved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat .
"For example , why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA , totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism .
A superorganism can basically take what it wants .
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .
What I &apos;ve shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history .
"Darwin &apos;s laws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different ."
"It happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple , primitive nests , or hives ."
"And it happened again , even more spectacularly , in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures , they came together around a hearth or a campfire , they divided labor , they began painting their bodies , they spoke their own dialects , and eventually they worshiped their own gods ."
"Once they were all in the same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside ."
"And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation — a force for construction and destruction ."
Look at the people in these photos I &apos;ve been showing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pursuing their self-interest ?
"Or are they pursuing communal interest , which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"Okay , so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full-spectrum sort of way .
"( Music ) ( Video ) Jonathan Haidt : We humans have many varieties of religious experience , as William James explained ."
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves .
"The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected ."
"We are Homo duplex , as Durkheim explained ."
"And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection , as Darwin explained ."
"If it is an adaptation , then we evolved to be religious ."
"I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects , people and ideas ."
This is why politics is so tribal .
"Politics is partly profane , it &apos;s partly about self-interest , but politics is also about sacredness ."
It &apos;s about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the eternal struggle between good and evil , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good team ."
"And most importantly , if the staircase is real , it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life ."
"Because human beings are , to some extent , hivish creatures like bees ."
We &apos;re bees . We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment .
We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed .
Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom .
But sometimes we wonder : Is this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s missing ?
"What &apos;s missing is that we are Homo duplex , but modern , secular society was built to satisfy our lower , profane selves ."
It &apos;s really comfortable down here on the lower level .
"Come , have a seat in my home entertainment center ."
One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top .
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia .
They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into .
They &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger .
And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an island entire of itself .
"Every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . &quot; &quot; JH : Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life .
But I want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man .
This is Hermann Goering .
"Goering was Hitler &apos;s second in command in World War II , his designated successor ."
"And like Hitler , Goering fancied himself a collector of art ."
"Hitler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his favorite artwork ever .
"World War II came to an end , and Goering was captured , tried at Nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death ."
Then the Allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him .
"Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason , which is itself punishable by death ."
"Six weeks into his prison sentence , van Meegeren confessed ."
But he didn &apos;t confess to treason .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi ."
I painted it myself ; I &apos;m a forger . &quot; &quot; Now nobody believed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll prove it ."
"Bring me a canvas and some paint , and I will paint a Vermeer much better than I sold that disgusting Nazi ."
He painted a beautiful Vermeer .
And then the charges of treason were dropped .
"He had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about van Meegeren , but I want to turn now to Goering , who &apos;s pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg ."
"Now Goering was , by all accounts , a terrible man ."
His American interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath .
He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a shock .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The Supper at Emmaus &quot; &quot; which was viewed as Vermeer &apos;s finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery ."
"It was not that painting , but that painting ."
"And when that was discovered , it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psychologists — why do origins matter so much ?
Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we &apos;re snobs , because we &apos;re focused on status ."
"Among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an original than a forgery because there &apos;s always going to be fewer originals than forgeries ."
"that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respond to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"Rather , our response is conditioned on our beliefs , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hidden nature is ."
"I want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we react to things ."
"So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences ."
So take food .
Would you eat this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It depends . What is it ? &quot; &quot; Some of you would eat it if it &apos;s pork , but not beef ."
Few of you would eat it if it &apos;s a rat or a human .
Some of you would eat it only if it &apos;s a strangely colored piece of tofu .
That &apos;s not so surprising .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you &apos;re eating .
So one demonstration of this was done with young children .
"How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk — to think they taste better ?"
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine ?
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist .
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine .
"Everybody , of course , drinks exactly the same wine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re drinking expensive stuff , parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
Or take sex .
These are stimuli I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pictures , they &apos;ll say these are fairly attractive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is male , the one on the right is female ."
"If that belief turns out to be mistaken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you &apos;re looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do .
( Laughter ) A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome .
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion .
"Now often , a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic ."
But there &apos;s at least one case where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending .
This was recorded in 1931 .
The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction .
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people ."
( Laughter ) The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all .
"According to an unconfirmed report , a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes ."
They were the ones thrown at George Bush at an Iraqi press conference several years ago .
"With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of factors , what sort of history , matters for the objects that people like ."
"So in one of our experiments , we asked people to name a famous person who they adored , a living person they adored ."
So one answer was George Clooney .
"Then we asked them , &quot; How much would you pay for George Clooney &apos;s sweater ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fair amount — more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn &apos;t adore .
Then we asked other groups of subjects — we gave them different restrictions and different conditions .
"So for instance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; Look , you can buy the sweater , but you can &apos;t tell anybody you own it , and you can &apos;t resell it . &quot; &quot; That drops the value of it , suggesting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really causes an effect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; Look , you could resell it , you could boast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s thoroughly washed . &quot; &quot; That causes a huge drop in the value ."
"As my wife put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve washed away the Clooney cooties . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
"But I don &apos;t want a duplicate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a snob and want to boast about having an original ."
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock ?
"Okay . Who here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then reported that her father was coaching her .
"When this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , physically , but the history had changed ."
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D.C. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a brief clip of this .
"( Violin music ) After being there for three-quarters of an hour , he made 32 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell , you have to know you &apos;re listening to Joshua Bell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
So she &apos;s stunned that he &apos;s standing in a subway station .
So she &apos;s struck with pity .
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from John Cage &apos;s modernist composition , &quot; 4 &apos; 33 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different views on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes .
"( Laughter ) For a dollar 99 , you can listen to that silence , which is different than other forms of silence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about pleasure , but what I want to suggest is that everything I &apos;ve said applies as well to pain ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts ."
One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner .
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks .
So it was a series of five painful shocks .
"The second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The third drops , the fourth , the fifth ."
The pain gets less .
"In the other condition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose — knows they &apos;re shocking them ."
The first shock hurts like hell .
"The second shock hurts just as much , and the third and the fourth and the fifth ."
"The most extreme example of this is that in some cases , pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure ."
"The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."

"Someone once said that politics is , of course , &quot; &quot; showbiz for ugly people . &quot; &quot; So , on that basis , I feel like I &apos;ve really arrived ."
"The other thing to think of is what an honor it is , as a politician , to give a TED talk , particularly here in the U.K. , where the reputation of politics , with the expenses scandal , has sunk so low ."
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians .
"And someone asked , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s no shortage of politicians , no one really minds what happens to them and , after all , there are some things that rats just won &apos;t do . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I know you all love data , so I &apos;m starting with a data-rich slide ."
"This , I think , is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics , and that is : We have run out of money ."
We have vast budget deficits .
"This is my global public debt clock , and , as you can see , it &apos;s 32 trillion and counting ."
"And I think what this leads to is a very simple recognition , that there &apos;s one question in politics at the moment above all other , and it &apos;s this one : How do we make things better without spending more money ?"
"Because there isn &apos;t going to be a lot of money to improve public services , or to improve government , or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about ."
"So what follows from that is that if you think it &apos;s all about money — you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money , you can only measure progress by spending money — you &apos;re going to have a pretty miserable time ."
"But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being — things like your family relationships , friendship , community , values — then , actually , this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics ."
"And the really simple argument I want to make tonight , the really straightforward argument is this : That if we combine the right political philosophy , the right political thinking , with the incredible information revolution that has taken place , and that all of you know so much more about than I do , I think there &apos;s an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics , remake government , remake public services , and achieve what &apos;s up on that slide , which is a big increase in our well-being ."
That &apos;s the argument I want to make tonight .
"So , starting with the political philosophy ."
Now I &apos;m not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers .
Of course we don &apos;t .
But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate .
"The first is this : We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives , if you give people more choice , if you put them in the driving seat , then actually , you can create a stronger and better society ."
"And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today , I think you can completely , as I &apos;ve said , remake politics , remake government , remake your public services ."
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature .
"Politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be ."
"Now , if you combine this very simple , very conservative thought — go with the grain of human nature — with all the advances in behavioral economics , some of which we were just hearing about , again , I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being , in happiness , in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money ."
"Now , why do I think now is the moment to make this argument ?"
"Well , I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to suffer a short , condensed history lesson about what I would say are the three passages of history : the pre-bureaucratic age , the bureaucratic age and what we now live in , which I think is a post-bureaucratic age ."
"A simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control , then we went to a world of central control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control ."
"Local power , central power , now , people power ."
"Now , here is King Cnut , king a thousand years ago ."
Thought he could turn back the waves ; couldn &apos;t turn back the waves .
"Couldn &apos;t actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thousand years ago , while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country , there wasn &apos;t much you were in charge of ."
"You weren &apos;t in charge of policing , justice , education , health , welfare ."
You could just about go to war and that was about it .
"This was the pre-bureaucratic age , an age in which everything had to be local ."
You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information because travel was so restricted .
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age .
"Next part of the cold history lesson , the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution ."
"Suddenly , all sorts of transport , travel information were possible , and this gave birth to , what I like to call , the bureaucratic age ."
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully . There we are .
"Suddenly , you have the big , strong , central state ."
"It was able — but only it was able — to organize health care , education , policing , justice ."
"And it was a world of , as I say , not local power , but now central power ."
It had sucked all that power up from the localities .
It was able to do that itself .
"The next great stage , which all of you are so familiar with : the massive information revolution ."
"Just consider this one fact : One hundred years ago , sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars ."
"Right now , here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else , and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost , and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything ."
"So we &apos;re now living in a post-bureaucratic age , where genuine people power is possible ."
"Now , what does this mean for our politics , for our public services , for our government ?"
"Well I can &apos;t , in the time I &apos;ve got , give huge numbers of examples , but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change ."
"And this is so obvious , in a way , because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop , the way we travel , the way that business is done ."
"That is already happened ; the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways , but it hasn &apos;t , in every way , yet touched our government ."
"So , how could this happen ?"
"Well , I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference : in transparency , in greater choice and in accountability , in giving us that genuine people power ."
"If we take transparency , here is one of my favorite websites , the Missouri Accountability Portal ."
"In the old days , only the government could hold the information , and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it ."
"Now here , on one website , one state in America , every single dollar spent by that government is searchable , is analyzable , is checkable ."
Think of the huge change that means : Any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent .
"Anyone thinking , &quot; &quot; I could do that service better , I could deliver it cheaper , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all available there ."
"We have only , in government and in politics , started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution ."
"So , complete transparency will make a huge difference ."
"In this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see ."
"We &apos;re going to make every contract — we &apos;re announcing this today — available on the Internet so anyone can see what the terms are , what the conditions are , driving huge value for money , but also huge increases , I believe , in well-being as well ."
"Choice . Now you all shop online , compare online , do everything online , and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education , or health care or policing , and you &apos;re going to see this change massively ."
"We should be making this change with the information revolution in our country , with searchable health sites , so you can see what operations work out properly , what records doctors have , the cleanliness of hospitals , who does best at infection control — all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health is now available for all of us to see ."
And the third of these big changes : accountability .
"This , I think , is a huge change ."
It is a crime map . This is a crime map from Chicago .
"So , instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where , and we have to employ people in government to try and hold the police to account , suddenly , we &apos;ve got this vast opportunity for people power , where we , as citizens , can see what crimes are being committed — where , when and by whom — and we can hold the police to account ."
"And you can see this looks a bit like a chef &apos;s hat , but actually that &apos;s an assault , the one in blue ."
"You can see what crime is committed where , and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account ."
"So those three ways — transparency , accountability and choice — will make a huge difference ."
"Now I also said the other principle that I think we should work on is understanding of people , is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more ."
"Now , we &apos;re got a huge revolution in understanding of why people behave in the way that they do , and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use ."
We &apos;re working with some of these people .
"We &apos;re being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book ."
"Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple , and I love ."
We want to get people to be more energy efficient .
"Why ? It cuts fuel poverty , it cuts their bills , and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time ."
How do you do it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home ."
We even had — one government minister once told us to brush our teeth in the dark .
I don &apos;t think they lasted very long .
Look at what this does . This is a simple piece of behavioral economics .
"The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending , to show them what their neighbors are spending , and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending ."
That sort of behavioral economics can transform people &apos;s behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve .
Other examples are recycling .
We all know we need to recycle more .
How do we make it happen ?
"All the proof from America is that actually , if you pay people to recycle , if you give them a carrot rather than a stick , you can transform their behavior ."
So what does all this add up to ?
Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years .
"Obviously , here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation , &quot; Ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &quot; an incredibly noble sentiment ."
"But when he made that speech , what could you do to build the stronger , better society ?"
"You could fight for your country , you could die for your country , you could serve in your country &apos;s civil service , but you didn &apos;t really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now ."
"And I think an even more wonderful speech , which I &apos;m going to read a big chunk of , which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money , and more that we should try and measure than money ."
"And it is Robert Kennedy &apos;s beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little : It &quot; &quot; does not allow for the health of our children , the quality of their education , or the joy of their play ."
"It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages , the intelligence of our public debate ."
"It measures neither our wit nor our courage , neither our wisdom nor our learning , neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country ."
"It measures everything , in short , except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot; &quot; Again , a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago , and a beautiful dream 40 years ago , but now with the huge advances in information technology , with the massive changes in behavioral economics , with all that we know about how you advance well-being , that if we combine those insights of giving power to people , and using information to make that possible , and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature , while at the same time , understanding why people behave in the way they do ,"
it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago .
Thank you .

Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
It &apos;s an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey .
Let me begin with my parents .
I &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
"Many years ago , when I was born in the &apos; 50s — &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s didn &apos;t belong to girls in India ."
They belonged to boys .
"They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents , and girls would be dolled up to get married ."
"My family , in my city , and almost in the country , was unique ."
"We were four of us , not one , and fortunately no boys ."
We were four girls and no boys .
And my parents were part of a landed property family .
"My father defied his own grandfather , almost to the point of disinheritance , because he decided to educate all four of us ."
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education .
"As I &apos;ve said , when we &apos;re born , we don &apos;t choose our parents , and when we go to school , we don &apos;t choose our school ."
Children don &apos;t choose a school .
They just get the school which parents choose for them .
So this is the foundation time which I got .
"I grew up like this , and so did my other three sisters ."
"And my father used to say at that time , &quot; I &apos;m going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world . &quot;"
"I don &apos;t know if he really meant &#91; that &#93; , but it happened ."
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
"One is a British , another is an American and the third is a Canadian ."
So we are four of us in four corners of the world .
"And since I said they &apos;re my role models , I followed two things which my father and mother gave me ."
"One , they said , &quot; &quot; Life is on an incline ."
"You either go up , or you come down . &quot; &quot; And the second thing , which has stayed with me , which became my philosophy of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad ."
"Out of 100 , 90 are your creation ."
They &apos;re good . They &apos;re your creation . Enjoy it .
"If they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . Learn from it ."
Ten are nature-sent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
"It &apos;s like a death of a relative , or a cyclone , or a hurricane , or an earthquake ."
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just respond to the situation .
But that response comes out of those 90 points .
"Since I &apos;m a product of this philosophy , of 90 / 10 , and secondly , &quot; &quot; life on an incline , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the way I grew up to be valuing what I got ."
"I &apos;m a product of opportunities , rare opportunities in the &apos; 50s and the &apos; 60s , which girls didn &apos;t get , and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique ."
"Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry , and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities ."
I thought I must tell you this .
"Why I said this , is the background ."
This is what comes next .
"I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman , a woman with indefatigable stamina , because I used to run for my tennis titles , etc ."
"But I joined the Indian Police Service , and then it was a new pattern of policing ."
"For me the policing stood for power to correct , power to prevent and power to detect ."
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India — the power to prevent .
"Because normally it was always said , power to detect , and that &apos;s it , or power to punish ."
"But I decided no , it &apos;s a power to prevent , because that &apos;s what I learned when I was growing up ."
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
"So this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men ."
"I didn &apos;t want to make it different from the men , but it was different , because this was the way I was different ."
And I redefined policing concepts in India .
"I &apos;m going to take you on two journeys , my policing journey and my prison journey ."
"What you see , if you see the title called &quot; &quot; PM &apos;s car held . &quot; &quot; This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket ."
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time in India , and I can tell you , that &apos;s the last time you &apos;re hearing about it ."
"It &apos;ll never happen again in India , because now it was once and forever ."
"And the rule was , because I was sensitive , I was compassionate , I was very sensitive to injustice , and I was very pro-justice ."
"That &apos;s the reason , as a woman , I joined the Indian Police Service ."
"I had other options , but I didn &apos;t choose them ."
So I &apos;m going to move on .
"This is about tough policing , equal policing ."
"Now I was known as &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to listen . &quot; &quot; So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings , postings which others would say no ."
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .
Normally police officers don &apos;t want to do prison .
"They sent me to prison to lock me up , thinking , &quot; &quot; Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to ."
Let &apos;s lock her up . &quot; &quot; Here I got a prison assignment .
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals .
"Obviously , it was ."
"But 10,000 men , of which only 400 were women — 10,000 — 9,000 plus about 600 were men ."
"Terrorists , rapists , burglars , gangsters — some of them I &apos;d sent to jail as a police officer outside ."
And then how did I deal with them ?
"The first day when I went in , I didn &apos;t know how to look at them ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? &quot; &quot; When I looked at the group , I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? &quot; &quot; They saw me as a young , short woman wearing a pathan suit . I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? &quot; &quot;"
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? Do you want to pray ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; All right , let &apos;s pray . &quot; &quot; I prayed for them , and things started to change ."
This is a visual of education inside the prison .
"Friends , this has never happened , where everybody in the prison studies ."
I started this with community support .
Government had no budget .
"It was one of the finest , largest volunteerism in any prison in the world ."
This was initiated in Delhi prison .
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class .
These are hundreds of classes .
"Nine to eleven , every prisoner went into the education program — the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten ."
We converted this into an ashram — from a prison to an ashram through education .
I think that &apos;s the bigger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
Teachers were prisoners . Teachers were volunteers .
Books came from donated schoolbooks .
Stationery was donated .
"Everything was donated , because there was no budget of education for the prison ."
"Now if I &apos;d not done that , it would have been a hellhole ."
That &apos;s the second landmark .
"I want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world ."
"One , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see ."
"Secondly , this concept ."
"This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners ."
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation .
This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor .
And this is what transformed .
"You want to know more about this , go and see this film , &quot; &quot; Doing Time , Doing Vipassana . &quot; &quot; You will hear about it , and you will love it ."
"And write to me on KiranBedi.com , and I &apos;ll respond to you ."
Let me show you the next slide .
"I took the same concept of mindfulness , because , why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison ?"
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind .
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control .
"Not by preaching , not by telling , not by reading , but by addressing your mind ."
"I took the same thing to the police , because police , equally , were prisoners of their minds , and they felt as if it was &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; they , &quot; &quot; and that the people don &apos;t cooperate ."
This worked .
This is a feedback box called a petition box .
"This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints , listen to grievances ."
This was a magic box .
This was a sensitive box .
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison .
"If you see somebody in the blue — yeah , this guy — he was a prisoner , and he was a teacher ."
"And you see , everybody &apos;s busy . There was no time to waste ."
Let me wrap it up .
"I &apos;m currently into movements , movements of education of the under-served children , which is thousands — India is all about thousands ."
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India .
"That &apos;s a big way we , as a small group of activists , have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India ."
"Friends , you will hear a lot about it ."
"That &apos;s the movement at the moment I &apos;m driving , and that &apos;s the movement and ambition of my life ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Right now you have a movie playing inside your head .
It &apos;s an amazing multi-track movie .
"It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you &apos;re seeing and hearing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it ."
Your movie has smell and taste and touch .
"It has a sense of your body , pain , hunger , orgasms ."
"It has emotions , anger and happiness ."
"It has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you ."
And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly .
"This movie is your stream of consciousness , the subject of experience of the mind and the world ."
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
Each of us is conscious .
"We all have our own inner movie , you and you and you ."
There &apos;s nothing we know about more directly .
"At least , I know about my consciousness directly ."
I can &apos;t be certain that you guys are conscious .
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living .
"If we weren &apos;t conscious , nothing in our lives would have meaning or value ."
"But at the same time , it &apos;s the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe ."
Why are we conscious ?
Why do we have these inner movies ?
"Why aren &apos;t we just robots who process all this input , produce all that output , without experiencing the inner movie at all ?"
"Right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions ."
"I &apos;m going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science , some radical ideas may be needed ."
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible .
"Science , by its nature , is objective ."
"Consciousness , by its nature , is subjective ."
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
"For much of the 20th century , that view held sway ."
"Psychologists studied behavior objectively , neuroscientists studied the brain objectively , and nobody even mentioned consciousness ."
"Even 30 years ago , when TED got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness ."
"Now , about 20 years ago , all that began to change ."
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness .
"And since then , there &apos;s been a real explosion , a flowering of scientific work on consciousness ."
And this work has been wonderful . It &apos;s been great .
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far .
"The centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations , correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness ."
We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago .
"Now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy ."
But this is still a science of correlations .
It &apos;s not a science of explanations .
"We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience , but we don &apos;t know why they do ."
"I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness , the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with ."
"But in a certain sense , those are the easy problems ."
No knock on the neuroscientists .
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness .
Why is there this inner subjective movie ?
"Right now , we don &apos;t really have a bead on that ."
"And you might say , let &apos;s just give neuroscience a few years ."
"It &apos;ll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams , like hurricanes , like life , and we &apos;ll figure it out ."
"Now , I &apos;m a scientific materialist at heart ."
"I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work ."
So I think we &apos;re at a kind of impasse here .
"We &apos;ve got this wonderful , great chain of explanation , we &apos;re used to it , where physics explains chemistry , chemistry explains biology , biology explains parts of psychology ."
But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to fit into this picture .
"On the one hand , it &apos;s a datum that we &apos;re conscious ."
"On the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world ."
"So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly , one that we need to integrate into our view of the world , but we don &apos;t yet see how ."
"Faced with an anomaly like this , radical ideas may be needed , and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically ."
"Now , there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be ."
"My friend Dan Dennett , who &apos;s here today , has one ."
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion .
"Actually , all we &apos;ve got to do is explain the objective functions , the behaviors of the brain , and then we &apos;ve explained everything that needs to be explained ."
"Well I say , more power to him ."
That &apos;s the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain-based theory of consciousness .
"At the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory ."
"In the time remaining , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise ."
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks : space and time and mass .
"They postulate fundamental laws governing them , like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics ."
These fundamental properties and laws aren &apos;t explained in terms of anything more basic .
"Rather , they &apos;re taken as primitive , and you build up the world from there ."
"Now sometimes , the list of fundamentals expands ."
"In the 19th century , Maxwell figured out that you can &apos;t explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals — space , time , mass , Newton &apos;s laws — so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern ."
I think that &apos;s the situation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
"If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals — space , time , mass , charge — then as a matter of logic , you need to expand the list ."
"The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building block of nature ."
This doesn &apos;t mean you suddenly can &apos;t do science with it .
This opens up the way for you to do science with it .
"What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals : space , time , mass , physical processes ."
Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-shirt .
"We don &apos;t know what those laws are yet , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re after ."
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal .
Every system might have some degree of consciousness .
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness .
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking .
"It &apos;s not that a photon is wracked with angst because it &apos;s thinking , &quot; &quot; Aww , I &apos;m always buzzing around near the speed of light ."
"I never get to slow down and smell the roses . &quot; &quot; No , not like that ."
"But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw , subjective feeling , some primitive precursor to consciousness ."
This may sound a bit kooky to you .
"I mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?"
"Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental ."
"If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to suppose that it might be universal too , the way they are ."
"It &apos;s also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us , it &apos;s much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures , where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature ."
"Wherever there &apos;s information processing , there &apos;s consciousness ."
"Complex information processing , like in a human , complex consciousness ."
"Simple information processing , simple consciousness ."
"A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist , Giulio Tononi , has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory ."
"He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi , measuring the amount of information integrated in a system ."
And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness .
"In a mouse , medium degree of information integration , still pretty significant , pretty serious amount of consciousness ."
"But as you go down to worms , microbes , particles , the amount of phi falls off ."
"The amount of information integration falls off , but it &apos;s still non-zero ."
"In effect , he &apos;s proposing a fundamental law of consciousness : high phi , high consciousness ."
Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world .
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract .
"It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that underlies it ."
"As Stephen Hawking puts it , what puts the fire into the equations ?"
"Well , on the panpsychist view , you can leave the equations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness ."
"That &apos;s what physics really is ultimately doing , describing the flux of consciousness ."
"On this view , it &apos;s consciousness that puts the fire into the equations ."
"On that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra ."
It &apos;s there right at its heart .
Some of these may be counterintuitive .
"I used to think I shouldn &apos;t eat anything which is conscious , so therefore I should be vegetarian ."
"Now , if you &apos;re a panpsychist and you take that view , you &apos;re going to go very hungry ."
"So I think when you think about it , this tends to transfigure your views , whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness ."
"What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie &quot; &quot; Her , &quot; &quot; Samantha ?"
Is she conscious ?
"If that &apos;s right , it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off ."
"Finally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups , the planet ."
Does Canada have its own consciousness ?
"I don &apos;t know the answer to that question , but I think it &apos;s at least one worth taking seriously ."
"Okay , so this panpsychist vision , it is a radical one , and I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s correct ."
"I &apos;m actually more confident about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , than about the second one , that it &apos;s universal ."
"If not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy ."
We can &apos;t expect to solve it overnight .
But I do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .
"Understanding consciousness is a real key , I think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves ."
It may just take the right crazy idea .
Thank you .

So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living .
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance .
"I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself , because the snow had melted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a movie . But I found that on the — I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Zurich , and it was about flying saucers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
"And I thought , well , since I can &apos;t go to the movies , at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers ."
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting .
"Instead of talking about little green men , he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war , and now they &apos;re projecting flying saucers into the sky ."
He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war .
And this seemed very interesting to me .
And I started reading his books after that lecture .
"And that was Carl Jung , whose name or work I had no idea about ."
Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness .
"This is a typical result that many people have presented , and there are many variations on it ."
"But this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy ."
And that hasn &apos;t changed at all .
"Whereas the personal income , on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation , has more than doubled , almost tripled , in that period ."
"But you find essentially the same results , namely , that after a certain basic point — which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level — increases in material well-being don &apos;t seem to affect how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contributes to unhappiness , but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness ."
"So my research has been focused more on — after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where — in everyday life , in our normal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I began to look at creative people — first artists and scientists , and so forth — trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expect either fame or fortune , but which made their life meaningful and worth doing ."
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the &apos; 70s .
And the interview was 40 pages long .
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview .
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well .
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ecstasy &quot; &quot; in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something ."
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines .
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement — whether it &apos;s China , Greece , the Hindu civilization , or the Mayas , or Egyptians — what we know about them is really about their ecstasies , not about their everyday life ."
"We know the temples they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the circuses , the arenas , the theaters ."
"These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated , more ordered form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this arena , which is built like a Greek amphitheatre , is a place for ecstasy also ."
We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks , and as he does that , he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like Jennifer did in her improvisation , a new reality — that is , a moment of ecstasy — he enters that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn &apos;t exist .
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration .
"But actually , our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hungry or tired .
"His body disappears , his identity disappears from his consciousness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough attention , like none of us do , to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration , and at the same time to feel that he exists ."
So existence is temporarily suspended .
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any awe or wonder , because I can &apos;t compose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s telling you here is that obviously this automatic , spontaneous process that he &apos;s describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique ."
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can &apos;t be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field .
"Whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just flows out ."
And because all of these people I started interviewing — this was an interview which is over 30 years old — so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the &quot; &quot; flow experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different realms .
"For instance , a poet describes it in this form ."
This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States .
"And it describes the same effortless , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state ."
"This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky — a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity , when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other activities .
"For instance , this is another student of mine , Susan Jackson from Australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world ."
"And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater , the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes automatically , if you merge yourself with the music , and so forth ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most recent book I wrote , called &quot; &quot; Good Business , &quot; &quot; where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical , very socially responsible ."
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job ."
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed .
"She is the founder of Body Shop , the natural cosmetics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka , who was at that time starting out Sony without any money , without a product — they didn &apos;t have a product , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation , be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart &apos;s content ."
I couldn &apos;t improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colleagues around the world , done over 8,000 interviews of people — from Dominican monks , to blind nuns , to Himalayan climbers , to Navajo shepherds — who enjoy their work ."
"And regardless of the culture , regardless of education or whatever , there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow ."
"There &apos;s this focus that , once it becomes intense , leads to a sense of ecstasy , a sense of clarity : you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other ; you get immediate feedback ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger ."
"And once the conditions are present , what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake ."
"In our studies , we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme ."
"And we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can establish an average , which is the center of the diagram ."
"That would be your mean level of challenge and skill , which will be different from that of anybody else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average ."
"And you may be doing things very differently from other people , but for everyone that flow channel , that area there , will be when you are doing what you really like to do — play the piano , be with your best friend , perhaps work , if work is what provides flow for you ."
And then the other areas become less and less positive .
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there .
"Your skills are not quite as high as they should be , but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill ."
"So , arousal is the area where most people learn from , because that &apos;s where they &apos;re pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that — going back to flow — then they develop higher skills ."
"Control is also a good place to be , because there you feel comfortable , but not very excited ."
It &apos;s not very challenging any more .
"And if you want to enter flow from control , you have to increase the challenges ."
So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into .
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .
Relaxation is fine — you still feel OK .
"Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your skills , there &apos;s no challenge ."
"Unfortunately , a lot of people &apos;s experience is in apathy ."
"The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television ; the next one is being in the bathroom , sitting ."
"Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it ."
So the question we are trying to address — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice , but unfortunately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our mandate is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Welcome to TED .
Richard Branson : Thank you very much . The first TED has been great .
CA : Have you met anyone interesting ?
"RB : Well , the nice thing about TED is everybody &apos;s interesting ."
"I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn , because I had an apology to make to her ."
I &apos;d had dinner with her about two years ago and I &apos;d — she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn &apos;t get it off .
"And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman &apos;s big , massive , big wedding ring on my finger ."
"And , anyway , the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off ."
So — ( Laughter ) — so apologies to Goldie .
CA : That &apos;s pretty good .
"So , we &apos;re going to put up some slides of some of your companies here ."
You &apos;ve started one or two in your time .
"So , you know , Virgin Atlantic , Virgin Records — I guess it all started with a magazine called Student ."
"And then , yes , all these other ones as well . I mean , how do you do this ?"
"RB : I read all these sort of TED instructions : you must not talk about your own business , and this , and now you ask me ."
"So I suppose you &apos;re not going to be able to kick me off the stage , since you asked the question ."
( Laughter ) CA : It depends what the answer is though .
"RB : No , I mean , I think I learned early on that if you can run one company , you can really run any companies ."
"I mean , companies are all about finding the right people , inspiring those people , you know , drawing out the best in people ."
"And I just love learning and I &apos;m incredibly inquisitive and I love taking on , you know , the status quo and trying to turn it upside down ."
So I &apos;ve seen life as one long learning process .
"And if I see — you know , if I fly on somebody else &apos;s airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one , which it wasn &apos;t , 21 years ago , then I &apos;d think , well , you know , maybe I can create the kind of airline that I &apos;d like to fly on ."
"And so , you know , so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go ."
"CA : Well , that was a bizarre thing , because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy ."
"And in fact , in a way , it almost took down your empire at one point ."
"I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who , at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic , and his view was that you were trading , you know , the world &apos;s fourth biggest record company for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind ."
Why did you do that ?
"RB : Well , I think that there &apos;s a very thin dividing line between success and failure ."
"And I think if you start a business without financial backing , you &apos;re likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line ."
We had — we were being attacked by British Airways .
"They were trying to put our airline out of business , and they launched what &apos;s become known as the dirty tricks campaign ."
And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless I chipped in a chip .
"And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline , and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company , I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline ."
"CA : Post-Napster , you &apos;re looking like a bit of a genius , actually , for that as well ."
"RB : Yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move ."
"But , yeah , it was sad at the time , but we moved on ."
"CA : Now , you use the Virgin brand a lot and it seems like you &apos;re getting synergy from one thing to the other ."
What does the brand stand for in your head ?
"RB : Well , I like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a Virgin company , they — CA : They are quality , Richard . Come on now , everyone says quality . Spirit ?"
"RB : No , but I was going to move on this ."
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it .
"As I say , we go in and shake up other industries , and I think , you know , we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market ."
"CA : I mean , there are a few launches you &apos;ve done where the brand maybe hasn &apos;t worked quite as well ."
"I mean , Virgin Brides — what happened there ?"
( Laughter ) RB : We couldn &apos;t find any customers . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) CA : I was actually also curious why — I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch . You called it Mates .
"I mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the Virgin brand for that as well ?"
"Ain &apos;t virgin no longer , or something ."
"RB : Again , we may have had problems finding customers ."
"I mean , we had — often , when you launch a company and you get customer complaints , you know , you can deal with them ."
"But about three months after the launch of the condom company , I had a letter , a complaint , and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely ."
"But obviously , there wasn &apos;t a lot I could do about it ."
"And then six months later , or nine months after the problem had taken , I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if I &apos;d be godfather , which I became ."
"So , it all worked out well ."
CA : Really ? You should have brought a picture . That &apos;s wonderful .
RB : I should have .
"CA : So , just help us with some of the numbers ."
"I mean , what are the numbers on this ?"
"I mean , how big is the group overall ?"
How much — what &apos;s the total revenue ?
"RB : It &apos;s about 25 billion dollars now , in total ."
CA : And how many employees ?
"RB : About 55,000 ."
"CA : So , you &apos;ve been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that ."
What was that ? Was that real ?
"RB : Yeah . We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles , I think ."
"No , I mean , I think — CA : But is that your hair ?"
RB : No .
CA : What was that one ?
RB : Dropping in for tea .
CA : OK .
"( Laughter ) RB : Ah , that was quite fun . That was a wonderful car-boat in which — CA : Oh , that car that we — actually we — it was a TEDster event there , I think ."
"Is that — could you still pause on that one actually , for a minute ?"
"( Laughter ) RB : It &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?"
"CA : I mean , it is a tough job ."
"( Laughter ) When I first came to America , I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of — they have these different rules over here , it &apos;s very strange ."
"RB : I know , I have — the lawyers say you mustn &apos;t do things like that , but — CA : I mean , speaking of which , tell us about — RB : &quot; &quot; Pammy &quot; &quot; we launched , you know — mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola , and we launched a cola bottle called &quot; &quot; The Pammy &quot; &quot; and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson ."
"But the trouble is , it kept on tipping over , but — ( Laughter ) CA : Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps ?"
RB : Of course .
"CA : So , we &apos;ll just run a couple more pictures here . Virgin Brides . Very nice ."
"And , OK , so stop there . This was — you had some award I think ?"
"RB : Yeah , well , 25 years earlier , we &apos;d launched the Sex Pistols &apos; &quot; &quot; God Save The Queen , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d certainly never expected that 25 years later — that she &apos;d actually knight us ."
"But somehow , she must have had a forgetful memory , I think ."
"CA : Well , God saved her and you got your just reward ."
"Do you like to be called Sir Richard , or how ?"
RB : Nobody &apos;s ever called me Sir Richard .
"Occasionally in America , I hear people saying Sir Richard and think there &apos;s some Shakespearean play taking place ."
But nowhere else anyway .
CA : OK . So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...
"RB : No . I suppose if you &apos;re having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something , that might be worth using it ."
"CA : You know , it &apos;s not Richard Branson . It &apos;s Sir Richard Branson ."
RB : I &apos;ll go get the secretary to use it .
CA : OK . So let &apos;s look at the space thing .
"I think , with us , we &apos;ve got a video that shows what you &apos;re up to , and Virgin Galactic up in the air . ( Video ) So that &apos;s the Bert Rutan designed spaceship ?"
"RB : Yeah , it &apos;ll be ready in — well , ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months extensive testing ."
"And then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space ."
CA : So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed ?
"RB : Philippe has done the — yeah , quite a bit of it : the logos and he &apos;s building the space station in New Mexico ."
"And basically , he &apos;s just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye , so when you &apos;re in space , you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you ."
"And when you land , you &apos;ll be able to go back into this giant eye ."
But he &apos;s an absolute genius when it comes to design .
CA : But you didn &apos;t have him design the engine ?
"RB : Philippe is quite erratic , so I think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the engine , no ."
CA : He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago .
"RB : Yeah ? No , he is a — CA : Well , some people found it wonderful , some people found it completely bizarre ."
"But , I personally found it wonderful ."
"RB : He &apos;s a wonderful enthusiast , which is why I love him . But ..."
"CA : So , now , you &apos;ve always had this exploration bug in you ."
Have you ever regretted that ?
RB : Many times .
"I mean , I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we &apos;ve done in the past ."
"Well , I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters , so — and each time , I didn &apos;t expect to come home to tell the tale ."
"So in those moments , you certainly wonder what you &apos;re doing up there or — CA : What was the closest you got to — when did you think , this is it , I might be on my way out ?"
"RB : Well , I think the balloon adventures were — each one was , each one , actually , I think we came close ."
"And , I mean , first of all we — nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before , so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream , and we weren &apos;t quite sure , when a balloon actually got into the jet stream , whether it would actually survive the 200 , 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there ."
"And so , just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic , as we were pushing into the jet stream , this enormous balloon — the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour , the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off ."
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
"And we were just crossing every finger , praying that the balloon would hold together , which , fortunately , it did ."
"But the ends of all those balloon trips were , you know — something seemed to go wrong every time , and on that particular occasion , the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped , and left me holding on for dear life ."
"( Laughter ) CA : Did he tell you to jump , or he just said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m out of here ! &quot; &quot; and ..."
"RB : No , he told me jump , but once his weight had gone , the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ..."
CA : And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that .
"RB : Yeah . No , I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon , with my parachute , looking at the swirling clouds below , trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea , which — and it was a very , very , very lonely few moments ."
"But , anyway , we managed to survive it ."
CA : Did you jump ? Or it came down in the end ?
"RB : Well , I knew I had about half an hour &apos;s fuel left , and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped , I would only have a couple of minutes of life left ."
So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that I was making the right decision .
"And wrote some notes to my family . And then climbed back up again , looked down at those clouds again , climbed back into the capsule again ."
"And then finally , just thought , there &apos;s a better way ."
"I &apos;ve got , you know , this enormous balloon above me , it &apos;s the biggest parachute ever , why not use it ?"
"And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds , and about 50 feet , before I hit the sea , threw myself over ."
"And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me ."
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and — CA : What did you write to your family ?
"RB : Just what you would do in a situation like that : just I love you very much . And I &apos;d already written them a letter before going on this trip , which — just in case anything had happened ."
"But fortunately , they never had to use it ."
CA : Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics .
"The years — and until I stopped looking at the polls , you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere ."
"And cynics might say , you know , this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing ."
How much was the PR value part of this ?
"RB : Well , of course , the PR experts said that as an airline owner , the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats , and crashing into the seas ."
"( Laughter ) CA : They have a point , Richard ."
"RB : In fact , I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying , you know , come on , Richard , there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic ."
"( Laughter ) CA : To do all this , you must have been a genius from the get-go , right ?"
"RB : Well , I won &apos;t contradict that ."
"( Laughter ) CA : OK , this isn &apos;t exactly hardball . OK ."
Didn &apos;t — weren &apos;t you just terrible at school ?
RB : I was dyslexic . I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever .
I certainly would have failed IQ tests .
And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old .
"And if I — if I &apos;m not interested in something , I don &apos;t grasp it ."
"As somebody who &apos;s dyslexic , you also have some quite bizarre situations ."
"I mean , for instance , I &apos;ve had to — you know , I &apos;ve been running the largest group of private companies in Europe , but haven &apos;t been able to know the difference between net and gross ."
And so the board meetings have been fascinating .
"( Laughter ) And so , it &apos;s like , good news or bad news ?"
"And generally , the people would say , oh , well that &apos;s bad news ."
"CA : But just to clarify , the 25 billion dollars is gross , right ? That &apos;s gross ?"
"( Laughter ) RB : Well , I hope it &apos;s net actually , having — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;ve got it right ."
"CA : No , trust me , it &apos;s gross ."
"( Laughter ) RB : So , when I turned 50 , somebody took me outside the boardroom and said , &quot; &quot; Look Richard , here &apos;s a — let me draw on a diagram ."
"Here &apos;s a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net ."
"And that &apos;s the profits you &apos;ve got left over in this little net , everything else is eaten . &quot; &quot; And I finally worked it all out ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : But , I mean , at school — so as well as being , you know , doing pretty miserably academically , but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams ."
"So you were kind of a — you were a natural leader , but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then , or how would you ..."
"RB : Yeah , I think I was a bit of a maverick and — but I ... And I was , yeah , I was fortunately good at sport , and so at least I had something to excel at , at school ."
CA : And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life .
"I mean , there &apos;s the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field , aged four , and saying &quot; &quot; OK , walk home . &quot; &quot; Did this really happen ?"
"RB : She was , you know , she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age ."
"So she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be arrested for , such as pushing us out of the car , and telling us to find our own way to Granny &apos;s , about five miles before we actually got there ."
"And making us go on wonderful , long bike rides ."
And we were never allowed to watch television and the like .
CA : But is there a risk here ?
"I mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this dilemma about how you bring them up ."
"Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too coddled , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to raise a generation of privileged ..."
"RB : No , I think if you &apos;re bringing up kids , you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm ."
So I don &apos;t think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really .
"CA : You didn &apos;t turn out too bad , I have to say , I &apos;m ..."
"Your headmaster said to you — I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school — he said , you &apos;re either going to be a millionaire or go to prison , and I &apos;m not sure which ."
Which of those happened first ?
"( Laughter ) RB : Well , I &apos;ve done both . I think I went to prison first ."
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.
I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act .
"On the first occasion , for mentioning the word venereal disease in public , which — we had a center where we would help young people who had problems ."
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease .
And there &apos;s an ancient law that says you can &apos;t actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public .
"So the police knocked on the door , and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease ."
"We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots , but nobody came with VD any more ."
"So , we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested ."
"And then subsequently , &quot; &quot; Never Mind the Bollocks , Here &apos;s the Sex Pistols , &quot; &quot; the word bollocks , the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols &apos; album ."
"And John Mortimer , the playwright , defended us ."
And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks .
"And so I rang up Nottingham University , and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Look , bollocks is not a — has nothing to do with balls whatsoever ."
"It &apos;s actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he went , &quot; &quot; Furthermore , I &apos;m a priest myself . &quot; &quot; And so I said , &quot; &quot; Would you mind coming to the court ? &quot; &quot; And he said he &apos;d be delighted . And I said — and he said , &quot; &quot; Would you like me to wear my dog collar ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , definitely . Please . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) CA : That &apos;s great ."
"RB : So our key witness argued that it was actually &quot; Never Mind the Priest , Here &apos;s the Sex Pistols . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And the judge found us — reluctantly found us not guilty , so ... ( Laughter )"
CA : That is outrageous .
"( Applause ) So seriously , is there a dark side ?"
"A lot of people would say there &apos;s no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back , you know , doing some ugly things ."
You &apos;ve been accused of being ruthless .
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone .
Is any of it true ? Is there an element of truth in it ?
"RB : I don &apos;t actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works ."
"I think if you treat people well , people will come back and come back for more ."
And I think all you have in life is your reputation and it &apos;s a very small world .
"And I actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well , and I like to think that &apos;s how we run Virgin ."
"CA : And what about the people who love you and who see you spending — you keep getting caught up in these new projects , but it almost feels like you &apos;re addicted to launching new stuff ."
"You get excited by an idea and , kapow !"
"I mean , do you think about life balance ?"
How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ?
"RB : I also believe that being a father &apos;s incredibly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on holiday , I go on holiday with them ."
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .
"Yes , I &apos;ll , you know , be in touch . We &apos;re very lucky , we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can — so I can take them there and we can bring friends , and we can play together , but I can also keep in touch with what &apos;s going on ."
CA : You started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy .
What is that ?
RB : Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works .
"You know , the alternative , communism , has not worked ."
"But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people , and therefore extreme responsibility , I think , goes with that wealth ."
"And I think it &apos;s important that the individuals , who are in that fortunate position , do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats , and bigger and bigger cars , but , you know , use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world ."
"CA : And what are the issues that you worry about most , care most about , want to turn your resources toward ?"
"RB : Well , there &apos;s — I mean there &apos;s a lot of issues ."
"I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into , A , trying to come up with alternative fuels and , B , you know , we just launched this prize , which is really a prize in case we don &apos;t get an answer on alternative fuels , in case we don &apos;t actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly , and in case we go through the tipping point ."
We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the Earth &apos;s atmosphere .
"And we just — you know , there weren &apos;t really people working on that before , so we wanted people to try to — all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that , and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earth &apos;s atmosphere as well ."
"And actually , we &apos;ve had about 15,000 people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go ."
"And so we only need one , so we &apos;re hopeful ."
CA : And you &apos;re also working in Africa on a couple of projects ?
"RB : Yes , I mean , we &apos;ve got — we &apos;re setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word ."
"We &apos;re trying to — maybe we &apos;ll change it — but anyway , it &apos;s a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that &apos;s going on in Africa , all the different social problems in Africa , and try to look at best practices ."
"So , for instance , there &apos;s a doctor in Africa that &apos;s found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks , when she &apos;s pregnant , that the baby will not have HIV when it &apos;s born ."
And so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important .
"CA : The war room sounds , it sounds powerful and dramatic ."
"And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about — I mean , they &apos;re used to having an idea , getting stuff done , and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world ."
"Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say , we &apos;ve got to fix this problem and we can do it , I &apos;ve got all these billions of dollars , you know , da , da , da — here &apos;s the big idea . And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it . Do you worry about that ?"
"RB : Well , first of all , on this particular situation , we &apos;re actually — we &apos;re working with the government on it ."
"I mean , Thabo Mbeki &apos;s had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related , but this is a way , I think , of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him , it &apos;s a way of working with him , with his government ."
"It &apos;s important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help , they don &apos;t just go in there and then leave after a few years ."
It &apos;s got to be consistent .
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .
"For instance , we &apos;re setting up clinics in Africa where we &apos;re going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs , free TB treatment and free malaria treatment ."
"But we &apos;re also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics , so that people pay for some other aspects ."
"CA : I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself , or Bill Gates , or whatever , that this is really being — it &apos;s almost driven by some sort of desire again , you know , for the right image , for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct ."
What would you say to them ?
"RB : Well , I think that everybody — people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and I think that , you know , when I &apos;m on me deathbed , I will want to feel that I &apos;ve made a difference to other people &apos;s lives ."
"And that may be a selfish thing to think , but it &apos;s the way I &apos;ve been brought up ."
"I think if I &apos;m in a position to radically change other people &apos;s lives for the better , I should do so ."
CA : How old are you ?
RB : I &apos;m 56 .
"CA : I mean , the psychologist Erik Erikson says that — as I understand him and I &apos;m a total amateur — but that during 30s , 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that &apos;s where they get their fulfillment ."
"50s , 60s , the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy ."
"I mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the growth phases , you &apos;re still doing these incredible new plans ."
"How much do you think about legacy , and what would you like your legacy to be ?"
RB : I don &apos;t think I think too much about legacy .
"I mean , I like to — you know , my grandmother lived to 101 , so hopefully I &apos;ve got another 30 or 40 years to go ."
"No , I just want to live life to its full ."
"You know , if I can make a difference , I hope to be able to make a difference ."
"And I think one of the positive things at the moment is you &apos;ve got Sergey and Larry from Google , for instance , who are good friends ."
"And , thank God , you &apos;ve got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth ."
"If they had that kind of wealth and they didn &apos;t care about the world , it would be very worrying ."
And you know they &apos;re going to make a hell of a difference to the world .
And I think it &apos;s important that people in that kind of position do make a difference .
"CA : Well , Richard , when I was starting off in business , I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of — I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding ."
"And you actually did inspire me . I looked at you , I thought , well , he &apos;s made it . Maybe there is a different way ."
"So I would like to thank you for that inspiration , and for coming to TED today . Thank you ."
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world .
"And it &apos;s not a trip that requires light-years of travel , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s defined by light ."
So it &apos;s a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs .
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .
But mostly I &apos;m entranced by it .
"Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible , when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays , I &apos;ve been a bioluminescence junky ."
"But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task ."
I needed some way to share the experience directly .
And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called Deep Rover .
"This next video clip , you &apos;re going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence ."
And the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
"( Video ) Narrator : In front of the sub , a mess screen will come into contact with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea ."
"With the sub &apos;s lights switched off , it is possible to see their bioluminescence — the light produced when they collide with the mesh ."
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .
Edith Widder : So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible .
"But just to try to prove that fact to you , I &apos;ve brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration ."
"( Laughter ) So , if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible , I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it ."
"And you &apos;ll note there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , either because they &apos;re dead — ( Laughter ) or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like ."
( Gasps ) Oops . Sorry .
( Laughter ) I spend most of my time working in the dark ; I &apos;m used to that .
Okay .
"So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate , a single-celled alga ."
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ?
"Well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators ."
The flash is like a scream for help .
"It &apos;s what &apos;s known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm , and just like the alarm on your car or your house , it &apos;s meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder , thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away ."
"There &apos;s a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish ."
It &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
"It &apos;s got a lot of other light organs you can &apos;t see , but you &apos;ll see in here in a minute ."
"So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime , because the top speed of this fish is one knot , which was the top speed of the submersible ."
"But it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up ."
It &apos;s unbelievable .
The light organs under the eyes are flashing .
That chin barbel is flashing .
"It &apos;s got light organs on its belly that are flashing , fin lights ."
It &apos;s a scream for help ; it &apos;s meant to attract attention .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
And you normally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets .
There &apos;s other ways you can defend yourself with light .
"For example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud ."
This blinds or distracts the predator .
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .
"Now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig &apos;s head with wings — ( Laughter ) but if it &apos;s attacked , it puts out a barrage of light — in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes ."
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
So there &apos;s a lot of animals in the open ocean — most of them that make light .
"And we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why ."
"They use it for finding food , for attracting mates , for defending against predators ."
"But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean , that &apos;s where things get really strange ."
"And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in &quot; &quot; Avatar , &quot; &quot; but you don &apos;t have to travel to Pandora to see them ."
They &apos;re things like this .
"This is a golden coral , a bush ."
It grows very slowly .
"In fact , it &apos;s thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old , which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed ."
The other reason is this amazing bush glows .
"So if you brush up against it , any place you brushed against it , you get this twinkling blue-green light that &apos;s just breathtaking ."
And you see things like this .
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book — just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
And these are flytrap anemones .
"Now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles ."
"But if you keep poking it , it starts to produce light ."
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
"It produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense ."
There are starfish that can make light .
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms .
"This looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal ."
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock .
"So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here ."
"But if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue ."
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
( Laughter ) But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a sea pen .
It &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
It &apos;s a green saber of light .
"And like the one you just saw , it can produce these as bands of light ."
"So if I squeeze the base , the bands go from base to tip ."
"If I squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base ."
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle ?
( Gasps ) I &apos;d be very interested in your theories about what that &apos;s about .
"( Laughter ) So there &apos;s a language of light in the deep ocean , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re imitating a lot of these displays ."
This is an optical lure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
It &apos;s just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays .
"And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s unobtrusive ."
So I just want to show you some of the responses we &apos;ve elicited from animals in the deep sea .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And what you &apos;re seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of — like the cockroaches of the ocean — there are isopods all over it .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
"And when it starts flashing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the LEDs that &apos;s flashing very fast ."
"But as soon as it starts to flash — and it &apos;s going to look big , because it blooms on the camera — I want you to look right here ."
There &apos;s something small there that responds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
"It looks like a little of string pearls basically — in fact , three strings of pearls ."
And this was very consistent .
"This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet ."
"We basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking ."
And I think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
"But the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it ."
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
"Personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy ."
"( Laughter ) And then finally , I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world &apos;s first deep-sea webcam , which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year ."
We &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
"This is going to be a glowing source first , which is like bioluminescent bacteria ."
And it is an optical cue that there &apos;s carrion on the bottom of the ocean .
"So this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark ."
"And I can &apos;t claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there &apos;s bait right there ."
"But if it had been following the odor plume , it would have come in from the other direction ."
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
That &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
"Okay , so this next one is from the webcam , and it &apos;s going to be this pinwheel display ."
And this is a burglar alarm .
"And that was a Humboldt squid , a juvenile Humboldt squid , about three feet long ."
"This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon ."
"But if it &apos;s a burglar alarm , you wouldn &apos;t expect it to attack the jellyfish directly ."
It &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
This guy is a little more contemplative .
"&quot; &quot; Hey , wait a minute ."
There &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
"And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more , and thinks , &quot; Maybe if I come in from a different angle . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Nope .
"So we are starting to get a handle on this , but only just the beginnings ."
We need more eyes on the process .
"So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible , by all means , climb in and take the plunge ."
"This is something that should be on everybody &apos;s bucket list , because we live on an ocean planet ."
"More than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean ."
"It &apos;s a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures , alien life forms that you don &apos;t have to travel to another planet to see ."
"But if you do take the plunge , please remember to turn out the lights ."
"But I warn you , it &apos;s addictive ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s been great , hasn &apos;t it ?"
I &apos;ve been blown away by the whole thing .
"In fact , I &apos;m leaving ."
( Laughter ) There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about .
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here .
Just the variety of it and the range of it .
I have an interest in education .
"Actually , what I find is everybody has an interest in education ."
Don &apos;t you ?
"If you &apos;re at a dinner party , and you say you work in education — Actually , you &apos;re not often at dinner parties , frankly ."
"( Laughter ) If you work in education , you &apos;re not asked . ( Laughter )"
"And you &apos;re never asked back , curiously . That &apos;s strange to me ."
"But if you ask about their education , they pin you to the wall ."
"Because it &apos;s one of those things that goes deep with people , am I right ?"
"So I have a big interest in education , and I think we all do ."
"I mean , Sirena last night was a marvel , wasn &apos;t she ?"
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent .
"And my contention is , all kids have tremendous talents ."
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"That was it , by the way ."
"Well , I was born ... no . ( Laughter )"
The teacher was fascinated .
"But James got the part of Joseph , which we were thrilled about ."
We considered this to be one of the lead parts .
"We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts : &quot; &quot; James Robinson IS Joseph ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He didn &apos;t have to speak , but you know the bit where the three kings come in ?"
This really happened .
"If they don &apos;t know , they &apos;ll have a go ."
Am I right ? They &apos;re not frightened of being wrong .
I don &apos;t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative .
"What we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original — if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong ."
"And by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity ."
They have become frightened of being wrong .
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities .
"Picasso once said this , he said that all children are born artists ."
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up .
"I believe this passionately , that we don &apos;t grow into creativity , we grow out of it ."
"Or rather , we get educated out of it ."
So why is this ?
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago .
"In fact , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles ."
Are you struck by a new thought ? I was .
"You don &apos;t think of Shakespeare having a father , do you ?"
"Do you ? Because you don &apos;t think of Shakespeare being a child , do you ?"
Shakespeare being seven ?
I never thought of it .
"I mean , he was seven at some point ."
"He was in somebody &apos;s English class , wasn &apos;t he ?"
&quot; Must try harder . &quot; ( Laughter )
&quot; It &apos;s confusing everybody . &quot; ( Laughter )
"Anyway , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles , and I just want to say a word about the transition ."
My son didn &apos;t want to come .
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 21 now , my daughter &apos;s 16 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to Los Angeles .
"He loved it , but he had a girlfriend in England ."
"This was the love of his life , Sarah ."
He &apos;d known her for a month .
"( Laughter ) Mind you , they &apos;d had their fourth anniversary , because it &apos;s a long time when you &apos;re 16 ."
Every one . Doesn &apos;t matter where you go .
"You &apos;d think it would be otherwise , but it isn &apos;t ."
"At the top are mathematics and languages , then the humanities , and at the bottom are the arts ."
Everywhere on Earth .
"And in pretty much every system too , there &apos;s a hierarchy within the arts ."
There isn &apos;t an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics . Why ?
Why not ? I think this is rather important .
"We all have bodies , don &apos;t we ? Did I miss a meeting ?"
Isn &apos;t it ?
They &apos;re the people who come out the top .
"And I used to be one , so there ."
"( Laughter ) And I like university professors , but you know , we shouldn &apos;t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement ."
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
"But they &apos;re rather curious , and I say this out of affection for them ."
"There &apos;s something curious about professors in my experience — not all of them , but typically , they live in their heads ."
"They &apos;re disembodied , you know , in a kind of literal way ."
They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads .
It &apos;s a way of getting their head to meetings .
"And there , you will see it ."
"Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably , off the beat ."
Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability .
"Around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century ."
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
"Number one , that the most useful subjects for work are at the top ."
"Don &apos;t do music , you &apos;re not going to be a musician ; don &apos;t do art , you won &apos;t be an artist ."
The whole world is engulfed in a revolution .
"And the second is academic ability , which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence , because the universities designed the system in their image ."
"If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance ."
"In the next 30 years , according to UNESCO , more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history ."
"More people , and it &apos;s the combination of all the things we &apos;ve talked about — technology and its transformation effect on work , and demography and the huge explosion in population ."
Isn &apos;t that true ?
"If you didn &apos;t have a job , it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one ."
We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence .
"We think in abstract terms , we think in movement ."
"If you look at the interactions of a human brain , as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations , intelligence is wonderfully interactive ."
The brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
"In fact , creativity — which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value — more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things ."
"By the way , there &apos;s a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum ."
"Following off from Helen yesterday , this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking ."
"Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?"
"There &apos;s a raft of research , but I know it from my personal life ."
"If my wife is cooking a meal at home — which is not often , thankfully ."
"If I &apos;m cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the hook , if she comes in I get annoyed ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; Terry , please , I &apos;m trying to fry an egg in here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; Give me a break . &quot; ( Laughter )"
"Actually , do you know that old philosophical thing , if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it , did it happen ?"
Remember that old chestnut ?
"I saw a great t-shirt recently , which said , &quot; &quot; If a man speaks his mind in a forest , and no woman hears him , is he still wrong ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the third thing about intelligence is , it &apos;s distinct ."
"I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet , as you can see ."
It wasn &apos;t an available condition .
( Laughter ) People weren &apos;t aware they could have that . ( Laughter )
"Anyway , she went to see this specialist ."
"So , this oak-paneled room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school ."
"Because she was disturbing people ; her homework was always late ; and so on , little kid of eight ."
"In the end , the doctor went and sat next to Gillian , and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve listened to all these things your mother &apos;s told me , I need to speak to her privately ."
"But as they went out of the room , he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk ."
"And when they got out , he said to her mother , &quot; &quot; Just stand and watch her . &quot; &quot; And the minute they left the room , she was on her feet , moving to the music ."
"And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said , &quot; &quot; Mrs. Lynne , Gillian isn &apos;t sick ; she &apos;s a dancer ."
"Take her to a dance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me .
People who couldn &apos;t sit still .
People who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Who had to move to think .
"They did ballet , they did tap , jazz ; they did modern ; they did contemporary ."
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School ; she became a soloist ; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet .
Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down .
( Applause ) What I think it comes to is this : Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson .
Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth : for a particular commodity .
"And for the future , it won &apos;t serve us ."
"There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk , who said , &quot; &quot; If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth , within 50 years all life on Earth would end ."
"If all human beings disappeared from the Earth , within 50 years all forms of life would flourish . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s right ."
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination .
We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we &apos;ve talked about .
And the only way we &apos;ll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are .
And our job is to help them make something of it .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
There are a few things that all of us need .
We all need air to breathe .
We need clean water to drink .
We need food to eat . We need shelter and love .
"You know . Love is great , too ."
And we all need a safe place to pee .
( Laughter ) Yeah ?
"As a trans person who doesn &apos;t fit neatly into the gender binary , if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate , the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall , gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places ."
"( Applause ) Trans people and trans issues , they &apos;ve been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately ."
"And this is a great and necessary thing , but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals , most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous , and probably don &apos;t have to worry that much anymore about where they &apos;re going to pee in between classes at their community college , or where they &apos;re going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school ."
Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis .
Public bathrooms .
"They &apos;ve been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember , first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine-appearing , predominantly estrogen-based organism ."
"( Laughter ) Now , today as a trans person , public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed ."
I &apos;ve often been verbally attacked behind their doors .
I &apos;ve been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up .
"I &apos;ve been stared at , screamed at , whispered about , and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady &apos;s purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection ."
"( Laughter ) And I know what some of you are thinking , and you &apos;re mostly right ."
I can and do just use the men &apos;s room most of the time these days .
"But that doesn &apos;t solve my change room dilemmas , does it ?"
And I shouldn &apos;t have to use the men &apos;s room because I &apos;m not a man .
I &apos;m a trans person .
And now we &apos;ve got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills .
Have you heard about these ?
They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth .
"And if these politicians ever get their way , in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston , Texas , or Ottawa , well then , using the men &apos;s room will not be a legal option for me either ."
"And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table , I can &apos;t help but wonder , you know , just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these . Right ?"
Panty checks ?
Really .
Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools ?
There &apos;s no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway .
They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia .
They don &apos;t make anyone safer .
But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us .
"And meanwhile , our trans children suffer ."
"They drop out of school , or they opt out of life altogether ."
"Trans people , especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms , but also universities , hospitals , libraries ."
Don &apos;t even get me started on how they treat us in airports .
"If we don &apos;t move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone , then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places ."
"We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes , which I do not ."
I never have .
And this starts very early .
I know a little girl . She &apos;s the daughter of a friend of mine .
She &apos;s a self-identified tomboy .
"I &apos;m talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars , the whole nine yards ."
One time I asked her what her favorite color was .
"She told me , &quot; &quot; Camouflage . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that awesome little kid , she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls &apos; bathroom ."
And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys &apos; bathroom .
"And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party , and I mean , who can resist that red juice , right ? It &apos;s so good ."
And she couldn &apos;t hold her pee any longer .
Her and her classmates were four years old .
They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms .
She was four years old .
She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her .
"She &apos;d already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem , and that problem started with her and was hers alone ."
"So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter , and I did ."
"I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older , but I couldn &apos;t ."
"So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened , asked her to tell me how it made her feel ."
"So I told her that she wasn &apos;t alone and that it wasn &apos;t right what had happened to her , and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before ."
"I said yes , I had , but not for a really long time ."
"( Laughter ) Which of course was a lie , because you know how you hit , like , 42 or 43 , and sometimes you just , I don &apos;t know , you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze , when you &apos;re running upstairs , or you &apos;re stretching ."
Don &apos;t lie .
It happens . Right ?
"She doesn &apos;t need to know that , I figure ."
"( Laughter ) I told her , when you get older , your bladder is going to grow bigger , too ."
"When you get old like me , you &apos;re going to be able to hold your pee for way longer , I promised her ."
&quot; Until you can get home ? &quot;
she asked me .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , until you can get home . &quot; &quot; She seemed to take some comfort in that ."
"So let &apos;s just build some single stall , gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes ."
This we can do .
So let &apos;s just do it .
"If you can &apos;t bring yourself to care enough about people like me , then what about women and girls with body image issues ?"
What about anyone with body image stuff going on ?
"What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates , whose voice still hasn &apos;t dropped yet ? Hey ?"
"Oh , grade eight , what a cruel master you can be ."
Right ?
What about people with anxiety issues ?
What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there ?
"What about folks with bodies who , for whatever reason , don &apos;t fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like ?"
"How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers , and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise ?"
Would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities ?
"We can &apos;t change transphobic minds overnight , but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us ."
Thank you for listening .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are embedded in a very large cosmos , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at either of those scales , and that &apos;s because our brains haven &apos;t evolved to understand the world at that scale ."
"Instead , we &apos;re trapped on this very thin slice of perception right in the middle ."
"But it gets strange , because even at that slice of reality that we call home , we &apos;re not seeing most of the action that &apos;s going on ."
So take the colors of our world .
"This is light waves , electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects and it hits specialized receptors in the back of our eyes ."
But we &apos;re not seeing all the waves out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 trillionth of what &apos;s out there ."
"So you have radio waves and microwaves and X-rays and gamma rays passing through your body right now and you &apos;re completely unaware of it , because you don &apos;t come with the proper biological receptors for picking it up ."
"There are thousands of cell phone conversations passing through you right now , and you &apos;re utterly blind to it ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are inherently unseeable ."
"Snakes include some infrared in their reality , and honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world , and of course we build machines in the dashboards of our cars to pick up on signals in the radio frequency range , and we built machines in hospitals to pick up on the X-ray range ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at least not yet , because you don &apos;t come equipped with the proper sensors ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology , and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that &apos;s out there ."
"Instead , our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world ."
"Now , across the animal kingdom , different animals pick up on different parts of reality ."
"So in the blind and deaf world of the tick , the important signals are temperature and butyric acid ; in the world of the black ghost knifefish , its sensory world is lavishly colored by electrical fields ; and for the echolocating bat , its reality is constructed out of air compression waves ."
"That &apos;s the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"It &apos;s called the umwelt , which is the German word for the surrounding world ."
"Now , presumably , every animal assumes that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something beyond what we can sense ."
"Instead , what we all do is we accept reality as it &apos;s presented to us ."
Let &apos;s do a consciousness-raiser on this .
Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog .
Your whole world is about smelling .
"You &apos;ve got a long snout that has 200 million scent receptors in it , and you have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules , and your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air ."
Everything is about smell for you .
"So one day , you stop in your tracks with a revelation ."
"You look at your human owner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the pitiful , impoverished nose of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air ?
"How can you not know that there &apos;s a cat 100 yards away , or that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re humans , we &apos;ve never experienced that world of smell , so we don &apos;t miss it , because we are firmly settled into our umwelt ."
"But the question is , do we have to be stuck there ?"
"So as a neuroscientist , I &apos;m interested in the way that technology might expand our umwelt , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology , because there are hundreds of thousands of people walking around with artificial hearing and artificial vision ."
"So the way this works is , you take a microphone and you digitize the signal , and you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear ."
"Or , with the retinal implant , you take a camera and you digitize the signal , and then you plug an electrode grid directly into the optic nerve ."
"And as recently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn &apos;t work ."
"Why ? It &apos;s because these technologies speak the language of Silicon Valley , and it &apos;s not exactly the same dialect as our natural biological sense organs ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain figures out how to use the signals just fine .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big secret : Your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this ."
Your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull .
"All it ever sees are electrochemical signals that come in along different data cables , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
"Now , amazingly , the brain is really good at taking in these signals and extracting patterns and assigning meaning , so that it takes this inner cosmos and puts together a story of this , your subjective world ."
"But here &apos;s the key point : Your brain doesn &apos;t know , and it doesn &apos;t care , where it gets the data from ."
"Whatever information comes in , it just figures out what to do with it ."
And this is a very efficient kind of machine .
"It &apos;s essentially a general purpose computing device , and it just takes in everything and figures out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , frees up Mother Nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels ."
"So I call this the P.H. model of evolution , and I don &apos;t want to get too technical here , but P.H. stands for Potato Head , and I use this name to emphasize that all these sensors that we know and love , like our eyes and our ears and our fingertips , these are merely peripheral plug-and-play devices : You stick them in , and you &apos;re good to go ."
The brain figures out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the animal kingdom , you find lots of peripheral devices ."
"So snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared , and the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors , and the star-nosed mole has this appendage with 22 fingers on it with which it feels around and constructs a 3D model of the world , and many birds have magnetite so they can orient to the magnetic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to continually redesign the brain .
"Instead , with the principles of brain operation established , all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals ."
Okay . So what this means is this : The lesson that surfaces is that there &apos;s nothing really special or fundamental about the biology that we come to the table with .
It &apos;s just what we have inherited from a complex road of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to stick with , and our best proof of principle of this comes from what &apos;s called sensory substitution ."
"And that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels , and the brain just figures out what to do with it ."
"Now , that might sound speculative , but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal Nature in 1969 ."
"So if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera , you &apos;re feeling that in your back , and amazingly , blind people got pretty good at being able to determine what was in front of the camera just by feeling it in the small of their back ."
"Now , there have been many modern incarnations of this ."
"And it doesn &apos;t have to be through the ears : this system uses an electrotactile grid on the forehead , so whatever &apos;s in front of the video feed , you &apos;re feeling it on your forehead ."
Why the forehead ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most modern incarnation is called the brainport , and this is a little electrogrid that sits on your tongue , and the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals , and blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket , or they can navigate complex obstacle courses ."
They can come to see through their tongue .
"Now , that sounds completely insane , right ?"
"But remember , all vision ever is is electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain ."
Your brain doesn &apos;t know where the signals come from .
It just figures out what to do with them .
And here is what we wanted to do : we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said .
"And we wanted to do this , given the power and ubiquity of portable computing , we wanted to make sure that this would run on cell phones and tablets , and also we wanted to make this a wearable , something that you could wear under your clothing ."
So here &apos;s the concept .
"So as I &apos;m speaking , my sound is getting captured by the tablet , and then it &apos;s getting mapped onto a vest that &apos;s covered in vibratory motors , just like the motors in your cell phone . So as I &apos;m speaking ,"
the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest .
"Now , this is not just conceptual : this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth , and I &apos;m wearing the vest right now ."
So as I &apos;m speaking — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration .
I &apos;m feeling the sonic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been testing this with deaf people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feeling , they can start understanding the language of the vest ."
So this is Jonathan . He &apos;s 37 years old . He has a master &apos;s degree .
"He was born profoundly deaf , which means that there &apos;s a part of his umwelt that &apos;s unavailable to him ."
"So we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fifth day ."
Scott Novich : You .
"David Eagleman : So Scott says a word , Jonathan feels it on the vest , and he writes it on the board ."
SN : Where . Where .
DE : Jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
SN : Touch . Touch .
"DE : Now , he &apos;s not doing this — ( Applause ) — Jonathan is not doing this consciously , because the patterns are too complicated , but his brain is starting to unlock the pattern that allows it to figure out what the data mean , and our expectation is that , after wearing this for about three months , he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing in the same way that when a blind person passes a finger over braille , the meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all ."
"Now , this technology has the potential to be a game-changer , because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant , and that requires an invasive surgery ."
"And this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a cochlear implant , which opens up this technology globally , even for the poorest countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sensory addition ."
"How could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense , to expand the human umvelt ?"
"For example , could we feed real-time data from the Internet directly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they develop a direct perceptual experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the lab .
A subject is feeling a real-time streaming feed from the Net of data for five seconds .
"Then , two buttons appear , and he has to make a choice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He makes a choice , and he gets feedback after one second ."
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re feeding is real-time data from the stock market , and he &apos;s making buy and sell decisions ."
( Laughter ) And the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re seeing is , can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have , after several weeks , a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll report on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : During the talks this morning , we &apos;ve been automatically scraping Twitter for the TED2015 hashtag , and we &apos;ve been doing an automated sentiment analysis , which means , are people using positive words or negative words or neutral ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feeling this , and so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re loving this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a bigger experience than a human can normally have .
We &apos;re also expanding the umvelt of pilots .
"So in this case , the vest is streaming nine different measures from this quadcopter , so pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading , and that improves this pilot &apos;s ability to fly it ."
"It &apos;s essentially like he &apos;s extending his skin up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion .
"Just imagine an astronaut being able to feel the overall health of the International Space Station , or , for that matter , having you feel the invisible states of your own health , like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome , or having 360-degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet ."
"So the key is this : As we move into the future , we &apos;re going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices ."
"We no longer have to wait for Mother Nature &apos;s sensory gifts on her timescales , but instead , like any good parent , she &apos;s given us the tools that we need to go out and define our own trajectory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Can you feel it ? DE : Yeah .
"Actually , this was the first time I felt applause on the vest ."
It &apos;s nice . It &apos;s like a massage . ( Laughter ) CA : Twitter &apos;s going crazy . Twitter &apos;s going mad .
So that stock market experiment .
"DE : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to write to NIH anymore ."
"CA : Well look , just to be skeptical for a minute , I mean , this is amazing , but isn &apos;t most of the evidence so far that sensory substitution works , not necessarily that sensory addition works ?"
"I mean , isn &apos;t it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue because the visual cortex is still there , ready to process , and that that is needed as part of it ?"
DE : That &apos;s a great question . We actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in .
"The general story , though , is that it &apos;s extraordinarily flexible ."
"So when a person goes blind , what we used to call their visual cortex gets taken over by other things , by touch , by hearing , by vocabulary ."
So what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one-trick pony .
It just runs certain kinds of computations on things .
"And when we look around at things like braille , for example , people are getting information through bumps on their fingers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a theoretical limit that we know the edge of .
"CA : If this checks out , you &apos;re going to be deluged ."
There are so many possible applications for this .
"Are you ready for this ? What are you most excited about , the direction it might go ?"
"DE : I mean , I think there &apos;s a lot of applications here ."
"The key is this : Our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges , but they &apos;re really bad at what our world has become , which is screens with lots and lots of data ."
We have to crawl that with our attentional systems .
"So this is a way of just feeling the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re standing around ."
"So I think heavy machinery , safety , feeling the state of a factory , of your equipment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"CA : David Eagleman , that was one mind-blowing talk . Thank you very much ."
"DE : Thank you , Chris . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m going to talk about a failure of intuition that many of us suffer from .
It &apos;s really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger .
"I &apos;m going to describe a scenario that I think is both terrifying and likely to occur , and that &apos;s not a good combination , as it turns out ."
"And yet rather than be scared , most of you will feel that what I &apos;m talking about is kind of cool ."
I &apos;m going to describe how the gains we make in artificial intelligence could ultimately destroy us .
And that response is part of the problem .
OK ? That response should worry you .
"And if I were to convince you in this talk that we were likely to suffer a global famine , either because of climate change or some other catastrophe , and that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are very likely to live like this , you wouldn &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; Interesting ."
I like this TED Talk . &quot; &quot; Famine isn &apos;t fun .
"I am unable to marshal this response , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we stand before two doors .
"Behind door number one , we stop making progress in building intelligent machines ."
Our computer hardware and software just stops getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to consider why this might happen .
"I mean , given how valuable intelligence and automation are , we will continue to improve our technology if we are at all able to ."
What could stop us from doing this ?
A full-scale nuclear war ?
A global pandemic ?
An asteroid impact ?
Justin Bieber becoming president of the United States ?
"( Laughter ) The point is , something would have to destroy civilization as we know it ."
"You have to imagine how bad it would have to be to prevent us from making improvements in our technology permanently , generation after generation ."
"Now , this is often caricatured , as I have here , as a fear that armies of malicious robots will attack us ."
But that isn &apos;t the most likely scenario .
It &apos;s not that our machines will become spontaneously malevolent .
Just think about how we relate to ants .
We don &apos;t hate them .
We don &apos;t go out of our way to harm them .
"In fact , sometimes we take pains not to harm them ."
We step over them on the sidewalk .
"But whenever their presence seriously conflicts with one of our goals , let &apos;s say when constructing a building like this one , we annihilate them without a qualm ."
"The concern is that we will one day build machines that , whether they &apos;re conscious or not , could treat us with similar disregard ."
"Now , I suspect this seems far-fetched to many of you ."
But then you must find something wrong with one of the following assumptions .
And there are only three of them .
Intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems .
"Actually , this is a little bit more than an assumption ."
"We have already built narrow intelligence into our machines , and many of these machines perform at a level of superhuman intelligence already ."
"And we know that mere matter can give rise to what is called &quot; &quot; general intelligence , &quot; &quot; an ability to think flexibly across multiple domains , because our brains have managed it . Right ?"
"I mean , there &apos;s just atoms in here , and as long as we continue to build systems of atoms that display more and more intelligent behavior , we will eventually , unless we are interrupted , we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines ."
"It &apos;s crucial to realize that the rate of progress doesn &apos;t matter , because any progress is enough to get us into the end zone ."
We don &apos;t need Moore &apos;s law to continue . We don &apos;t need exponential progress .
We just need to keep going .
The second assumption is that we will keep going .
We will continue to improve our intelligent machines .
It is our most valuable resource .
So we want to do this .
We have problems that we desperately need to solve .
We want to cure diseases like Alzheimer &apos;s and cancer .
We want to understand economic systems . We want to improve our climate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"The train is already out of the station , and there &apos;s no brake to pull ."
"Finally , we don &apos;t stand on a peak of intelligence , or anywhere near it , likely ."
And this really is the crucial insight .
"This is what makes our situation so precarious , and this is what makes our intuitions about risk so unreliable ."
"Now , just consider the smartest person who has ever lived ."
On almost everyone &apos;s shortlist here is John von Neumann .
"I mean , the impression that von Neumann made on the people around him , and this included the greatest mathematicians and physicists of his time , is fairly well-documented ."
"If only half the stories about him are half true , there &apos;s no question he &apos;s one of the smartest people who has ever lived ."
So consider the spectrum of intelligence .
Here we have John von Neumann .
And then we have you and me .
"( Laughter ) Sorry , a chicken . ( Laughter )"
There &apos;s no reason for me to make this talk more depressing than it needs to be . ( Laughter )
And it &apos;s important to recognize that this is true by virtue of speed alone .
Right ? So imagine if we just built a superintelligent AI that was no smarter than your average team of researchers at Stanford or MIT .
"So you set it running for a week , and it will perform 20,000 years of human-level intellectual work , week after week after week ."
"The other thing that &apos;s worrying , frankly , is that , imagine the best case scenario ."
It &apos;s as though we &apos;ve been handed an oracle that behaves exactly as intended .
"Well , this machine would be the perfect labor-saving device ."
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human drudgery .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most intellectual work .
So what would apes like ourselves do in this circumstance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be free to play Frisbee and give each other massages ."
"Add some LSD and some questionable wardrobe choices , and the whole world could be like Burning Man ."
It seems likely that we would witness a level of wealth inequality and unemployment that we have never seen before .
And what would the Russians or the Chinese do if they heard that some company in Silicon Valley was about to deploy a superintelligent AI ?
"This machine would be capable of waging war , whether terrestrial or cyber , with unprecedented power ."
This is a winner-take-all scenario .
So it seems that even mere rumors of this kind of breakthrough could cause our species to go berserk .
"Now , one of the most frightening things , in my view , at this moment , are the kinds of things that AI researchers say when they want to be reassuring ."
And the most common reason we &apos;re told not to worry is time .
"This is all a long way off , don &apos;t you know ."
This is probably 50 or 100 years away .
"If intelligence is just a matter of information processing , and we continue to improve our machines , we will produce some form of superintelligence ."
And we have no idea how long it will take us to create the conditions to do that safely .
We have no idea how long it will take us to create the conditions to do that safely .
"And if you haven &apos;t noticed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is 50 years in months .
This is how long we &apos;ve had the iPhone .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The Simpsons &quot; &quot; has been on television .
Fifty years is not that much time to meet one of the greatest challenges our species will ever face .
"Once again , we seem to be failing to have an appropriate emotional response to what we have every reason to believe is coming ."
The computer scientist Stuart Russell has a nice analogy here .
"He said , imagine that we received a message from an alien civilization , which read : &quot; &quot; People of Earth , we will arrive on your planet in 50 years ."
Get ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just counting down the months until the mothership lands ?
We would feel a little more urgency than we do .
"They &apos;ll be grafted onto our brains , and we &apos;ll essentially become their limbic systems ."
"Now , this may in fact be the safest and only prudent path forward , but usually one &apos;s safety concerns about a technology have to be pretty much worked out before you stick it inside your head ."
"And given that the companies and governments doing this work are likely to perceive themselves as being in a race against all others , given that to win this race is to win the world , provided you don &apos;t destroy it in the next moment , then it seems likely that whatever is easier to do will get done first ."
"Now , unfortunately , I don &apos;t have a solution to this problem , apart from recommending that more of us think about it ."
"But the moment we admit that information processing is the source of intelligence , that some appropriate computational system is what the basis of intelligence is , and we admit that we will improve these systems continuously , and we admit that the horizon of cognition very likely far exceeds what we currently know , then we have to admit that we are in the process of building some sort of god ."
Thank you very much .

What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene ?
"&quot; Oh , you &apos;re feeling depressed ? Just shake it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , adults get tricked this way as well , all the time ."
And then you &apos;ll be even more convinced you can &apos;t succeed .
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people function below their actual potential ."
"We were driving with friends down a dark road at night , when a police car stopped us ."
Why ? Because of poor emotional hygiene .
To ruminate means to chew over .
He had visible tumors all over his body .
And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy .
If they felt better about themselves and more empowered ?
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science .
I bring you into a room .
"He gathered his participants and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can solve this problem . &quot;"
Incentivize them .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close ."
"Rewards , by their very nature , narrow our focus , concentrate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many cases ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who sponsored this research ?
The good news is that the scientists who &apos;ve been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
Mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
"In the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management ."
Management did not emanate from nature .
Somebody invented it .
"But if you want engagement , self-direction works better ."
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian ?
And they do something incredibly cool .
"Autonomy , mastery and purpose , the building blocks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another encyclopedia got started ."
The drive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
"I &apos;ve always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 27 .
"That &apos;s when I started writing songs , and even then I only played them for myself ."
Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
"But after a couple of years , just writing songs wasn &apos;t enough ."
"I had all these stories and ideas , and I wanted to share them with people , but physiologically , I couldn &apos;t do it ."
I had this irrational fear .
"But the more I wrote , and the more I practiced , the more I wanted to perform ."
"So on the week of my 30th birthday , I decided I was going to go to this local open mic , and put this fear behind me ."
"Well , when I got there , it was packed ."
There were like 20 people there .
( Laughter ) And they all looked angry .
"But I took a deep breath , and I signed up to play , and I felt pretty good ."
"Pretty good , until about 10 minutes before my turn , when my whole body rebelled , and this wave of anxiety just washed over me ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sympathetic nervous system kicks in ."
"So you have a rush of adrenaline , your heart rate increases , your breathing gets faster ."
"Next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion . ( Laughter ) So your mouth gets dry , and blood is routed away from your extremities , so your fingers don &apos;t work anymore ."
"Your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your Spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy . ( Laughter ) That condition is not conducive to performing folk music . ( Laughter )"
"I mean , your nervous system is an idiot ."
"Really ? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution , and it still can &apos;t tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic ?"
( Laughter ) I have never been more terrified — until now .
"( Laughter and cheers ) So then it was my turn , and somehow , I get myself onto the stage , I start my song , I open my mouth to sing the first line , and this completely horrible vibrato — you know , when your voice wavers — comes streaming out ."
"And this is not the good kind of vibrato , like an opera singer has , this is my whole body just convulsing with fear ."
"I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare ."
"I &apos;m embarrassed , the audience is clearly uncomfortable , they &apos;re focused on my discomfort ."
It was so bad .
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
And something good did happen — I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this nervousness .
That night I promised myself : I would go back every week until I wasn &apos;t nervous anymore .
"And I did . I went back every single week , and sure enough , week after week , it didn &apos;t get any better . The same thing happened every week . ( Laughter ) I couldn &apos;t shake it ."
And that &apos;s when I had an epiphany .
"And I remember it really well , because I don &apos;t have a lot of epiphanies . ( Laughter ) All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness ."
"That only seems authentic when I have stage fright , and the more nervous I was , the better the song would be . Easy ."
So I started writing a song about having stage fright .
"First , fessing up to the problem , the physical manifestations , how I would feel , how the listener might feel ."
"And then accounting for things like my shaky voice , and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal , because I was nervous ."
"By having a song that explained what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the audience permission to think about it ."
"They didn &apos;t have to feel bad for me because I was nervous , they could experience that with me , and we were all one big happy , nervous , uncomfortable family . ( Laughter ) By thinking about my audience , by embracing and exploiting my problem , I was able to take something that was blocking my progress , and turn it into something that was essential for my success ."
And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance .
"And then I could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease ."
"And eventually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to play the stage fright song at all ."
"Except for when I was really nervous , like now . ( Laughter ) Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you ?"
( Applause ) Can I have a sip of water ?
( Music ) Thank you .

This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School .
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted .
"In the front , you see , actually , Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant , while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison , the Chief of Urology at Harvard , actually harvesting the kidney ."
The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human .
"That was back in 1954 , 55 years ago ."
Yet we &apos;re still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago .
"Certainly many advances , many lives saved ."
But we have a major shortage of organs .
In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled .
"While , at the same time , the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat ."
That really has to do with our aging population .
We &apos;re just getting older .
Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
"But as we age , our organs tend to fail more ."
"So , that &apos;s a challenge , not just for organs but also for tissues ."
"Trying to replace pancreas , trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson &apos;s ."
These are major issues .
This is actually a very stunning statistic .
Every 30 seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement .
"So , what can we do about it ?"
We &apos;ve talked about stem cells tonight .
That &apos;s a way to do it .
"But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients , in terms of actual therapies for organs ."
Wouldn &apos;t it be great if our bodies could regenerate ?
"Wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies , to actually heal ourselves ?"
"It &apos;s not really that foreign of a concept , actually ; it happens on the Earth every day ."
This is actually a picture of a salamander .
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
You see here a little video .
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander .
"And this is actually real photography , timed photography , showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days ."
You see the scar form .
And that scar actually grows out a new limb .
"So , salamanders can do it ."
Why can &apos;t we ? Why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
"Actually , we can regenerate ."
Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of injury . It happens every day .
"As you age , as you get older ."
Your bones regenerate every 10 years .
Your skin regenerates every two weeks .
"So , your body is constantly regenerating ."
The challenge occurs when there is an injury .
"At the time of injury or disease , the body &apos;s first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body ."
"It basically wants to fight off infection , and seal itself , whether it &apos;s organs inside your body , or your skin , the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in , to seal itself off from the outside ."
"So , how can we harness that power ?"
One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials .
"How does this work ? Well , on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured ."
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body .
And you see that it is injured .
We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge .
"If you build that bridge , and you close off from the outside environment , then you can create that bridge , and cells that regenerate in your body , can then cross that bridge , and take that path ."
That &apos;s exactly what you see here .
"It &apos;s actually a smart biomaterial that we used , to actually treat this patient ."
This was an injured urethra on the left side .
We used that biomaterial in the middle .
"And then , six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra ."
"Turns out your body can regenerate , but only for small distances ."
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter .
"So , we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps ."
"So , we do regenerate , but for limited distances ."
"What do we do now , if you have injury for larger organs ?"
What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter ?
Then we can start to use cells .
"The strategy here , is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ , you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ , less than half the size of a postage stamp , you can then tease that tissue apart , and look at its basic components , the patient &apos;s own cells , you take those cells out , grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities , and then we then use scaffold materials ."
"To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse , or your shirt , but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body ."
It disintegrates a few months later .
It &apos;s acting only as a cell delivery vehicle .
"It &apos;s bringing the cells into the body . It &apos;s allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue , and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away ."
And that &apos;s what we did for this piece of muscle .
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle .
"We take the cells , we expand them , we place the cells on the scaffold , and we then place the scaffold back into the patient ."
"But actually , before placing the scaffold into the patient , we actually exercise it ."
"We want to make sure that we condition this muscle , so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient ."
That &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here . You &apos;re seeing this muscle bio-reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth .
"Okay . These are flat structures that we see here , the muscle ."
What about other structures ?
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .
"Very similar to what we just did , but a little bit more complex ."
"Here we take a scaffold , and we basically — scaffold can be like a piece of paper here ."
And we can then tubularize this scaffold .
"And what we do is we , to make a blood vessel , same strategy ."
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types .
"We take muscle cells , we paste , or coat the outside with these muscle cells , very much like baking a layer cake , if you will ."
You place the muscle cells on the outside .
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
You now have your fully seeded scaffold .
You &apos;re going to place this in an oven-like device .
"It has the same conditions as a human body , 37 degrees centigrade , 95 percent oxygen ."
"You then exercise it , as what you saw on that tape ."
And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered .
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain .
"And this is an X-ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel ."
"More complex structures such as blood vessels , urethras , which I showed you , they &apos;re definitely more complex because you &apos;re introducing two different cell types ."
But they are really acting mostly as conduits .
You &apos;re allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states .
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs .
"Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity , because you &apos;re asking these organs to act on demand ."
"So , the bladder is one such organ ."
"Same strategy , we take a very small piece of the bladder , less than half the size of a postage stamp ."
"We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components , muscle , and these bladder specialized cells ."
We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities .
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ .
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder .
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells .
We coat the outside with these muscle cells .
We place it back into this oven-like device .
"From the time you take that piece of tissue , six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient ."
This actually shows the scaffold .
The material is actually being coated with the cells .
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient .
"We brought patients in , six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery , did X-rays , and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient &apos;s size pelvic cavity ."
"For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes , small , medium , large and extra-large ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s true .
And I &apos;m sure everyone here wanted an extra-large . Right ?
"( Laughter ) So , bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures ."
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
"This is actually a heart valve , which we engineered ."
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy .
"We take the scaffold , we seed it with cells , and you can now see here , the valve leaflets opening and closing ."
We exercise these prior to implantation .
Same strategy .
And then the most complex are the solid organs .
"For solid organs , they &apos;re more complex because you &apos;re using a lot more cells per centimeter ."
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear .
It &apos;s now being seeded with cartilage .
That &apos;s the oven-like device ; once it &apos;s coated it gets placed there .
And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold .
This is actually digits that we &apos;re engineering .
"These are being layered , one layer at a time , first the bone , we fill in the gaps with cartilage ."
We then start adding the muscle on top .
And you start layering these solid structures .
"Again , fairly more complex organs , but by far , the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized , highly vascularized , a lot of blood vessel supply , organs such as the heart , the liver , the kidneys ."
This is actually an example — several strategies to engineer solid organs .
This is actually one of the strategies . We use a printer .
"And instead of using ink , we use — you just saw an inkjet cartridge — we just use cells ."
This is actually your typical desktop printer .
"It &apos;s actually printing this two chamber heart , one layer at a time ."
"You see the heart coming out there . It takes about 40 minutes to print , and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract ."
"( Applause ) This technology was developed by Tao Ju , who worked at our institute ."
"And this is actually still , of course , experimental , not for use in patients ."
Another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs .
"We actually take donor organs , organs that are discarded , and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs ."
"So , for example on the left panel , top panel , you see a liver ."
"We actually take the donor liver , we use very mild detergents , and we , by using these mild detergents , we take all the cells out of the liver ."
"Two weeks later , we basically can lift this organ up , it feels like a liver , we can hold it like a liver , it looks like a liver , but it has no cells ."
"All we are left with is the skeleton , if you will , of the liver , all made up of collagen , a material that &apos;s in our bodies , that will not reject ."
We can use it from one patient to the next .
We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
"You can see , actually that &apos;s a fluoroscopy ."
We &apos;re actually injecting contrast into the organ .
Now you can see it start . We &apos;re injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver .
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact .
"We then take the cells , the vascular cells , blood vessel cells , we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient &apos;s own cells ."
We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient &apos;s own liver cells .
And we can then create functional livers .
And that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
"This is still experimental . But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure , experimentally ."
"For the kidney , as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw , the first slide I showed you , 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney , 90 percent ."
"So , another strategy we &apos;re following is actually to create wafers that we stack together , like an accordion , if you will ."
"So , we stack these wafers together , using the kidney cells ."
And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we &apos;ve engineered .
They are actually making urine .
"Again , small structures , our challenge is how to make them larger , and that is something we &apos;re working on right now at the institute ."
One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we &apos;re going for in regenerative medicine .
"If at all possible , we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs ."
"We are limited with distances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time ."
"If we cannot use smart biomaterials , then we &apos;d rather use your very own cells ."
Why ? Because they will not reject .
"We can take cells from you , create the structure , put it right back into you , they will not reject ."
"And if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from your very specific organ ."
If you present with a diseased wind pipe we &apos;d like to take cells from your windpipe .
If you present with a diseased pancreas we &apos;d like to take cells from that organ .
Why ? Because we &apos;d rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want .
A windpipe cell already knows it &apos;s a windpipe cell .
We don &apos;t need to teach it to become another cell type .
"So , we prefer organ-specific cells ."
"And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body , except for several which we still need stem cells for , like heart , liver , nerve and pancreas ."
And for those we still need stem cells .
If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we &apos;d like to use donor stem cells .
And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .
"And we &apos;re working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago , stem cells from the amniotic fluid , and the placenta , which have those properties ."
"So , at this point , I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have ."
"You know , I just showed you this presentation , everything looks so good , everything works . Actually no , these technologies really are not that easy ."
Some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span .
"So , these are very tough technologies ."
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it .
But it takes a lot to get there .
"So , I always like to show this cartoon ."
This is how to stop a runaway stage .
"And there you see the stagecoach driver , and he goes , on the top panel , He goes A , B , C , D , E , F."
He finally stops the runaway stage .
"And those are usually the basic scientists , The bottom is usually the surgeons ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m a surgeon so that &apos;s not that funny . ( Laughter )
But actually method A is the correct approach .
"And what I mean by that is that anytime we &apos;ve launched one of these technologies to the clinic , we &apos;ve made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients ."
And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question .
"Are you ready to place this in your own loved one , your own child , your own family member , and then we proceed ."
"Because our main goal , of course , is first , to do no harm ."
"I &apos;m going to show you now , a very short clip , It &apos;s a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs ."
We started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago .
"So , we have patients now walking around with organs , engineered organs , for over 10 years , as well ."
I &apos;m going to show a clip of one young lady .
"She had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality ."
She did not have a normal bladder . This is a segment from CNN .
We are just taking five seconds .
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of .
"Video : Kaitlyn M : I &apos;m happy . I was always afraid that I was going to have like , an accident or something ."
"And now I can just go and go out with my friends , go do whatever I want ."
"Anthony Atala : See , at the end of the day , the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise ."
"And that is really very simple , to make our patients better ."
Thank you for your attention .

"Imagine , if you will — a gift ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the size of a golf ball .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
It will recalibrate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
"You &apos;ll expand your vocabulary , meet new people , and you &apos;ll have a healthier lifestyle ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
You &apos;ll eat countless gourmet meals .
Flowers will arrive by the truckload .
"People will say to you , &quot; You look great . Have you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
"You &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled ."
Your life will have new meaning .
"Peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana ."
The price ?
"$ 55,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal ."
By now I know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
This gift came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a rare gem — a brain tumor , hemangioblastoma — the gift that keeps on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m okay now , I wouldn &apos;t wish this gift for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn &apos;t expect in all the ways I just shared with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift ."

"Some 17 years ago , I became allergic to Delhi &apos;s air ."
"My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent , and it was killing me ."
"With the help of IIT , TERI , and learnings from NASA , we discovered that there are three basic green plants , common green plants , with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy ."
"We &apos;ve also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building , while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards ."
"The three plants are Areca palm , Mother-in-Law &apos;s Tongue and money plant ."
The botanical names are in front of you .
Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen .
"We need four shoulder-high plants per person , and in terms of plant care , we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi , and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities ."
"We had to grow them in vermi manure , which is sterile , or hydroponics , and take them outdoors every three to four months ."
"The second plant is Mother-in-law &apos;s Tongue , which is again a very common plant , and we call it a bedroom plant , because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night ."
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
"The third plant is money plant , and this is again a very common plant ; preferably grows in hydroponics ."
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
"With these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need ."
"In fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air ."
"We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi , which is a 50,000-square-feet , 20-year-old building ."
"And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants ."
Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one &apos;s blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours .
The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi .
"And the study showed that , compared to other buildings , there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent , respiratory systems by 34 percent , headaches by 24 percent , lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent ."
"And this study has been published on September 8 , 2008 , and it &apos;s available on the government of India website ."
Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants .
"And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent , because you need less fresh air ."
"We are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building , which will have 60,000 indoor plants ."
Why is this important ?
"It is also important for the environment , because the world &apos;s energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade ."
"40 percent of the world &apos;s energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world &apos;s population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years ."
And there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places .
"&quot; Be the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said Mahatma Gandhi ."
And thank you for listening .

( Laughter ) I was afraid of womanhood .
"Not that I &apos;m not afraid now , but I &apos;ve learned to pretend ."
I &apos;ve learned to be flexible .
"In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"Back in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , when I was growing up , little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft , and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy — really not quite clear what we were supposed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were plenty of role models all around us .
"We had our mothers , our aunts , our cousins , our sisters , and of course , the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words , telling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a homemaker , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do girlie things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me pink outfits ."
"Instead , she knew what I needed , and she bought me a book of cartoons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I drew , and I drew , and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family , I could draw , do what I wanted to do , and not have to perform , not have to speak — I was very shy — and I could still get approval ."
I was launched as a cartoonist .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are rules out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t perform them right , even though we are imprinted at birth with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important color in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supposed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to wear — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our hair — ( Laughter ) — and how to behave .
Now the rules that I &apos;m talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture .
"We &apos;re being corrected , and the primary policemen are women , because we are the carriers of the tradition ."
We pass it down from generation to generation .
Not only that — we always have this vague notion that something &apos;s expected of us .
"And on top of all off these rules , they keep changing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it puts us in a very tenuous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these rules , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I follow them half the time , not quite aware that I &apos;m following them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with humor ?"
Humor relies on the traditions of a society .
"It takes what we know , and it twists it ."
"It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress , and it makes it unexpected , and that &apos;s what elicits a laugh ."
Now what if you put together women and humor ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground floor , and we know the traditions so well , we can bring a different voice to the table ."
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos .
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
"during the Civil Rights movement , the assassinations , the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement , and I think I was drawing , trying to figure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in chaos , and I drew to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with laughter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"My parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to wear high heels , I didn &apos;t have to wear pink , and I could feel like I fit in ."
"Now when I was a little older , in my 20s , I realized there are not many women in cartooning ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I became a cartoonist ."
"And then I thought — in my 40s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always loved political cartoons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we &apos;re following as well as laugh ? &quot; &quot; Now my perspective is a particularly — ( Laughter ) — my perspective is a particularly American perspective ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"Even though I &apos;ve traveled a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the rules that I &apos;m talking about are universal , of course — that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions , and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S."
"Consequently , we have ."
"Women , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tradition ."
We have amazing antennae .
"Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists , which I so enjoy , and it &apos;s given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth , to get at the issues quickly and succinctly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect , but through the heart ."
"My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world — countries such as Saudi Arabia , Iran , Turkey , Argentina , France — and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties ."
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances .
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions , because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers , that we can have the great potential to be change-agents ."
"And I think , I truly believe , that we can change this thing one laugh at a time ."
Thank you .

"Throughout the history of computers we &apos;ve been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild ."
"But I wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ?"
I started to imagine what this would look like .
"First , I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it transfers its physical body into pixels ."
"Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen ."
"So with this tool , this boundary has been broken ."
But our two hands still remain outside the screen .
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
"At Microsoft Applied Sciences , along with my mentor Cati Boulanger , I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace ."
"( Applause ) Because windows and files have a position in the real space , selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf ."
"Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines , words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window ."
Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly .
"So in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world ."
But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ?
But now you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
This is a view that you get from head-mounted or see-through display when the system understands the geometry of your body .
"Taking this idea further , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ?"
What would such a future look like ?
"At MIT Media Lab , along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post , we created this one physical pixel ."
"Well , in this case , this spherical magnet acts like a 3D pixel in our space , which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space ."
What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies .
"And by digitally programming the object , we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space , which means that now , human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world ."
"Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it &apos;s very powerful ."
And what &apos;s more exciting than just turning what &apos;s currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities .
"Today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination ."
Thank you .

Another update : You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker .
It &apos;s like a water dowsing device .
It &apos;s just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around .
"And you walk around , and it points to things ."
"Oh , sorry . ( Laughter ) This particular one that was given to me finds golf balls , especially if you &apos;re at a golf course and you check under enough bushes ."
"Well , under the category of &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the harm of silly stuff like this ? &quot; &quot; this device , the ADE 651 , was sold to the Iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece ."
"It &apos;s just like this one , completely worthless , in which it allegedly worked by &quot; &quot; electrostatic magnetic ion attraction , &quot; &quot; which translates to &quot; &quot; pseudoscientific baloney &quot; &quot; — would be the nice word — in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good , but it does absolutely nothing ."
"In this case , at trespass points , allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay , actually cost lives ."
So what I want to talk about today is belief .
"I want to believe , and you do too ."
"And in fact , I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things ."
It is the default option . We just believe .
We believe all sorts of things .
"Belief is natural ; disbelief , skepticism , science , is not natural ."
It &apos;s uncomfortable to not believe things .
"So like Fox Mulder on &quot; &quot; X-Files , &quot; &quot; who wants to believe in UFOs ? Well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains ."
"Essentially , we are pattern-seeking primates ."
We connect the dots : A is connected to B ; B is connected to C.
"And sometimes A really is connected to B , and that &apos;s called association learning ."
"We find patterns , we make those connections , whether it &apos;s Pavlov &apos;s dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food , and then he salivates to the sound of the bell , or whether it &apos;s a Skinnerian rat , in which he &apos;s having an association between his behavior and a reward for it , and therefore he repeats the behavior ."
"Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice ."
"And that &apos;s called superstition , and that , I &apos;m afraid , we will always have with us ."
"When we do this process , we make two types of errors ."
Our second type of error is a false negative .
A Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is .
So let &apos;s do a thought experiment .
"Your name is Lucy , okay ?"
And you hear a rustle in the grass .
"Is it a dangerous predator , or is it just the wind ?"
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life .
But no harm . You just move away .
You &apos;ve just won a Darwin award .
You &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
Now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a Type I error is less than the cost of making a Type II error .
This is the only equation in the talk by the way .
So the default position is just : Believe all patterns are real — All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind .
And so I think that we evolved ...
"So for example , what do you see here ?"
"It &apos;s a horse head , that &apos;s right ."
It looks like a horse . It must be a horse .
That &apos;s a pattern .
And is it really a horse ?
Or is it more like a frog ?
"Yes , of course , it &apos;s a cow ."
Some people see a Dalmatian dog .
"Yes , there it is . And there &apos;s the prime ."
What do you see here ?
"Planet Saturn . Yes , that &apos;s good ."
How about here ?
Just shout out anything you see .
"That &apos;s a good audience , Chris ."
"Because there &apos;s nothing in this . Well , allegedly there &apos;s nothing ."
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson at U.T. Austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns .
"People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is allegedly patternless ."
"In other words , the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there &apos;s a lack of control ."
Because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times .
"So their superstitions , their patternicities , are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth ."
"What do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?"
Anybody see an object there ?
"There actually is something here , but it &apos;s degraded ."
"And those who scored high on the ESP scale , tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns ."
Here is what you show subjects .
"A similar experiment was done by another &#91; Swiss &#93; psychologist named Peter Brugger , who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere , via the left visual field , than the left hemisphere ."
"Brugger and his colleague , Christine Mohr , gave subjects L-DOPA ."
"L-DOPA &apos;s a drug , as you know , given for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease , which is related to a decrease in dopamine ."
L-DOPA increases dopamine .
An increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine .
So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity .
"In fact , neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior , things like paranoia , delusions and hallucinations , these are patternicities ."
They &apos;re incorrect patterns . They &apos;re false positives . They &apos;re Type I errors .
"That is , you decrease the amount of dopamine , and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases ."
"On the other hand , amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists ."
They increase the amount of dopamine .
"So you &apos;re more likely to feel in a euphoric state , creativity , find more patterns ."
"In fact , I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine , when he had that issue , than now ."
So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity .
"Dopamine , I think , changes our signal-to-noise ratio ."
"That is , how accurate we are in finding patterns ."
You think people are talking about you .
"And if you go too far on that , that &apos;s just simply labeled as madness ."
"It &apos;s a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates , Richard Feynman and John Nash ."
One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize .
"The other one also , but maybe too many patterns ."
And we then call that schizophrenia .
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem .
"And of course you all know exactly what this is , right ?"
And what pattern do you see here ?
"Again , I &apos;m putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here , causing you conflicting pattern detections ."
"You know , of course , this is Via Uno shoes ."
These are sandals .
"Pretty sexy feet , I must say ."
Maybe a little Photoshopped .
"And of course , the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth ."
It turns out what you &apos;re thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see .
"And you see the lamp here , I know ."
Because the lights on here .
"You see a dolphin here , and there &apos;s a dolphin , and there &apos;s a dolphin ."
"That &apos;s a dolphin tail there , guys ."
"( Laughter ) If we can give you conflicting data , again , your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive ."
"If you look down here , it &apos;s fine . If you look up here , then you get conflicting data ."
The impossible crate illusion .
It &apos;s easy to fool the brain in 2D .
"So you say , &quot; &quot; Aw , come on Shermer , anybody can do that in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that . &quot; &quot; Well here &apos;s the late , great Jerry Andrus &apos; &quot; &quot; impossible crate &quot; &quot; illusion in 3D , in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate ."
And he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal .
This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle .
"In fact , it &apos;s the exact same picture side by side ."
"So what you &apos;re doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one , but with that one ."
And so your brain is fooled .
Here &apos;s some faces on the side of a rock .
I &apos;m actually not even sure if this is — this might be Photoshopped .
"But anyway , the point is still made ."
"In a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?"
The one on the left . Okay . So I &apos;ll rotate it so it &apos;ll be the one on the right .
And you are correct .
A fairly famous illusion — it was first done with Margaret Thatcher .
"Now , they trade up the politicians every time ."
"Well , why is this happening ?"
"Well , we know exactly where it happens , in the temporal lobe , right across , sort of above your ear there , in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus ."
"And there &apos;s two types of cells that do this , that record facial features either globally , or specifically these large , rapid-firing cells , first look at the general face ."
And then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth .
"Especially when they &apos;re upside down , you &apos;re engaging that general facial recognition software there ."
What &apos;s the difference between those ?
"Well , the wind is inanimate ; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent ."
"That is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning , intention and agency , often invisible beings from the top down ."
"This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here , Dan Dennett , who talked about taking the intentional stance ."
"It &apos;s the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us , more moral than us , and the narratives always are that they &apos;re coming here to save us and rescue us from on high ."
"The intelligent designer &apos;s always portrayed as this super intelligent , moral being that comes down to design life ."
"And this is also , I think , the basis of conspiracy theories ."
"But this is a pattern detection problem , isn &apos;t it ?"
Some patterns are real and some are not .
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin ?
"Well , if you go there — there &apos;s people there on any given day — like when I went there , here — showing me where the different shooters were ."
My favorite one was he was in the manhole .
"And he popped out at the last second , took that shot ."
"Because , let &apos;s face it , some patterns are real ."
"Explains a lot , maybe ."
And 9 / 11 has a conspiracy theory . It is a conspiracy .
Because it worked .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we are natural-born dualists .
Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
"Because we can imagine , in essence , continuing on ."
"Or you can do it through loss of consciousness , by accelerating in a centrifuge ."
"You get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen ."
And the brain then senses that there &apos;s an out-of-body experience .
So I &apos;m going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together .
It &apos;s just a minute and a half .
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief .
Go ahead and roll it .
"Woman : We &apos;re hoping we can use part of this in a national commercial , right ?"
And this is test on some lip balms that we have over here .
"And these are our models who are going to help us , Roger and Matt ."
"And we have our own lip balm , and we have a leading brand ."
Would you have any problem kissing our models to test it ?
Girl : No .
I &apos;m going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
"Girl : Yes . ( Woman : Okay . ) Now , what I &apos;m going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips , the texture , right , and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not ."
Girl : Okay . ( Woman : Have you ever done a kissing test before ? ) Girl : No .
Woman : Take a step here .
"Okay , now I &apos;m going to ask you to pucker up ."
"Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?"
( Music ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Woman : Okay .
"And , Jennifer , how did that feel ?"
Jennifer : Good .
( Laughter ) Girl : Oh my God ! ( Laughter )
Michael Shermer : Thank you very much . Thank you . Thanks .
But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We stumbled on your video on decimals , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more primitive .
And the Khan Academy videos are there .
Green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible . Right now
"there &apos;s a first-year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards , who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately , while at the same time saying to herself over and over again , &quot; Don &apos;t smile till November , &quot; because that &apos;s what she was taught in her teacher education program ."
"Right now there &apos;s a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he &apos;s very , very sick and can &apos;t make it to school tomorrow ."
"Right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention , a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before , but if they close their eyes tightly enough , they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling ."
Right now .
"So people will then say , &quot; &quot; Well , Chris , you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you &apos;re also describing these powerful educators ."
"If you &apos;re thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular , these guys will probably cancel each other out , and then we &apos;ll be okay . &quot; &quot; The reality is , the folks I described as the master teachers , the master narrative builders , the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms ."
The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don &apos;t even know what teacher certification means .
They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education .
And that to me is sad .
"It &apos;s sad because the people who I described , they were very disinterested in the learning process , want to be effective teachers , but they have no models ."
I &apos;m going to paraphrase Mark Twain .
"Mark Twain says that proper preparation , or teaching , is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good , it can turn awful practices into powerful ones , it can change men and transform them into angels ."
"The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching , not in any college or university , but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage ."
"Barber shops , rap concerts , and most importantly , in the black church ."
And I &apos;ve been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy .
We got a couple of hands .
"You go to a black church , their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience , so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes , and then he takes a pause , and he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my gosh , they &apos;re not quite paying attention . &quot; &quot; So he says , &quot; &quot; Can I get an amen ? &quot; &quot; Audience : Amen ."
Chris Emdin : So I can I get an amen ? Audience : Amen .
"CE : And all of a sudden , everybody &apos;s reawoken ."
That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention .
"He drops his voice at a very , very low volume when he wants people to key into him , and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers ."
"So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills , that magic that you need to engage an audience , to engage a student ?"
"So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education , that we could focus on content , and that &apos;s fine , and we could focus on theories , and that &apos;s fine , but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing ."
"And when they try to describe what that is , they just say , &quot; &quot; He has that magic . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m here to tell you that magic can be taught ."
"Interestingly , I asked this question when I was a little kid ."
"Some got killed , and some did it without drug assistance ."
And then the next step is another 15 volts .
They said only one percent .
Milgram did more than 16 studies .
And it happens when you &apos;re in a new or unfamiliar situation .
A white guy falls on the tracks .
"Take path one , you &apos;re going to be a perpetrator of evil ."
"You &apos;re going to cheat , or you &apos;re going to allow bullying ."
"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence , and it is my job , my responsibility , as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort ."
"It involves data from a NASA mission , ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy ."
It began in 2009 with the launch of NASA &apos;s Kepler mission .
Kepler &apos;s main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system .
"It did this by staring at a single field in the sky , this one , with all the tiny boxes ."
"And in this one field , it monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars continuously for four years , taking a data point every 30 minutes ."
It was looking for what astronomers call a transit .
"This is when the planet &apos;s orbit is aligned in our line of sight , just so that the planet crosses in front of a star ."
"And when this happens , it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight , which you can see as a dip in this curve ."
And so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the Kepler data .
"At the same time of the first data release , astronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing : What if computers missed something ?"
And so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters to have people look at the same data .
"The human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition , sometimes even better than a computer ."
"However , there was a lot of skepticism around this ."
"My colleague , Debra Fischer , founder of the Planet Hunters project , said that people at the time were saying , &quot; You &apos;re crazy . There &apos;s no way that a computer will miss a signal . &quot;"
"And so it was on , the classic human versus machine gamble ."
"And if we found one planet , we would be thrilled ."
"When I joined the team four years ago , we had already found a couple ."
"And today , with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts , we have found dozens , and we &apos;ve also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy ."
"So to understand this , let me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like ."
"On this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light , and on the bottom is time ."
"The white line is light just from the star , what astronomers call a light curve ."
"And so , for example , let &apos;s take Jupiter ."
Planets don &apos;t get much bigger than Jupiter .
Jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star &apos;s brightness .
"Earth , on the other hand , is 11 times smaller than Jupiter , and the signal is barely visible in the data ."
So back to our mystery .
"A few years ago , Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits , and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC 8462852 ."
"The observations in May of 2009 were the first they spotted , and they started talking about this in the discussion forums ."
"You see , transits normally only last for a few hours , and this one lasted for almost a week ."
"They were also saying that it looks asymmetric , meaning that instead of the clean , U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter , it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side ."
This seemed to indicate that whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet .
"There are few more dips that happened , but for a couple of years , it was pretty quiet ."
"And then in March of 2011 , we see this ."
We described this feature as both smooth and clean .
"It also is asymmetric , having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week , and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days ."
"And again , after this , not much happens until February of 2013 ."
Things start to get really crazy .
"There is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear , and they last for like a hundred days , all the way up into the Kepler mission &apos;s end ."
These dips have variable shapes .
"Some are very sharp , and some are broad , and they also have variable durations ."
"Some last just for a day or two , and some for more than a week ."
"And there &apos;s also up and down trends within some of these dips , almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other ."
"And at this time , this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent ."
This is truly remarkable .
"And so the citizen scientists , when they saw this , they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up ."
"And so when the science team looked at it , we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , there &apos;s probably just something wrong with the data . &quot; &quot; But we looked really , really , really hard , and the data were good ."
"And so what was happening had to be astrophysical , meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight ."
"And the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery , they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand ."
"First , somebody said , you know , what if this star was very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it ."
"And then somebody else said , well , what if the star had already formed planets , and two of these planets had collided , similar to the Earth-Moon forming event ."
"Well , both of these theories could explain part of the data , but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young , and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star &apos;s light , and you would expect this if the star was young or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced ."
"And so somebody else said , well , how about a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit ?"
"Well , it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations ."
"But I agree , it does feel a little contrived ."
"You see , it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we &apos;re observing ."
And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star .
"And so in reality , we &apos;re talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets ."
"But of all the bad ideas we had , this one was the best ."
And so we went ahead and published our findings .
"Now , let me tell you , this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote ."
"Scientists are meant to publish results , and this situation was far from that ."
( Laughter ) So this isn &apos;t the end of the story .
"Around the same time I was writing this paper , I met with a colleague of mine , Jason Wright , and he was also writing a paper on Kepler data ."
"And he was saying that with Kepler &apos;s extreme precision , it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars , but it didn &apos;t ."
"And then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; Aw crap , Tabby ."
So we had to find a way to rule out aliens .
"So together , we convinced a colleague of ours who works on SETI , the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence , that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue ."
We wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world &apos;s largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory .
"A couple months later , news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles , over 10,000 articles , on this star alone ."
"And if you search Google Images , this is what you &apos;ll find ."
"Now , you may be wondering , OK , Tabby , well , how do aliens actually explain this light curve ?"
"OK , well , imagine a civilization that &apos;s much more advanced than our own ."
"In this hypothetical circumstance , this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet , so where could they get more energy ?"
"Well , they have a host star just like we have a sun , and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star , then that would solve their energy needs ."
So they would go and build huge structures .
"These giant megastructures , like ginormous solar panels , are called Dyson spheres ."
This image above are lots of artists &apos; impressions of Dyson spheres .
"It &apos;s really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things , but you can think of it this way ."
And now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star .
"You can see how it would produce anomalies in the data such as uneven , unnatural looking dips ."
But it remains that even alien megastructures cannot defy the laws of physics .
Another idea that &apos;s one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet .
"Now , I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don &apos;t observe ."
"But if we &apos;re already invoking aliens in this explanation , then who is to say they didn &apos;t efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes ?"
( Laughter ) You can see how this quickly captures your imagination .
"Well , there you have it ."
We &apos;re in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don &apos;t understand or an alien technology we don &apos;t understand .
"Personally , as a scientist , my money is on the natural explanation ."
"But don &apos;t get me wrong , I do think it would be awesome to find aliens ."
"Either way , there is something new and really interesting to discover ."
So what happens next ?
We need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what &apos;s happening .
"But professional astronomers , like me , we have limited resources for this kind of thing , and Kepler is on to a different mission ."
"You see , this time , amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities , and I am so excited to see what they find ."
What &apos;s amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren &apos;t looking for something like this .
There are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky .
And just think : What will it mean when we find another star like this ?
And what will it mean if we don &apos;t find another star like this ?
Thank you .

What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left San Francisco , where I live , on Monday , and I was getting on the plane for this conference ."
The three of us take this class together .
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
"Obviously . Why are you even asking ? &quot; &quot; If you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone helped them , they got lucky , they worked really hard ."
"Boy , it matters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard .
This is the complication .
The data shows this very clearly .
Phyllis Rodriguez : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .
And it is .
"And yet , it feels natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th , 2001 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later .
"At the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my husband , Orlando , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful ."
"And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him , if convicted , my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that , publicly ."
"Through that and through human rights groups , we were brought together with several other victims &apos; families ."
"When I saw Aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a brave woman ."
Someday I want to meet that woman when I &apos;m stronger . &quot; &quot; I was still in deep grief ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the strength .
"I knew I would find her someday , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a victim , I got immediate sympathy ."
"But when people learned what her son was accused of , she didn &apos;t get that sympathy ."
But her suffering is equal to mine .
"So we met in November 2002 , and Aicha will now tell you how that came about ."
"( Translator ) Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen ."
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims .
So they introduced me to five families .
"And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were brothers , sisters ."
"And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suffered a lot as a mother .
I was married when I was 14 .
"I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 16 ."
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
"And I still suffer , because my son is like he &apos;s buried alive ."
I know she really cried for her son .
But she knows where he is .
"My son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s alive . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s tortured .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suffering is something positive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against terrorism ."
"I go to schools to talk to young , Muslim girls so they don &apos;t accept to be married against their will very young ."
"So if I can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
"PR : I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha , starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members — which was a very private meeting with security , because it was November 2002 , and , frankly , we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country — those of us family members ."
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"Before we knew each others &apos; names , or anything , we had embraced and wept ."
"Then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation ."
"And Aicha started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families ."
"I know what it is to suffer , and I feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . &quot; &quot; But she reached out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ice-breaker ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connected as human beings ."
By the end of the afternoon — it was about three hours after lunch — we &apos;d felt as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being afraid of the other , but making that step and then realizing , &quot; &quot; Hey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Who else can I meet that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , Aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( Translator ) AW : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous ."
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
And I hope that someday we &apos;ll all live together in peace and respecting each other .
This is what I wanted to say .

"In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar ."
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
"But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims ."
"When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail ."
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world &apos;s populous faces : not having detailed maps .
But help was coming .
"At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points ."
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
"People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store ."
Maps matter .
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
"For example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone ."
"In the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable ."
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .
Let &apos;s look at some of the maps being created by users right now .
"So , as we speak , people are mapping the world in these 170 countries ."
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal .
"And , closer to home , Chalua , an N.G. road in Bangalore ."
"This is the result of computational geometry , gesture recognition , and machine learning ."
"This is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time ."
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet .
Welcome to the new world .

"So , I was in the hospital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very excited . I walked with him to his office ."
"And he explained to me that , when I shave , I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair , and this creates lack of symmetry ."
And what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave .
"Let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave , because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the width the same ."
"When I got back to his office , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots — not very informative ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have lasers ; we can whiten it out . &quot;
"But I was still concerned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life ."
"This is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ? &quot; &quot; None of those happened .
"And this was very surprising to me , because I &apos;ve gone through many treatments — there were many treatments I decided not to do — and I never got this guilt trip to this extent ."
But I decided not to have this treatment .
"And I went to his deputy and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
"Right , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was running some of my own experiments in the lab ."
"And when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another ."
"So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high , another group that I thought their performance would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — aside from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .
"And he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test ."
So I looked carefully at this guy .
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; Fantastic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s throw him out .
"Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"Would we have thrown him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; Fantastic ! What a smart guy who is performing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statistical results than we could ."
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we &apos;ve done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces ."
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens ."
"Maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account ."
Because we don &apos;t see how conflicts of interest work on us .
"When I was doing these experiments , in my mind , I was helping science ."
I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a knight trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions .
"And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors , because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances ."
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
"I mean , this is all very depressing , right — people have conflicts of interest , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The positive perspective , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things ."
"And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the truth of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compare societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I &apos;m going to be showing you exist .
"But first , see what a miserable lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a paradox .
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income — how rich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like Norway and the USA , are twice as rich as Israel , Greece , Portugal on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
There &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society ."
"This , again , is life expectancy ."
"These are small areas of England and Wales — the poorest on the right , the richest on the left ."
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at relative income or social position , social status — where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us ."
"And as soon as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should immediately wonder : what happens if we widen the differences , or compress them , make the income differences bigger or smaller ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hypothetical data .
I &apos;m taking data from the U.N. — it &apos;s the same as the World Bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can download it , is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equal countries on the left — Japan , Finland , Norway , Sweden — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent ."
"But on the more unequal end — U.K. , Portugal , USA , Singapore — the differences are twice as big ."
"On that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder ."
"Internationally comparable data on life expectancy , on kids &apos; maths and literacy scores , on infant mortality rates , homicide rates , proportion of the population in prison , teenage birthrates , levels of trust , obesity , mental illness — which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction — and social mobility ."
We put them all in one index .
They &apos;re all weighted equally .
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things .
"And there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I &apos;ve just shown you , which I shall use over and over again in the data ."
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
"But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita , gross national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no correlation anymore ."
"We were a little bit worried that people might think we &apos;d been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence , so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being ."
It has 40 different components put together by other people .
"It contains whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have books at home , what immunization rates are like , whether there &apos;s bullying at school ."
Everything goes into it .
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
Highly significant relationship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in relation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relationship , no suggestion of a relationship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve shown you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in poorer countries , but not in the rich developed world ."
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the separate bits of our index .
"Here , for instance , is trust ."
It &apos;s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
It comes from the World Values Survey .
"You see , at the more unequal end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others ."
"But in the more equal societies , it rises to 60 or 65 percent ."
"And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital , very similar relationships closely related to inequality ."
"I may say , we did all this work twice ."
"We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we repeated it all on the 50 American states — asking just the same question : do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ?"
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality .
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
Same thing is going on .
Basically we found that almost anything that &apos;s related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
This is mental illness .
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others .
"And again , closely related to inequality ."
This is violence .
"These red dots are American states , and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces ."
But look at the scale of the differences .
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
This is the proportion of the population in prison .
"There &apos;s a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
"In some places , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more punitive sentencing , harsher sentencing ."
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
Here we have children dropping out of high school .
"Again , quite big differences ."
"Extraordinarily damaging , if you &apos;re talking about using the talents of the population ."
This is social mobility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mobility based on income .
"Basically , it &apos;s asking : do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons , or is there no relationship between the two ?"
"And at the more unequal end , fathers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.K. , USA ."
"And in Scandinavian countries , fathers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mobility .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here — if Americans want to live the American dream , they should go to Denmark ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve shown you just a few things in italics here .
I could have shown a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient .
"But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Think of the expense , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points .
"One is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , whatever the outcome , seem to be the more unequal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , Sweden and Japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sorts of ways ."
"The position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality .
"Sweden has huge differences in earnings , and it narrows the gap through taxation , general welfare state , generous benefits and so on ."
Japan is rather different though .
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax .
It has lower taxes .
It has a smaller welfare state .
"And in our analysis of the American states , we find rather the same contrast ."
"There are some states that do well through redistribution , some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax ."
"So we conclude that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your greater equality , as long as you get there somehow ."
"I am not talking about perfect equality , I &apos;m talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies ."
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are affected by inequality .
There seems to be some truth in John Donne &apos;s &quot; No man is an island . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s infant mortality .
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification .
"And so it &apos;s anachronistically a classification by fathers &apos; occupations , so single parents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social class , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s unskilled manual occupations ."
"It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations — doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies ."
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy .
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society ."
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally .
"And that seems to be the general picture — that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom , but has some benefits even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality .
"More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority , of being valued and devalued , respected and disrespected ."
"And of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society ."
It also leads to status insecurity .
"We worry more about how we &apos;re judged and seen by others , whether we &apos;re regarded as attractive , clever , all that kind of thing ."
"The social-evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social-evaluative judgments ."
"Interestingly , some parallel work going on in social psychology : some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones , their responses to doing stressful tasks , measured ."
"And in the review , what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol , the central stress hormone ."
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat — threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress .
Now we have been criticized .
"Of course , there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising ."
"I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data , we never pick and choose data ."
"We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the analysis ."
"Our data source decides whether it &apos;s reliable data , we don &apos;t ."
Otherwise that would introduce bias .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals .
"This isn &apos;t confined to these countries here , hiding a very simple demonstration ."
"The same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we control for other factors ?
Well we &apos;ve shown you that GNP per capita doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on ."
What about causality ?
Correlation in itself doesn &apos;t prove causality .
We spend a good bit of time .
"And indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes ."
"The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system , the cardiovascular system ."
"Or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to deal with this , we &apos;ve got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things ."
"We &apos;ve got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top ."
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can .
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us .
"Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exciting ."
Thank you .

"In 2012 , when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gabés , in the south of Tunisia , I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city ."
"At the beginning , I was just looking for a wall in my hometown , and it happened that the minaret was built in &apos; 94 ."
"And for 18 years , those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey ."
"When I met the imam for the first time , and I told him what I wanted to do , he was like , &quot; &quot; Thank God you finally came , &quot; &quot; and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it ."
"The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn &apos;t ask me anything — neither a sketch , or what I was going to write ."
"In every work that I create , I write messages with my style of calligraffiti — a mix of calligraphy and graffiti ."
I use quotes or poetry .
"I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting , and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world ."
"For the imam , it was not just the painting ; it was really deeper than that ."
"He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city , and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia ."
"The universality of the message , the political context of Tunisia at this time , and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant ."
It reunited the community .
"Bringing people , future generations , together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do ."
Writing messages is the essence of my artwork .
"What is funny , actually , is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I &apos;m writing ."
You don &apos;t need to know the meaning to feel the piece .
I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes .
There is a beauty in it that you don &apos;t need to translate .
"Arabic script speaks to anyone , I believe ; to you , to you , to you , to anybody , and then when you get the meaning , you feel connected to it ."
"I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I &apos;m painting , but messages that have a universal dimension , so anybody around the world can connect to it ."
"I was born and raised in France , in Paris , and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18 ."
Today I only write messages in Arabic .
"One of the reasons this is so important to me , is because of all the reaction that I &apos;ve experienced all around the world ."
"In Rio de Janeiro , I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa , who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela , and then I painted it on the rooftop ."
"The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing , but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy , they thanked me , as they felt connected to the piece ."
"In South Africa , in Cape Town , the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum ."
"And when he saw I was painting in Arabic , he got so mad — actually , hysterical — and he asked for the wall to be erased ."
I was mad and disappointed .
"But a week later , the organizer of the event asked me to come back , and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy &apos;s house ."
"So , this guy — ( Laughter ) like , was forced to see it every day ."
"At the beginning , I was going to write , &quot; &quot; &#91; In Arabic &#93; , &quot; &quot; which means , &quot; &quot; In your face , &quot; &quot; but — ( Laughter ) I decided to be smarter and I wrote , &quot; &quot; &#91; In Arabic &#93; , &quot; &quot; which means , &quot; &quot; Open your heart . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really proud of my culture , and I &apos;m trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork ."
"And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know , with the beauty of Arabic script ."
"Today , I don &apos;t write the translation of the message anymore on the wall ."
"Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door , but for me , it &apos;s more an invitation — to my language , to my culture , and to my art ."
Thank you .

I &apos;d like you to imagine the world anew .
Here &apos;s an image that you &apos;re very familiar with .
I &apos;m old enough that I was actually born before we saw this image .
"It &apos;s only been a few centuries since we &apos;ve actually , most of us , thought of our planet as spherical ."
"When we first saw these images in the 1960s , the world was changing at an incredible rate ."
"It &apos;s a map in which we stretched places , so that those areas which contain many people are drawn larger , and those areas , like the Sahara and the Himalayas , in which there are few people , have been shrunk away ."
Everybody on the planet is given an equal amount of space .
The cities are shown shining bright .
The lines are showing you submarine cables and trade routes .
"And there &apos;s one particular line that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian through past Singapore , through the Suez Canal , through the Mediterranean and round to Rotterdam ."
"This is Çatalhöyük , one of the world &apos;s first cities ."
"At its peak 9,000 years ago , people had to walk over the roofs of others &apos; houses to get to their home ."
"If you look carefully at the map of the city , you &apos;ll see it has no streets , because streets are something we invented ."
The world changes .
It changes by trial and error .
"Again , the underlying map is the map of world population , but over it , you &apos;re seeing arrows showing how we spread out of Africa with dates showing you where we think we arrived at particular times ."
"I have to redraw this map every few months , because somebody makes a discovery that a particular date was wrong ."
We are learning about ourselves at an incredible speed .
And we &apos;re changing .
A lot of change is gradual .
It &apos;s accretion .
"We don &apos;t notice the change because we only have short lives , 70 , 80 , if you &apos;re lucky 90 years ."
And people were scared .
They were scared of population growth and what they called &quot; &quot; the population bomb &quot; &quot; in 1968 .
"But then , if you look at the end of the graph , the growth began to slow ."
Our planet is stabilizing .
"Within that change , you can see tumult ."
You can see the Second World War .
You can see the great Chinese famine .
These are the events we tend to concentrate on .
We worry about people .
We worry about how many people there are .
We worry about how you can get away from people .
"So if you want to know where to go to get away from everybody , here &apos;s the best places to go ."
"And every year , these areas get bigger , because every year , we are coming off the land globally ."
Our world is changing .
You have worries .
This is a map showing where the water falls on our planet .
We now know that .
"Instead of making the map be shaped by people , we can shape the map by water , and then we can change it every month to show the amount of water falling on every small part of the globe ."
"And you see the monsoons moving around the planet , and the planet almost appears to have a heartbeat ."
We have enough water .
This is a map of where we grow our food in the world .
You will have seen this map of the world before .
"When you normally see that map , on a normal map , the kind of map that most of you will be used to , you think you are seeing a map of where people live ."
Where the lights are shining up is where people live .
Everywhere has the same density of people on this map .
And the world didn &apos;t end .
"A few years ago , the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year ."
"I can give you good news story after good news story about what is getting better in the planet , but we tend to concentrate on the bad news that is immediate ."
You are shown those terrible things on the news every night of the week .
You are not told about the population slowing down .
You are not told about the world becoming more connected .
You are not told about how we are learning to begin to waste less and consume less .
This is my last map .
You can see that Europe is on the edge .
And we in Exeter today are on the far edge of the planet .
"We are living in a stabilizing world , an urbanizing world , an aging world , a connecting world ."
"There are many , many things to be frightened about , but there is no need for us to fear each other as much as we do , and we need to see that we are now living in a new world ."
Thank you very much .

I &apos;m here to recruit men to support gender equality .
What do men have to do with gender equality ?
"Gender equality is about women , right ?"
"Actually , I &apos;m even here speaking as a middle class white man ."
"Now , I wasn &apos;t always a middle class white man ."
"It all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in graduate school , and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day , and we said , you know , there &apos;s an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory , but there &apos;s no courses yet ."
So we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that .
"We &apos;ll read a text , we &apos;ll talk about it , we &apos;ll have a potluck dinner ."
"( Laughter ) So every week , 11 women and me got together . ( Laughter )"
We would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it .
"And during one of our conversations , I witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever ."
It was a conversation between two women .
"One of the women was white , and one was black ."
"And the white woman said — this is going to sound very anachronistic now — the white woman said , &quot; &quot; All women face the same oppression as women ."
"All women are similarly situated in patriarchy , and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood . &quot; &quot; And the black woman said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not so sure ."
"Let me ask you a question . &quot; &quot; So the black woman says to the white woman , &quot; &quot; When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror , what do you see ? &quot; &quot; And the white woman said , &quot; &quot; I see a woman . &quot; &quot; And the black woman said , &quot; &quot; You see , that &apos;s the problem for me ."
"Because when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I see a black woman ."
"To me , race is visible . But to you , race is invisible . You don &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And then she said something really startling ."
"She said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s how privilege works ."
"Privilege is invisible to those who have it . &quot; &quot; It is a luxury , I will say to the white people sitting in this room , not to have to think about race every split second of our lives . Privilege is invisible to those who have it ."
"Now remember , I was the only man in this group ,"
"so when I witnessed this , I went , &quot; &quot; Oh no . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And somebody said , &quot; &quot; Well what was that reaction ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror , I see a human being ."
I &apos;m kind of the generic person .
"You know , I &apos;m a middle class white man . I have no race , no class , no gender ."
"I had to start thinking about them , and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long ."
"Now , I wish I could tell you this story ends 30 years ago in that little discussion group , but I was reminded of it quite recently at my university where I teach ."
"I have a colleague , and she and I both teach the sociology of gender course on alternate semesters ."
So she gives a guest lecture for me when I teach .
"All that semester , whenever my colleague opened her mouth , what my students saw was a woman ."
"I mean , if you were to say to my students , &quot; There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States , &quot; they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Well of course you &apos;d say that ."
"Is that going to be on the test ? How do you spell &apos; structural &apos; ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I hope you all can see , this is what objectivity looks like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Disembodied Western rationality . ( Laughter )
"And that , by the way , is why I think men so often wear ties . ( Laughter )"
"Because if you are going to embody disembodied Western rationality , you need a signifier , and what could be a better signifier of disembodied Western rationality than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals ?"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That is mind-body dualism right there .
So making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality .
I was on a TV talk show opposite four white men .
"It was a quote from one of the men , and the quote was , &quot; A Black Woman Stole My Job . &quot;"
I want to know about the word &apos; my . &apos; Where did you get the idea it was your job ?
"Of course , it &apos;s fair , it &apos;s right and it &apos;s just ."
"But more than that , gender equality is also in our interest as men ."
"If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives , gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live ."
Gender equality is good for countries .
"It turns out , according to most studies , that those countries that are the most gender equal are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale ."
And that &apos;s not just because they &apos;re all in Europe .
"( Laughter ) Even within Europe , those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness ."
It is also good for companies .
"Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are , the better it is for workers , the happier their labor force is ."
They have lower job turnover . They have lower levels of attrition .
They have an easier time recruiting .
"And I say , &quot; &quot; Oh no , in fact , what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you ."
It is extremely expensive . &quot; &quot; So it is good for business .
"And the other thing is , it &apos;s good for men ."
"It is good for the kind of lives we want to live , because young men especially have changed enormously , and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children ."
"They expect their partners , their spouses , their wives , to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are ."
"I was talking , to give you an illustration of this change — Some of you may remember this ."
"When I was a lot younger , there was a riddle that was posed to us ."
Some of you may wince to remember this riddle .
This riddle went something like this .
How is this possible ?
We were flummoxed by this .
We could not figure this out .
"( Laughter ) Well , I decided to do a little experiment with my 16-year old son ."
"So I decided I would pose this riddle to them , just to see , to gauge the level of change ."
"Well , 16-year-old boys , they immediately turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s his mom . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
No problem . Just like that .
"Except for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; Well , he could have two dads . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That &apos;s an index , an indicator of how things have changed ."
Younger men today expect to be able to balance work and family .
"They want to be dual-career , dual-carer couples ."
They want to be able to balance work and family with their partners .
They want to be involved fathers .
"Now , it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships , the happier both partners are ."
Data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here .
"I think we have the persuasive numbers , the data , to prove to men that gender equality is not a zero-sum game , but a win-win ."
Here &apos;s what the data show .
We pitch in and we help out .
"Their children have lower rates of absenteeism , higher rates of achievement ."
They are less likely to be put on medication .
"Not only that , their wives are healthier ."
"Their wives are less likely to see a therapist , less likely to be diagnosed with depression , less likely to be put on medication , more likely to go to the gym , report higher levels of marital satisfaction ."
"They smoke less , drink less , take recreational drugs less often ."
They are less likely to go to the ER but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings .
And who wouldn &apos;t want that ?
"( Laughter ) Now , of these four fascinating findings , which one do you think Men &apos;s Health magazine put on its cover ? ( Laughter )"
&quot; &quot; Housework Makes Her Horny .
These data were collected over a really long period of time .
It &apos;s not a win-lose .
It is a win-win for everyone .
And what we also know is we cannot fully empower women and girls unless we engage boys and men .
We know this .
And my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live .
"In 1915 , on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations down Fifth Avenue in New York City , a writer in New York wrote an article in a magazine , and the title of the article was , &quot; Feminism for Men . &quot;"
And this was the first line of that article : &quot; Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free . &quot;
Thank you .

"Okay , religious mania : there &apos;s rapture , there &apos;s weeping , there &apos;s visions ."
Manias can be good .
A mania for learning English .
T : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down !
T : Most importantly ... S : Most importantly ...
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .
T : I want to speak perfect English !
S ( yelling more loudly ) : I want to change my life !
"Is English a tsunami , washing away other languages ?"
The world has other universal languages .
How would you like to be better than you are ?
"Suppose I said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory — more precise , more accurate and quicker ."
"Or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina ."
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ?
How about living longer with good health ?
Or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always yearned for more creativity .
Which one would you like the most ?
"Which would you like , if you could have just one ?"
( Audience Member : Creativity . ) Creativity .
How many people would choose creativity ?
Raise your hands . Let me see .
A few . Probably about as many as there are creative people here .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s very good .
How many would opt for memory ?
Quite a few more .
How about fitness ?
A few less .
What about longevity ?
"Ah , the majority . That makes me feel very good as a doctor ."
"If you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world ."
Is it just imaginary ?
"Or , is it , perhaps , possible ?"
"Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference , but I want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject ."
"The great 20th-century geneticist , T.G. Dobzhansky , who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church , once wrote an essay that he titled &quot; &quot; Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution . &quot; &quot; Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device — I give you permission — and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you ."
"( Laughter ) But if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?"
"Does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?"
This is another look at the tree of life .
"In this picture , I &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment ."
"The human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in ."
We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
"In the interval , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids ."
Some have come and gone .
"We have been here for about 130,000 years ."
"It may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same ."
Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics ?
This is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas .
"And speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?"
Maybe 10 times more .
"I mean think of it , when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?"
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
"It &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s moist , it &apos;s very cozy ."
And you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
"It &apos;s really like an Easy Street for bacteria , with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit ."
"But otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life ."
"They help in the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases ."
But what will come in the future ?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ?
"Or , are we destined to become something different — something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?"
"Now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago — the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years — the first signs of proto-life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi-celled organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago — and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130,000 years ."
"In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on Earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small grace note ."
That was us .
"That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk , so I hope you enjoyed it ."
"( Laughter ) Now when I was a freshman in college , I took my first biology class ."
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
"I became enamored of the power of evolution , and I realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms , each cell simply divides , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells ."
"But at the time multi-celled organisms come online , things start to change ."
Sexual reproduction enters the picture .
"And very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expendable ."
"In fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction ."
"Now I have to confess , when I was a college undergraduate , I thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , I &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts ."
"I &apos;ve come to understand the sentiments of George Burns , who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s ."
"And one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door ."
He answers the door .
"Standing before him is a gorgeous , scantily clad showgirl ."
"She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;"
"&quot; That &apos;s fine , &quot; says George , &quot; I &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I came to realize , as a physician , that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory , just different ."
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted to keep us healthy .
I wanted to restore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
"Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation ."
"From an evolutionary point of view , you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea ."
"I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work ."
I want to achieve it through not dying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived .
"It doesn &apos;t necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest ."
Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
That is the sole test of survival and success .
"At the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sous-vide cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , I would say that there are a number of possibilities ."
The first is that we will not evolve .
We have reached a kind of equipoise .
"And the reasoning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population ."
"And secondly , we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it ."
"And by the way , we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature ."
"And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly , but they are inexorable ."
"And as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a third possibility , an enticing , intriguing and frightening possibility ."
"I call it neo-evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"Consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring ."
"They &apos;re , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females ."
"It &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing ."
"Think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases ."
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
Wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
"If we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible ."
"The Human Genome Project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years ."
It cost 2.7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"Today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone ."
"Just a week ago , the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way — what Frances Arnold calls &quot; &quot; directed evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and by manipulating just four genes , he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell — a cell potentially capable"
of becoming any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses ."
"Believe it or not , there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant ."
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
"These are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be evermore possible ."
Imagine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?"
"What if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life — eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?"
Who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
"And then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super-attributes , hyper-capacities — that better memory ."
"Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings , especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine ?"
Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be irresistible .
"And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"These are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them ."
"Will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?"
"Or , will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform , or more robust and more versatile ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most profoundly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inherit the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wisely ?"
"For better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"One thing the world needs , one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates ."
We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument .
I have a suggestion .
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion .
"First , let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality , give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens , Aristotle &apos;s theory of justice , and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle &apos;s ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the lecture ?"
"According to Aristotle , justice means giving people what they deserve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lecture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s obvious enough ."
The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why .
Take the example of flutes .
Suppose we &apos;re distributing flutes .
Who should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Who should get the best flute ?
You can just call it out .
( Audience : Random . ) Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery .
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
How many say the best flute players ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a harder question .
"Why do you think , those of you who voted this way , that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ?"
Peter : The greatest benefit to all .
MS : The greatest benefit to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
That &apos;s Peter ? ( Audience : Peter . ) MS : All right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music .
"But Peter , Aristotle doesn &apos;t agree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
"He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes argue about , the purpose of the thing , or the social activity — in this case , musical performance ."
"And the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music ."
It &apos;ll be a happy byproduct that we &apos;ll all benefit .
"But when we think about justice , Aristotle says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing ."
"Now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case ."
Let &apos;s take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .
It had to do with golf .
"Casey Martin — a few years ago , Casey Martin — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good golfer , but he had a disability ."
"He had a bad leg , a circulatory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course ."
"In fact , it carried risk of injury ."
"He asked the PGA , the Professional Golfers &apos; Association , for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot; &quot; He sued , and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great golfer ."
I want to compete .
But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next . &quot; &quot; Suppose you were on the Supreme Court .
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .
How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"All right , let &apos;s take a poll , show of hands ."
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"All right , we have a good division of opinion here ."
"Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart , what would be your reason ?"
"Raise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a microphone ."
( Audience : It &apos;d be an unfair advantage . ) MS : It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart .
"All right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage ."
How would you answer the objection ?
"Yes , all right ."
Audience : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
Charlie : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : But what about walking from hole to hole ?
Charlie : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ?
"Charlie : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"MS : All right . Stay there , Charlie ."
( Laughter ) Who has an answer for Charlie ?
"All right , who has an answer for Charlie ?"
What would you say ?
"Audience : The endurance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes ."
MS : Walking all those holes ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ( Audience : Absolutely . ) MS : What &apos;s your name ? ( Audience : Warren . ) MS : Warren .
"Charlie , what do you say to Warren ?"
Charley : I &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
Warren : I am not a golfer .
"Charley : And I am . ( MS : Okay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lower court , they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue ."
Is walking the course essential to the game ?
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer .
And what do you suppose they all said ?
Yes . They agreed with Warren .
"They said , yes , walking the course is strenuous physical exercise ."
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart .
"Now , notice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Supreme Court first ."
The Supreme Court decided .
What do you suppose they said ?
"They said yes , that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart ."
"Seven to two , they ruled ."
"What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we &apos;ve just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf ."
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question .
"And Justice Stevens , writing for the majority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible , and that walking was not essential , but incidental ."
"Now , there were two dissenters , one of whom was Justice Scalia ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have granted the cart , and he had a very interesting dissent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority &apos;s opinion .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .
Justice Scalia &apos;s opinion is questionable for two reasons .
"First , no real sports fan would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary , rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring , we wouldn &apos;t care about the outcome of the game ."
It &apos;s also objectionable on a second ground .
"On the face of it , it seemed to be — this debate about the golf cart — an argument about fairness , what &apos;s an unfair advantage ."
"But if fairness were the only thing at stake , there would have been an easy and obvious solution ."
"But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been , I suspect , more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA , even than making an exception for Casey Martin ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as delicately as possible : Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .
"( Laughter ) After all , there &apos;s no running or jumping , and the ball stands still . ( Laughter )"
"So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer , the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes ."
"That illustrates that with golf , as with flutes , it &apos;s hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grappling with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essential nature of the activity in question , and what qualities , what excellences connected with that activity , are worthy of honor and recognition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a final example that &apos;s prominent in contemporary political debate : same-sex marriage ."
"There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman , and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage ."
How many here favor the first policy : the state should recognize traditional marriage only ?
"And how many favor the second , same-sex marriage ?"
"The opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging ."
"So with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , Aristotle has a point ."
Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition .
"So let &apos;s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elevate , the terms of political discourse in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that &apos;s a recipe for disagreement , and for that matter , a recipe for intolerance and coercion ."
"So better to shy away from , to ignore , the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"Thank you very much . Thanks . Thank you . Chris . Thanks , Chris . Chris Anderson : From flutes to golf courses"
to same-sex marriage — that was a genius link .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pioneer of open education ."
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
"MS : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"CA : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from China and India joining in ?"
"MS : Right . We did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach , and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about 1,000 students ."
"Wouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge , Massachusetts and create a global classroom ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"I want to talk today about — I &apos;ve been asked to take the long view , and I &apos;m going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view ."
"Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers , which is encouraging ."
It seems that there &apos;s not just one person who thinks that these problems are important .
The first is — death is a big problem .
"If you look at the statistics , the odds are not very favorable to us ."
"So far , most people who have lived have also died ."
Roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now .
"So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 — sorry , the daily death rate — 150,000 people per day , which is a huge number by any standard ."
"The annual death rate , then , becomes 56 million ."
"If we just look at the single , biggest cause of death — aging — it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die ."
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada .
"Sometimes , we don &apos;t see a problem because either it &apos;s too familiar or it &apos;s too big ."
Can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
"So that would be , roughly , 324 people have died since I &apos;ve begun speaking ."
People like — it &apos;s roughly the population in this room has just died .
"Now , the human cost of that is obvious , once you start to think about it — the suffering , the loss — it &apos;s also , economically , enormously wasteful ."
"I just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general , and aging , in particular ."
"Now , of course , this is an underestimation ."
A person &apos;s lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book .
But let &apos;s suppose we did this .
"52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds , then , to 52 million volumes destroyed ."
Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes .
We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria .
"It &apos;s one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember , even today ."
"But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress — burnt down , forever lost — each year ."
So that &apos;s the first big problem .
"And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey , and other people like him , to try to do something about this as soon as possible ."
Existential risk — the second big problem .
"Existential risk is a threat to human survival , or to the long-term potential of our species ."
"You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big , but it &apos;s a very neglected area ."
"But there have been four studies — one by John Lesley , wrote a book on this ."
"Similarly , the Astronomer Royal , whom we heard speak yesterday , also has a 50 percent probability estimate ."
"Another author doesn &apos;t give any numerical estimate , but says the probability is significant that it will fail ."
I wrote a long paper on this .
I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have .
Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees .
Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million .
So that &apos;s a large number .
"If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronomical ."
"Then , even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number — 10 to the power of 32 ."
"So if you take into account future generations as much as our own , every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant ."
"Now , let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem , because it &apos;s more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp ."
"Think about some time in your life — some people might never have experienced it — but some people , there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic ."
"It might have been at the moment of some great , creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage ."
Or when you understood something you had never done before .
Or an aesthetic experience — a sunset or a great piece of art .
"And you wonder , why can &apos;t it be like that all the time ?"
You just want to cling onto this .
"And then , of course , it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades ."
"And it &apos;s really difficult to recall , in a normal frame of mind , just how good life can be at its best ."
Or how bad it can be at its worst .
The third big problem is that life isn &apos;t usually as wonderful as it could be .
It &apos;s easy to say what we don &apos;t want .
"Here are a number of things that we don &apos;t want — illness , involuntary death , unnecessary suffering , cruelty , stunted growth , memory loss , ignorance , absence of creativity ."
Suppose we fixed these things — we did something about all of these .
We were very successful .
We got rid of all of these things .
"We might end up with something like this , which is — I mean , it &apos;s a heck of a lot better than that ."
But is this really the best we can dream of ?
Is this the best we can do ?
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards ?
"And if we think about this , I think it &apos;s very clear that there are ways in which we could change things , not just by eliminating negatives , but adding positives ."
"On my wish list , at least , would be : much longer , healthier lives , greater subjective well-being , enhanced cognitive capacities , more knowledge and understanding , unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits , better relationships , an unbounded potential for spiritual , moral and intellectual development ."
"If we want to achieve this , what , in the world , would have to change ?"
And this is the answer — we would have to change .
"Not just the world around us , but we , ourselves ."
"Not just the way we think about the world , but the way we are — our very biology ."
Human nature would have to change .
It &apos;s a pretty pathetic list .
"They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition , but for most people , they don &apos;t really transform what it is to be human ."
It &apos;s worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use .
"We have skin enhancements , clothing ."
"As far as I can see , all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room , so that &apos;s a great thing ."
"Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial — caffeine , alcohol , nicotine , immune system enhancement , vision enhancement , anesthetics — we take that very much for granted , but just think about how great progress that is — like , having an operation before anesthetics was not fun ."
"Contraceptives , cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques — that sounds ominous , but the distinction between what is a technology — a gadget would be the archetype — and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle ."
You &apos;re changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along .
"So in a broad sense , we don &apos;t need to think about technology as only little gadgets , like these things here , but even institutions and techniques , psychological methods and so forth ."
Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature .
"It &apos;s possible to assume , setting aside a possibility of catastrophe , that sooner or later we will develop all of these ."
And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition .
So let &apos;s look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement .
These are really great things .
Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people — they &apos;re positional goods .
But part of the reason — and that &apos;s the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these — is that they &apos;re also intrinsically valuable .
"It &apos;s just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with , and to remember what you have learned ."
Modalities and special faculties .
"Now , the human mind is not a single unitary information processor , but it has a lot of different , special , evolved modules that do specific things for us ."
"All of these would enable , in principle — be amenable to enhancement ."
Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have .
"It &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are — so if these all enabled great values , why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be ?"
"But maybe they have another faculty , something else that would seem equally irrational to us , but they actually tap into some great possible value there ."
Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control .
Greater subjective well-being .
"Be able to switch between relaxation and activity — being able to go slow when you need to do that , and to speed up ."
Conscientiousness and sympathy .
"The ability to — it &apos;s another interesting application that would have large social ramification , perhaps ."
"If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person , undiminished through time , so that wouldn &apos;t have to — love would never have to fade if you didn &apos;t want it to ."
That &apos;s probably not all that difficult .
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this .
It &apos;s been done in voles .
You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it &apos;s naturally polygamous .
It &apos;s just a single gene .
"A possible mode of being here would be a way of life — a way of being , experiencing , thinking , seeing , interacting with the world ."
"Down here in this little corner , here , we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings — beings with our biological capacities ."
"It &apos;s a part of the space that &apos;s accessible to animals ; since we are animals , we are a subset of that ."
And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities .
"There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for , say , 200 years ."
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are .
"So then , you move off to this larger sphere of &quot; &quot; human + , &quot; &quot; and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being ."
"Now , why is that a good thing to do ?"
"Well , we know already that in this little human circle there , there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being — human life at its best is wonderful ."
"We have no reason to believe that within this much , much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being , perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about ."
Thanks .
What you have here is an electronic cigarette .
"It &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was invented a year or two ago , has given me untold happiness ."
"( Laughter ) A little bit of it , I think , is the nicotine , but there &apos;s something much bigger than that ."
"Which is ever since , in the U.K. , they banned smoking in public places , I &apos;ve never enjoyed a drinks party ever again ."
"( Laughter ) And the reason , I only worked out just the other day , which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people , you don &apos;t actually want to spend all the time talking ."
"It &apos;s really , really tiring ."
"Sometimes you just want to stand there silently , alone with your thoughts ."
Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window .
"Now the problem is , when you can &apos;t smoke , if you stand and stare out of the window on your own , you &apos;re an antisocial , friendless idiot ."
"( Laughter ) If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette , you &apos;re a fucking philosopher . ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated .
"What we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but one of them makes you feel great and the other one , with just a small change of posture , makes you feel terrible ."
And I think one of the problems with classical economics is it &apos;s absolutely preoccupied with reality .
And reality isn &apos;t a particularly good guide to human happiness .
"Why , for example , are pensioners much happier than the young unemployed ?"
"Both of them , after all , are in exactly the same stage of life ."
You both have too much time on your hands and not much money .
"But pensioners are reportedly very , very happy , whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed ."
"The reason , I think , is that the pensioners believe they &apos;ve chosen to be pensioners , whereas the young unemployed feel it &apos;s been thrust upon them ."
"In England the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly , because they &apos;ve re-branded unemployment ."
"If you &apos;re an upper-middle-class English person , you call unemployment &quot; &quot; a year off . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s because having a son who &apos;s unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing , but having a son who &apos;s unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment . ( Laughter )"
"But actually the power to re-brand things — to understand that actually our experiences , costs , things don &apos;t actually much depend on what they really are , but on how we view them — I genuinely think can &apos;t be overstated ."
There &apos;s an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor .
"Every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs ."
The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box .
"And when it nuzzles the button , the electric shock stops ."
The other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
"It &apos;s exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box , but it has no control over the circumstances ."
Generally the first dog can be relatively content .
The second dog lapses into complete depression .
The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
We ask the question — the whole debate in the Western world is about the level of taxation .
"But I think there &apos;s another debate to be asked , which is the level of control we have over our tax money ."
That what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse .
What costs us 10 pounds in a different context we may actually welcome .
"You know , pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health and you &apos;re merely feeling a mug ."
"Pay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward and you &apos;re called a philanthropist ."
I &apos;m probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;ll give you one in return . How you frame things really matters .
Do you call it the bailout of Greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece ?
Because they are actually the same thing .
"What you call them actually affects how you react to them , viscerally and morally ."
I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest .
"One of my great friends , a professor called Nick Chater , who &apos;s the Professor of Decision Sciences in London , believes that we should spend far less time looking into humanity &apos;s hidden depths and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows ."
I think that &apos;s true actually .
I think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do .
But what we don &apos;t have is a really good model of human psychology .
"At least pre-Kahneman perhaps , we didn &apos;t have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering , of neoclassical economics ."
So people who believed in psychological solutions didn &apos;t have a model .
We didn &apos;t have a framework .
This is what Warren Buffett &apos;s business partner Charlie Munger calls &quot; a latticework on which to hang your ideas . &quot;
"Engineers , economists , classical economists all had a very , very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung ."
We merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model .
"And what that means is that in looking at solutions , we &apos;ve probably given too much priority to what I call technical engineering solutions , Newtonian solutions , and not nearly enough to the psychological ones ."
You know my example of the Eurostar .
Six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between Paris and London by about 40 minutes .
"For 0.01 percent of this money you could have put WiFi on the trains , which wouldn &apos;t have reduced the duration of the journey , but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more ."
"For maybe 10 percent of the money , you could have paid all of the world &apos;s top male and female supermodels to walk up and down the train handing out free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers ."
"You &apos;d still have five &#91; million &#93; pounds in change , and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down ."
( Laughter ) Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically ?
"I think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an imbalance , an asymmetry , in the way we treat creative , emotionally-driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational , numerical , spreadsheet-driven ideas ."
"If you &apos;re a creative person , I think quite rightly , you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you ."
"You have to go in and you have to have a cost-benefit analysis , a feasibility study , an ROI study and so forth ."
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not apply the other way around .
"People who have an existing framework , an economic framework , an engineering framework , feel that actually logic is its own answer ."
"What they don &apos;t say is , &quot; &quot; Well the numbers all seem to add up , but before I present this idea , I &apos;ll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better . &quot; &quot; And so we , artificially I think , prioritize what I &apos;d call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas ."
"An example of a great psychological idea : The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground per pound spent came when they didn &apos;t add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains , they put dot matrix display board on the platforms ."
"Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality , its duration , but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait ."
"Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock is less frustrating and irritating than waiting four minutes , knuckle-biting going , &quot; &quot; When &apos;s this train going to damn well arrive ? &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in Korea ."
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
It &apos;s proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments .
"Why ? Because road rage , impatience and general irritation are massively reduced when you can actually see the time you have to wait ."
"In China , not really understanding the principle behind this , they applied the same principle to green traffic lights ."
( Laughter ) Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
"You &apos;re 200 yards away , you realize you &apos;ve got five seconds to go , you floor it ."
"( Laughter ) The Koreans , very assiduously , did test both ."
The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights ; it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights .
"This is all I &apos;m asking for really in human decision making , is the consideration of these three things ."
I &apos;m not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other .
"I &apos;m merely saying that when you solve problems , you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle ."
"If you actually look at a great business , you &apos;ll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play ."
"Really , really successful businesses — Google is great , great technological success , but it &apos;s also based on a very good psychological insight : People believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else ."
It &apos;s an innate thing called goal dilution .
Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this .
"Everybody else at the time of Google , more or less , was trying to be a portal ."
"Yes , there &apos;s a search function , but you also have weather , sports scores , bits of news ."
"Google understood that if you &apos;re just a search engine , people assume you &apos;re a very , very good search engine ."
All of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television .
And in the shabbier end of the row of flat screen TVs you can see are these rather despised things called combined TV and DVD players .
"And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things , but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go , &quot; &quot; Uck ."
It &apos;s probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player . &quot; &quot; So we walk out of the shops with one of each .
Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one .
I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn &apos;t even realize were problems at all .
This is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics .
Don &apos;t give them 24 white pills .
Give them 18 white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones .
It &apos;s called chunking .
The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle .
"One of the great mistakes , I think , of economics is it fails to understand that what something is , whether it &apos;s retirement , unemployment , cost , is a function , not only of its amount , but also its meaning ."
This is a toll crossing in Britain .
Quite often queues happen at the tolls .
"Sometimes you get very , very severe queues ."
"You could apply the same principle actually , if you like , to the security lanes in airports ."
"What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge , but go through a lane that &apos;s an express lane ?"
It &apos;s not an unreasonable thing to do . It &apos;s an economically efficient thing to do .
Time means more to some people than others .
"If you &apos;re waiting trying to get to a job interview , you &apos;d patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane ."
"If you &apos;re on the way to visit your mother in-law , you &apos;d probably prefer to stay on the left ."
"The only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution , people hate it ."
"Because they think you &apos;re deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue , and &quot; &quot; Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your imcompetence ? &quot; &quot; On the other hand , change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management , so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company , it goes to charity , and the mental willingness to pay completely changes ."
"You have a relatively economically efficient solution , but one that actually meets with public approval and even a small degree of affection , rather than being seen as bastardy ."
So where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money .
"Actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount , but where I think that money is going ."
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
It could revolutionize the public services .
It could really change things quite significantly .
Here &apos;s a guy you all need to study .
He &apos;s an Austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in Vienna .
What was interesting about the Austrian school is they actually grew up alongside Freud .
And so they &apos;re predominantly interested in psychology .
"They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology , which is a prior discipline to the study of economics ."
"Praxeology is the study of human choice , action and decision making ."
I think they &apos;re right .
I think the danger we have in today &apos;s world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology .
"But as Charlie Munger says , &quot; &quot; If economics isn &apos;t behavioral , I don &apos;t know what the hell is . &quot; &quot; Von Mises , interestingly , believes economics is just a subset of psychology ."
I think he just refers to economics as &quot; the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity . &quot;
"But von Mises , among many other things , I think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of marketing , the value of perceived value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value ."
"We tend to , all of us — even those of us who work in marketing — to think of value in two ways ."
"There &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &apos;s a kind of dubious value , which you create by changing the way people look at things ."
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction .
And he used this following analogy .
"He referred actually to strange economists called the French Physiocrats , who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land ."
"So if you &apos;re a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer , you created true value ."
"If however , you bought some wool from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat , you weren &apos;t actually creating value , you were exploiting the shepherd ."
Now von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake with regard to advertising and marketing .
"He says , if you run a restaurant , there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor ."
"One of them creates , perhaps , the primary product — the thing we think we &apos;re paying for — the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product ."
And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong .
Try this quick thought experiment .
"Imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin-starred food , but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there &apos;s human feces on the floor ."
"The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further , it &apos;s to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor ."
And it &apos;s vital we understand this .
"If that seems like some strange , abstruse thing , in the U.K. , the post office had a 98 percent success rate at delivering first-class mail the next day ."
They decided this wasn &apos;t good enough and they wanted to get it up to 99 .
The effort to do that almost broke the organization .
"If at the same time you &apos;d gone and asked people , &quot; What percentage of first-class mail arrives the next day ? &quot;"
"the average answer , or the modal answer would have been 50 to 60 percent ."
"Now if your perception is much worse than your reality , what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality ?"
That &apos;s like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks .
"What you need to do is first of all tell people that 98 percent of mail gets there the next day , first-class mail ."
That &apos;s pretty good .
"I would argue , in Britain there &apos;s a much better frame of reference , which is to tell people that more first-class mail arrives the next day in the U.K. than in Germany ."
"Because generally in Britain if you want to make us happy about something , just tell us we do it better than the Germans ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed .
It has to be said of the Germans that the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job of creating a united Europe .
The only thing they don &apos;t expect is they &apos;re uniting Europe through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans .
"But I &apos;m British , that &apos;s the way we like it ."
What you also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky .
We can &apos;t tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it .
All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted .
"When you drive away , your car feels as if it drives better ."
"And the reason for this , unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which I &apos;m not paying him for and I &apos;m unaware of , is because perception is in any case leaky ."
Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded .
"I don &apos;t just mean through reported pain reduction , actual measured pain reduction ."
And so perception actually is leaky in any case .
"So if you do something that &apos;s perceptually bad in one respect , you can damage the other ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I work in marketing , which I love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gray hair ."
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
So quick show of hands — who studied some marketing in university ?
Who studied some physics in university ?
Pretty good . And at school ?
"Okay , lots of you ."
"So , hopefully this will bring back some happy , or possibly some slightly disturbing memories ."
"So , physics and marketing ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Newton &apos;s Law : &quot; The force equals mass times acceleration . &quot;
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .
"( Laughter ) But if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle — a larger mass — it requires more force to change its direction ."
"It &apos;s the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning ."
And that &apos;s one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen &apos;s could stand for something other than accountancy .
"It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners , and why companies like Unilever and P &amp; G keep brands separate , like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand ."
"The marketing is , the bigger a brand , the more difficult it is to reposition it ."
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures .
"Now , who remembers Heisenberg &apos;s uncertainty principle ?"
Getting a little more technical now .
"So this says that it &apos;s impossible , by definition , to measure exactly the state — i.e. , the position — and the momentum of a particle , because the act of measuring it , by definition , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it , then the photon of light has momentum , which knocks the particle , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"By measuring it , the act of measurement changes it ."
The act of observation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marketing .
"So with the act of observing consumers , changes their behavior ."
"Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of junk food ."
"And yet , McDonald &apos;s sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year ."
"Yet , at Google , we know it &apos;s the number-one searched for category ."
"So luckily , the science — no , sorry — the marketing is getting easier ."
"Luckily , with now better point-of-sale tracking , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle , because the observation changes it ."
"The marketing is — the message for marketing is — that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anticipate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning , and it will strengthen it , but it will not conclusively prove it ."
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth .
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .
"Take BP — they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident ."
Think about Toyota .
"It was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident ."
"And Tiger Woods , for a long time , the perfect brand ambassador ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis , but it &apos;s easy to disprove it — any hypothesis is shaky ."
"And the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work ."
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand .
"And lastly , to the slightly obscure world of entropy — the second law of thermodynamics ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the disorder of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of marketing .
"If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster .
But then you lose control of it .
"With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer , it &apos;s impossible to control where it goes ."
"Your brand starts being dispersed , ( Laughter ) it gets more chaotic . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your control . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be unsettling for marketers , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand ."
"So , the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundamental law ."
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
"You can &apos;t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century , because during that century , our minds have altered dramatically ."
"As you all know , the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology ."
"And our minds have altered , too ."
"And these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification , introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent , and also taking the hypothetical seriously , that is , wondering about what might have been rather than what is ."
"Now , this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive I.Q. gains over time , and these have been truly massive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests ."
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented .
"Indeed , if you score the people a century ago against modern norms , they would have an average I.Q. of 70 ."
"If you score us against their norms , we would have an average I.Q. of 130 ."
Now this has raised all sorts of questions .
Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation ?
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation .
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and argue for a third alternative that &apos;s much more illuminating than either of those , and to put this into perspective , let &apos;s imagine that a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization ."
"And this Martian was an archaeologist , and they found scores , target scores , that people had used for shooting ."
"And first they looked at 1865 , and they found that in a minute , people had only put one bullet in the bullseye ."
"And then they found , in 1898 , that they &apos;d put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute ."
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye .
"And initially , that archaeologist would be baffled ."
"They would say , look , these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand , how keen their eyesight was , whether they had control of their weapon ."
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible , not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thinker will help us here , and that &apos;s Luria ."
"Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world ."
They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use .
"He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical , to speculating about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions ."
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews .
He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 1900 , about four years of schooling ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do crows and fish have in common ?"
"And the fellow said , &quot; &quot; Absolutely nothing ."
"You know , I can eat a fish . I can &apos;t eat a crow ."
A crow can peck at a fish .
"The other is a bird . &quot; &quot; And he was interested , effectively , in what he could do with those concrete objects ."
"And then Luria went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no camels in Germany ."
Hamburg is a city in Germany .
"Are there camels in Hamburg ? &quot; &quot; And the fellow said , &quot; Well , if it &apos;s large enough , there ought to be camels there . &quot;"
"And Luria said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words imply ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for camels . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem , and he was used to camels being in villages , and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical , to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany ."
A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole .
"And Luria said , &quot; &quot; At the North Pole , there is always snow ."
"Wherever there is always snow , the bears are white ."
"What color are the bears at the North Pole ? &quot; &quot; And the response was , &quot; &quot; Such a thing is to be settled by testimony ."
"If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white , I might believe him , but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear . &quot; &quot; Now you see again , this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience , and it was important to that person what color bears were — that is , they had to hunt bears ."
They weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
"One of them said to Luria , &quot; &quot; How can we solve things that aren &apos;t real problems ?"
None of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few illustrations .
"First , almost all of us today get a high school diploma ."
"That is , we &apos;ve gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of formal education , and 52 percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education ."
"Now , not only do we have much more education , and much of that education is scientific , and you can &apos;t do science without classifying the world ."
You can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logically consistent .
"And even down in grade school , things have changed ."
"They were things like , what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in 1990 , they were all about abstractions ."
"They were things like , why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital ?"
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia .
So the tenor of education has changed .
"We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously , to use abstractions , and to link them logically ."
What about employment ?
"Well , in 1900 , three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding ."
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
"Today , 35 percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions , not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer , but many , many sub-professions having to do with being a technician , a computer programmer ."
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions .
The professions have been upgraded .
"Compare the doctor in 1900 , who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve , with the modern general practitioner or specialist , with years of scientific training ."
They went far beyond that 1900 banker .
They had to look at computer projections for the housing market .
They had to get complicated CDO-squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset .
Or take a farmer today .
I take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of 1900 .
It &apos;s also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
"Now over the last century , in developed nations like America , moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously , and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections ."
"When I came home in 1955 from university at the time of Martin Luther King , a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents ."
"My father was born in 1885 , and he was mildly racially biased ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
"And when we said to our parents and grandparents , &quot; How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the older generation says , well , our government takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their government to take care of them , they &apos;re just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously ."
"Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped , and he feels he &apos;s honor-bound to kill her ."
They &apos;re just inherited mores .
"Today we would say something like , well , imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the Koran ."
That &apos;s not one of the principles I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , universalize your principles ."
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them .
"You have to say , well , blackness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suffer just for that ."
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted .
"And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear , can &apos;t we , and say , well how can you consider all blacks tainted when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black ."
"And you can get moral argument off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not treating moral principles as concrete entities ."
"You &apos;re treating them as universals , to be rendered consistent by logic ."
That &apos;s what initially got me going on cognitive history .
"If you look at the I.Q. test , you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas ."
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions .
"And in 1900 , people could do simple analogies ."
"That is , if you said to them , cats are like wildcats ."
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
"But by 1960 , people could attack Raven &apos;s on a much more sophisticated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two squares followed by a triangle , what follows two circles ?"
They could say a semicircle .
"Just as a triangle is half of a square , a semicircle is half of a circle ."
"By 2010 , college graduates , if you said two circles followed by a semicircle , two sixteens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very disheartening ."
We haven &apos;t made progress on all fronts .
"We &apos;ve noticed , in a trend among young Americans , that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands , and they &apos;re essentially ahistorical ."
They live in the bubble of the present .
They don &apos;t know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War II .
"Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had barely left , and there wasn &apos;t a trace in the sand ."
Or imagine how different things would be if most Americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars .
"You know , the Spanish didn &apos;t sink the battleship Maine , the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions , the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet , and , of course , Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost ."
But I don &apos;t want to end on a pessimistic note .
"Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have ? &quot; &quot; As if they were a reptile ."
"An image is worth more than a thousand words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that I recently captured ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a photographer , as an artist , is to bring the world of art and science together ."
"Whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it &apos;s bursting , as you can see in this image , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint , strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways , or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces , I &apos;m always trying to link those two fields together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects .
The first one has to do with making sound visible .
"Now as you may know , sound travels in waves , so if you have a speaker , a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal , transform it into a vibration , which is then transported through the air , is captured by our ear , and transformed into an audio signal again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound waves visible ?"
So I came up with the following setup .
"I took a speaker , I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker ."
"And now , if I would play a sound through that speaker , it would cause the crystals to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very fast , in the blink of an eye , so , together with LG , we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than 3,000 frames per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( Music : &quot; &quot; Teardrop &quot; &quot; by Massive Attack ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I agree , it looks pretty amazing ."
But I have to tell you a funny story .
I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles .
"Now in Los Angeles , you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches , but I got mine indoors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re shooting at 3,000 frames per second , you need to have a silly amount of light , lots of lights ."
"What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week ."
Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances .
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ?
"Ah , some of you have . Excellent ."
Should I skip that part ?
( Laughter ) Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of metal in it , which makes it magnetic ."
"So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field , it would change its appearance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a camera pointing down at this plate , and underneath that plate , there is a magnet ."
Now I &apos;m going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet .
Let &apos;s just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more . Excellent .
So what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes .
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with .
"So what happened now is , when the watercolor was flowing into the structure , the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid ."
That &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mix with the water .
So that was the second project .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper ?
"Maybe you have experienced some of those properties before , but I am talking about the physical properties , not the other ones ."
"So when I open the bottle , the alcohol molecules would spread in the air , and that &apos;s because alcohol is a very volatile substance ."
"And at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable ."
And it was with those two properties that I was able to create the images that you &apos;re seeing right now .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey .
Add some more .
Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle .
"It goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impressive ."
"So the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees ."
So that &apos;s how those images were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now showed you three projects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
"Those three projects , they &apos;re based on very simple scientific phenomena , such as magnetism , the sound waves , or over here , the physical properties of a substance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way , and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Now , have any of y &apos;all ever looked up this word ?"
"You know , in a dictionary ? ( Laughter ) Yeah , that &apos;s what I thought ."
How about this word ?
"Here , I &apos;ll show it to you ."
Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
"Now , one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don &apos;t usually have a kind of warm , fuzzy , snuggly image of the dictionary ."
"When a guy who looks like that , in that hat , is the face of modernity , you have a problem ."
"And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?"
Online dictionaries must be different .
"Right ? Those little buttons , I had them all expanded except for the date chart ."
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
"And in fact , online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print , except for searchability ."
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan ?
"How can this be ? I mean , I love books . I really love books ."
Some of my best friends are books .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
"Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; &quot; Oh , boy ."
"People are going to take away my beautiful , paper dictionaries ? &quot; &quot; No . There will still be paper dictionaries ."
"When we had cars — when cars became the dominant mode of transportation , we didn &apos;t round up all the horses and shoot them ."
"You know , there &apos;re still going to be paper dictionaries , but it &apos;s not going to be the dominant dictionary ."
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . And it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
"So , think about it this way : if you &apos;ve got an artificial constraint , artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview ."
"We &apos;d know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna , and not very much about much else ."
And I think this is a problem .
"I think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts ."
Lexicography is really more about material science .
"We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression : your speeches and your writing . And then , often people say to me , &quot; Well , OK , how do I know that this word is real ? &quot;"
"If you love a word , use it . That makes it real ."
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
"So if we &apos;re not worrying about directing traffic , if we &apos;ve transcended paper , if we are worrying less about control and more about description , then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile ."
"You didn &apos;t break it . It &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful ."
"But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more eyeballs are better ."
You can ask for help !
"If you ask for help , you get more done . And we really need help ."
"Library of Congress : 17 million books , of which half are in English ."
"Newspaper archive goes back to 1759 , 58.1 million newspaper pages . If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it , it would be an entire other OED ."
"That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot ."
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
"See , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation ."
"If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language , these bright spots are what we know about , and the dark spots are where we are in the dark ."
"If that was the map of all the words in American English , we don &apos;t know very much ."
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
"We just don &apos;t know enough , and we don &apos;t even know that we &apos;re missing California ."
"But even if it were , rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days . You know ?"
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
He &apos;s a director of an electroplating company .
He &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
"He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite , and that &apos;s how he found them ."
"If we can find comets without a telescope , shouldn &apos;t we be able to find words ?"
"Now , y &apos;all know where I &apos;m going with this ."
"Because I &apos;m going to the Internet , which is where everybody goes ."
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
It dies too fast .
"So , this whole time I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; The dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;"
"But the thing is , we could make the dictionary the whole language ."
"If we get a bigger pan , then we can put all the words in ."
We can put in all the meanings .
Doesn &apos;t everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language — we can make it be the whole language .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
Good evening .
"You see , I &apos;m one of the 84 million Americans who are immigrants or children of immigrants ."
"Each of us has a dream when we come here , a dream that usually has to be rewritten and always has to be repurposed ."
I was one of the lucky ones .
"But I don &apos;t want you to think it was a cakewalk , that America opened its arms wide and welcomed me ."
It &apos;s still not doing that .
I came because I wanted to study English literature .
"You see , as a child , I buried my nose in books , and I thought , why not make a living doing that as an adult ?"
Maybe it was the optimism that I had about America that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change .
"The door that I thought was open was actually just slightly ajar — this door of America that would open wide if you had the right name , the right skin color , the right networks , but could just slam in your face if you had the wrong religion , the wrong immigration status , the wrong skin color ."
And I just couldn &apos;t accept that .
"So I started a career as a social entrepreneur , starting an organization for young people like myself — I was young at the time that I started it — who traced their heritage to the Indian subcontinent ."
"In that work , I became and advocate for South Asians and other immigrants ."
I lobbied members of Congress on policy issues .
I volunteered on election day to do exit polling .
"But I couldn &apos;t vote , and I couldn &apos;t run for office ."
"So in 2000 , when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from 95 dollars to 225 dollars , I decided it was time to apply before I could no longer afford it ."
"I filled out a long application , answering questions about my current and my past affiliations ."
You might call it extreme vetting .
"And then in December of 2000 , I joined hundreds of other immigrants in a hall in Brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long considered home ."
Two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in New York City .
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg mayor of New York City .
We also adopted by ballot referendum the Office of Immigrant Affairs for the City of New York .
"Five months after that election , the newly elected mayor appointed me the first Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs for this newly established office ."
I want you to come back to that time .
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize .
I had basically floundered in various jobs in America before I started a community-based organization in a church basement in Queens .
The attacks of September 11 sent shock waves through my community .
No job felt more perfect for me .
And here are two things I learned when I became Commissioner .
"And most of us , when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods feel curiosity , if not concern ."
"Because a raid at your workplace , a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever ."
People in my family were experiencing it .
What I learned in 2001 was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered .
"And it &apos;s these three things — immigrants &apos; votes , voices and vantage points — that I think can help make our democracy stronger ."
"We actually have the power to change the outcome of elections , to introduce new issues into the policy debate and to change the face of the pale , male , stale leadership that we have in our country today ."
"Well , let &apos;s talk first about votes ."
It will come as no surprise to you that the majority of voters in America are white .
"But it might surprise you to know that one in three voters are black , Latino or Asian ."
"So in 2012 , half of the Latino and Asian-American voters did not vote ."
And these votes matter not just in presidential elections .
They matter in local and state elections .
"In 2015 , Lan Diep , the eldest son of political refugees from Vietnam , ran for a seat in the San Jose City Council ."
He lost that election by 13 votes .
"This year , he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back to run for that seat , and this time he won , by 12 votes ."
Every one of our votes matters .
"And when people like Lan are sitting at the policy table , they can make a difference ."
in part because American leadership does not look like America &apos;s residents .
"There are over 500,000 local and state offices in America ."
"Fewer than 2 percent of those offices are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos , the two largest immigrant groups in our country ."
"In the city of Yakima , Washington , where 49 percent of the population is Latino , there has never been a Latino on the city council until this year ."
Three newly elected Latinas joined the Yakima City Council in 2016 .
One of them is Carmen Méndez .
She is a first-generation college student .
"She grew up partly in Colima , Mexico , and partly in Yakima , Washington ."
"She &apos;s a single mother , a community advocate ."
Her voice on the Yakima City Council is advocating on behalf of the Latino community and of all Yakima residents .
And she &apos;s a role model for her daughter and other Latinas .
But the third most untapped resource in American democracy is the vantage point that immigrants bring .
We have fought to be here .
We have come for economic and educational opportunity .
We have come for political and religious freedom .
We have come in the pursuit of love .
"That dedication , that commitment to America we also bring to public service ."
"People like Athena Salman , who just last week won the primary for a seat in the Arizona State House ."
Together they moved to Arizona and built a life .
It &apos;s not just my work . It &apos;s also yours .
And it &apos;s not going to be easy .
We never know what putting a new factor into an equation will do .
And it &apos;s a little scary .
"You &apos;re scared that I &apos;m going to take away your place at the table , and I &apos;m scared that I &apos;m never going to get a place at the table ."
"Look , it &apos;s been a rough election year , a reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader ."
But I have fought to be in this country and I continue to do so every day .
"So my optimism never wavers , because I know that there are millions of immigrants just like me , in front of me , behind me and all around me ."
"It &apos;s our country , too ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Once upon a time , at the age of 24 , I was a student at St. John &apos;s Medical College in Bangalore ."
I was a guest student during one month of a public health course .
And that changed my mindset forever .
"The course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset ."
"It was the brutal realization , the first morning , that the Indian students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study nerd ."
I loved statistics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended .
"But in St. John &apos;s , I was in the lower quarter ."
And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden .
"They read the textbook twice , or three times or four times ."
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
"( Laugher ) And that , to me , that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed ."
And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience .
It &apos;s that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the statistics , although I tried to make it funny ."
"And I will now , here , onstage , try to predict when that will happen — that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will reach that of the West ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average pay , the money for each person , per month , in India and China , when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States ?"
But I will start with a historical background .
And you can see my map if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West .
"That was the year when Queen Victoria was able , for the first time , to communicate with President Buchanan , through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; Twitter &quot; &quot; transatlantically .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Google and Internet , to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . &quot; &quot; Those are nice words . But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom ."
And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia .
1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
1858 in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces .
"And that meant that foreigners , as it said in the treaty , were allowed to trade freely in China ."
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.
"And they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year ."
"But , Japan , in contrast to India and China , maintained its national sovereignty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here , where you can see each bubble is a country ."
The size of the bubble here is the population .
"On this axis , as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar ."
"And on that axis I have life expectancy , the health of people ."
And I also bring an innovation here .
"I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological , recyclable version here , in green India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"Look here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United Kingdom was richer over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"Actually if we go back into the historical record , there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe ."
"But 1850 had already been many , many years of foreign domination , and India had been de-industrialized ."
And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting healthy , and Japan was starting to catch up ."
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
"But really , really natural sovereignty was good for Japan ."
And Japan is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . Health is getting better , United Kingdom , United States ."
But careful now — we are approaching the First World War .
"And the First World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here ."
United Kingdom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
"And then after the First World War , they continue up ."
"Still under foreign domination , and without sovereignty , India and China are down in the corner ."
Not much has happened .
They have grown their population but not much more .
"In the 1930 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a period of war , with lower life expectancy ."
"And the Second World War was really a terrible event , also economically for Japan ."
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .
"And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation , but in very big difficulties down there ."
( Applause ) In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after independence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
"This is the Great Leap Forward , when China fell down ."
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
"China recovered . Then they said , &quot; Nevermore , stupid central planning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to follow ."
And they were catching up indeed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low economy ."
"And we came to 1978 , and Mao Tse Tung died , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Doesn &apos;t matter if a cat is white or black , as long as it catches mice . &quot; &quot; Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two cats being here , China and India , wanting to catch the mices over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy ."
And the market reformer was successful there .
In &apos; 92 India follows with a market reform .
"And they go quite closely together , and you can see that the similarity with India and China , in many ways , are greater than the differences with them ."
And here they march on . And will they catch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the averages there — this is the average of China .
"If I would split China , look here , Shanghai has already catched up ."
Shanghai is already there .
And it &apos;s healthier than the United States .
"But on the other hand , Guizhou , one of the poorest inland provinces of China , is there ."
"And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural , the rural part of Guizhou goes down there ."
"You see this enormous inequity in China , in the midst of fast economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another type of inequity , actually , in India ."
"The geographical , macro-geographical difference is not so big ."
"Uttar Pradesh , the biggest of the states here , is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India ."
"Kerala is flying on top there , matching United States in health , but not in economy ."
"And here , Maharashtra , with Mumbai , is forging forward ."
"Now in India , the big inequities are within the state , rather than between the states ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot inequity , macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living ."
"No , there is one more inequity . Look there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) Oh , they broke my frame ."
"Washington , D.C. went out here ."
My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because Washington , D.C."
is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a business opportunity for Kerala , helping fix the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the legend down there .
"And when you see the two giant cats here , pushing forward , you see that in between them and ahead of them , is the whole emerging economies of the world , which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the &quot; &quot; flat world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is putting forward , but in Africa , and other parts , as in rural Guizhou in China , there is still people with low health and very low economy ."
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast .
"Now , back to my projections ."
When will it catch up ? I have to go back to very conventional graph .
"I will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there ."
"And then time here , from 1858 I start the world ."
And we shall see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here ."
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer .
"And after Second World War , United States is richer than U.K."
But independence is coming here .
"Growth is starting , economic reform ."
"Growth is faster , and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in 2014 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; When will the catch up take place ? &quot; &quot; Look at , look at the United States ."
Can you see the bubble ?
"The bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles ."
That &apos;s the dot com bubble . This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another rock coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know ."
And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia .
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
"You see , Japan did it like that ."
We add Japan to it .
And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
"Japan did it like this , until full catch up , and then they follow with the other high-income economies ."
"But the real projections for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"Can be worse , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future ."
"Now , a historian tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predict about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social instability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population ."
"So , social investments in health , education and infrastructure , and electricity is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the climate . We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing , and actions has to be taken , otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change ."
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy .
"But they ain &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have largely created , and I can agree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
"Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to Asia ?"

"Now , Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more people , but more Chinese people are learning English than English speakers are learning Chinese ."
"Last I heard , there are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English ."
English is taking over .
"And in addition to that , it &apos;s been predicted that at the end of the century almost all of the languages that exist now — there are about 6,000 — will no longer be spoken ."
There will only be some hundreds left .
"And that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts , that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages gives everybody a different kind of acid trip , so to speak ."
So it &apos;s not that it &apos;s untrue completely .
"So for example , in French and Spanish the word for table is , for some reason , marked as feminine ."
"So , &quot; &quot; la table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la mesa , &quot; &quot; you just have to deal with it ."
"So if you &apos;re French or Spanish , to you , a table is kind of a girl , as opposed to if you are an English speaker ."
"It &apos;s hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there &apos;s a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages ."
"But you have to watch out , because imagine if somebody put us under the microscope , the us being those of us who speak English natively ."
What is the worldview from English ?
"So for example , let &apos;s take an English speaker ."
"Up on the screen , that is Bono ."
He speaks English .
I presume he has a worldview .
"Now , that is Donald Trump ."
So here are three speakers of the English language .
What worldview do those three people have in common ?
What worldview is shaped through the English language that unites them ?
It &apos;s a highly fraught concept .
"And so gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought , but it tends to be in rather darling , obscure psychological flutters ."
It &apos;s not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world .
"Now , if that &apos;s the case , then why learn languages ?"
There are some .
"One of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture , if you want to drink it in , if you want to become part of it , then whether or not the language channels the culture — and that seems doubtful — if you want to imbibe the culture , you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in ."
There &apos;s no other way .
There &apos;s an interesting illustration of this .
"I have to go slightly obscure , but really you should seek it out ."
"Hi . So , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future ."
"His name is Nostradamus , although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I suspect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in precognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a fluke , and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine , and in this environment , it costs lives ."
"So firstly , thinking just about precognition , as it turns out , just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students , and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; Okay , well , fair enough , but I think that &apos;s a fluke , that &apos;s a freak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a journal ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study , and when they submitted it to the exact same journal , the journal said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interested in publishing replication . We &apos;re not interested in your negative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the academic literature , we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the dry academic field of psychology .
"It also happens in , for example , cancer research ."
"So in March , 2012 , just one month ago , some researchers reported in the journal Nature how they had tried to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer , and out of those 53 studies , they were only able to successfully replicate six ."
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable .
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published .
"People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occasions when it works they will publish , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem , because it is a problem , because it sends us all down blind alleys , their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science , and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research .
"It also happens in the very real , flesh and blood of academic medicine . So in 1980 , some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide , and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug , a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart attack , they &apos;re quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms , so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , this will increase the chances of them surviving ."
"Early on its development , they did a very small trial , just under a hundred patients ."
"Fifty patients got lorcainide , and of those patients , 10 died ."
"Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient , and only one of them died ."
"So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published ."
"Unfortunately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks ."
"These drugs were brought to market . They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs ."
"Now actually , in 1993 , the researchers who did that 1980 study , that early study , published a mea culpa , an apology to the scientific community , in which they said , &quot; &quot; When we carried out our study in 1980 , we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance . &quot; &quot; The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publication bias ."
"That &apos;s the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost , gets unpublished , is left missing in action , and they say the results described here &quot; might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead . &quot;"
Now these are stories from basic science .
"These are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The academic publishing environment is very different now .
"There are academic journals like &quot; &quot; Trials , &quot; &quot; the open access journal , which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result ."
But this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent . In fact it &apos;s so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine .
"So this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that I myself have prescribed . It &apos;s an antidepressant ."
"And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug . I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , I thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was misled . In fact , seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine against a dummy placebo sugar pill . One of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished ."
"Three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments , and those trials were not published ."
I felt misled .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extremely unusual example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry-picking and selective referencing that I &apos;m accusing other people of ."
"But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very , very well studied ."
So here is one example of how you approach it .
"The classic model is , you get a bunch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conducted and completed , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published anywhere in the academic literature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA ."
They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package .
"So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization ."
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer-reviewed academic literature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 50-50 split . Half of these trials were positive , half of them were negative , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"Only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published ."
"Now if we just flick back and forth between those two , you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors , patients , commissioners of health services , and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature ."
"We were misled , and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conducted on publication bias now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been collected in a systematic review , published in 2010 , that took every single study on publication bias that they could find ."
Publication bias affects every field of medicine .
"About half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings ."
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine .
"If I flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses , I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a two-headed coin .
That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence-based medicine .
"And to me , this is research misconduct ."
"If I conducted one study and I withheld half of the data points from that one study , you would rightly accuse me , essentially , of research fraud ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want , we don &apos;t consider that to be research misconduct ."
"And when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers , academics , industry sponsors , journal editors , for some reason we find it more acceptable , but the effect on patients is damning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a drug called Tamiflu . Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled Tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza ."
"Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death . ( Laughter ) Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not , they found that several of those trials were unpublished ."
The results were unavailable to them .
"And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means , through Freedom of Information Act requests , through harassing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent ."
"And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports , the 10,000-page long documents that have the best possible rendition of the information , they were told they weren &apos;t allowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company , you can see that written up in this week &apos;s edition of PLOS Medicine ."
"And the most staggering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suffer fake fixes ."
We &apos;ve had people pretend that this is a problem that &apos;s been fixed .
"First of all , we had trials registers , and everybody said , oh , it &apos;s okay . We &apos;ll get everyone to register their trials , they &apos;ll post the protocol , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then afterwards we &apos;ll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t bother to use those registers .
"And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along , and they said , oh , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t publish any journals , we won &apos;t publish any trials , unless they &apos;ve been registered before they began ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 2008 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren &apos;t properly registered , and a quarter of them weren &apos;t registered at all ."
"And then finally , the FDA Amendment Act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within one year ."
"And in the BMJ , in the first edition of January , 2012 , you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a disaster .
We cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fix .
"We need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans , including the older trials , because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years ."
"We need to publish all trials in humans , including the older trials , for all drugs in current use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Pull the knot .
"One is that I &apos;m always on time , and I &apos;m not ."
"I have four small children , and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness , but sometimes it &apos;s just not their fault ."
The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there .
"Sometimes I &apos;ll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines , generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day ."
You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise ?
"Don &apos;t watch two hours of TV a day , right ?"
"( Laughter ) Anyway , the idea is we &apos;ll save bits of time here and there , add it up , we will finally get to everything we want to do ."
We don &apos;t build the lives we want by saving time .
"We build the lives we want , and then time saves itself ."
Here &apos;s what I mean .
"If you &apos;ve ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a hugely damaging , frightening , sopping mess ."
All this is being recorded on her time log .
Winds up taking seven hours of her week .
Seven hours .
That &apos;s like finding an extra hour in the day .
&quot; Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people ? &quot;
And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic .
"We cannot make more time , but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it ."
And so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater .
"I remember it was a Thursday morning , and she was not available to speak with me ."
"Of course , right ?"
"But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike , because it was a beautiful spring morning , and she wanted to go for a hike ."
"So of course this makes me even more intrigued , and when I finally do catch up with her , she explains it like this ."
"And granted , there may be horrible consequences for making different choices , I will give you that ."
So how do we do that ?
"Well , first we need to figure out what they are ."
I want to give you two strategies for thinking about this .
"The first , on the professional side : I &apos;m sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting annual performance reviews ."
"You look back over your successes over the year , your &quot; &quot; opportunities for growth . &quot; &quot; And this serves its purpose , but I find it &apos;s more effective to do this looking forward ."
"You &apos;re giving yourself a performance review , and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally ."
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing ?
So you can write next year &apos;s performance review now .
"And you can do this for your personal life , too ."
"I &apos;m sure many of you , like me , come December , get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper , on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter ."
"But these letters serve a purpose , which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year ."
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing ?
So you can write next year &apos;s family holiday letter now .
Don &apos;t send it .
"( Laughter ) Please , don &apos;t send it ."
But you can write it .
"And now , between the performance review and the family holiday letter , we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year ."
And now we need to break these down into doable steps .
So maybe you want to write a family history .
Or maybe you want to run a 5K .
We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them .
I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons .
Friday afternoon is what an economist might call a &quot; &quot; low opportunity cost &quot; &quot; time .
Making a three-category list reminds us that there should be something in all three categories .
"Career , we think about ; relationships , self — not so much ."
"Then look out over the whole of the next week , and see where you can plan them in ."
Where you plan them in is up to you .
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others .
"I mean , some people &apos;s lives are just harder than others ."
It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own .
I get that .
And I don &apos;t want to minimize anyone &apos;s struggle .
But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering .
There are 168 hours in a week .
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours .
That is a lot of time .
"If you are working a full-time job , so 40 hours a week , sleeping eight hours a night , so 56 hours a week — that leaves 72 hours for other things ."
That is a lot of time .
"You say you &apos;re working 50 hours a week , maybe a main job and a side hustle ."
"Well , that leaves 62 hours for other things ."
You say you &apos;re working 60 hours .
"Well , that leaves 52 hours for other things ."
You say you &apos;re working more than 60 hours .
"Well , are you sure ?"
( Laughter ) There was once a study comparing people &apos;s estimated work weeks with time diaries .
And that &apos;s even if you &apos;re working way more than full-time hours .
We don &apos;t even need that much time to do amazing things .
"But when most of us have bits of time , what do we do ?"
"Pull out the phone , right ?"
Start deleting emails .
"Otherwise , we &apos;re puttering around the house or watching TV ."
But small moments can have great power .
You can use your bits of time for bits of joy .
Maybe it &apos;s choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work .
Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying .
"If family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule , maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute ."
It &apos;s about looking at the whole of one &apos;s time and seeing where the good stuff can go .
I truly believe this .
There is time .
"Even if we are busy , we have time for what matters ."
"And when we focus on what matters , we can build the lives we want in the time we &apos;ve got ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have a question : Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die ?
"I do . I was a young boy , and my grandfather had just died , and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened ."
What did it mean that he was dead ?
Where had he gone ?
It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him .
"But then the really shocking question occurred to me : If he could die , could it happen to me too ?"
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me ?
Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept ?
"Well , at some point , all children become aware of death ."
"It can happen in different ways , of course , and usually comes in stages ."
Our idea of death develops as we grow older .
"And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory , you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too , that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting ."
And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species .
"Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal , so at some point in the evolution of our species , some early human &apos;s sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize , &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot;"
"This is , if you like , our curse ."
It &apos;s the price we pay for being so damn clever .
"We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will , the end of all our projects , our hopes , our dreams , of our individual world ."
We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse .
And that &apos;s frightening . It &apos;s terrifying .
And so we look for a way out .
"And in my case , as I was about five years old , this meant asking my mum ."
"Now when I first started asking what happens when we die , the grown-ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half-hearted Christianity , and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now &quot; up there looking down on us , &quot; and if I should die too , which wouldn &apos;t happen of course , then I too would go up there , which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator ."
Now this didn &apos;t sound very plausible .
"I used to watch a children &apos;s news program at the time , and this was the era of space exploration ."
"There were always rockets going up into the sky , up into space , going up there ."
But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people .
"But I was scared , and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept ."
"And so I believed it anyway , even though it didn &apos;t make much sense ."
"And this thought process that I went through as a child , and have been through many times since , including as a grown-up , is a product of what psychologists call a bias ."
"Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong , ways in which we miscalculate , misjudge , distort reality , or see what we want to see , and the bias I &apos;m talking about works like this : Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn &apos;t true and they can , instead , live forever , even if it means taking the existential elevator ."
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all .
It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies .
"Now these studies are ingenious , but they &apos;re simple ."
They work like this .
"You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects , and you remind one group that they &apos;re going to die but not the other , then you compare their behavior ."
So you &apos;re observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality .
"And every time , you get the same result : People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever ."
"So here &apos;s an example : One recent study took two groups of agnostics , that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs ."
"Now , one group was asked to think about being dead ."
The other group was asked to think about being lonely .
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs .
Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus .
Twice as likely .
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic .
"But put the fear of death in them , and they run to Jesus ."
"Now , this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe , regardless of the evidence , and it works not just for religion , but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form , whether it &apos;s becoming famous or having children or even nationalism , which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole ."
This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history .
"Now , the theory behind this bias in the over 400 studies is called terror management theory , and the idea is simple . It &apos;s just this ."
"We develop our worldviews , that is , the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it , in order to help us manage the terror of death ."
"And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations , but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take ."
"And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history , just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day ."
"Now I &apos;m going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story , and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they &apos;re retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day ."
"Now , the first story is the simplest ."
"We want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever ."
"Ancient Egypt had such myths , ancient Babylon , ancient India ."
"Throughout European history , we find them in the work of the alchemists , and of course we still believe this today , only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science ."
"So 100 years ago , hormones had just been discovered , and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease , and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology ."
"But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir , a story that is as old as civilization ."
But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy .
"When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past , the one thing they now have in common is that they &apos;re all dead ."
"So we need a backup plan , and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers , and that &apos;s resurrection ."
"And it stays with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical organism ."
"It accepts that I &apos;m going to have to die but says , despite that , I can rise up and I can live again ."
"In other words , I can do what Jesus did ."
"Jesus died , he was three days in the &#91; tomb &#93; , and then he rose up and lived again ."
"And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe , not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims ."
"But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age , for example , with the idea of cryonics ."
"That &apos;s the idea that when you die , you can have yourself frozen , and then , at some point when technology has advanced enough , you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected ."
"And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again , and other people believe an omnipotent scientist will do it ."
"But for others , the whole idea of resurrection , of climbing out of the grave , it &apos;s just too much like a bad zombie movie ."
"They find the body too messy , too unreliable to guarantee eternal life , and so they set their hopes on the third , more spiritual immortality story , the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul ."
"Now , the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul , and the idea is central to many religions ."
"But even though , in its current form , in its traditional form , the idea of the soul is still hugely popular , nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age , for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind , your essence , the real you , onto a computer , and so live on as an avatar in the ether ."
"But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science , particularly neuroscience , it suggests that your mind , your essence , the real you , is very much dependent on a particular part of your body , that is , your brain ."
"And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story , and that is legacy , the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world , like the great Greek warrior Achilles , who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame ."
"And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was , and in our digital age , it &apos;s even easier to achieve ."
You don &apos;t need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero .
"All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat . ( Laughter ) But some people prefer to leave a more tangible , biological legacy — children , for example ."
"Or they like , they hope , to live on as part of some greater whole , a nation or a family or a tribe , their gene pool ."
"But again , there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality ."
"Woody Allen , for example , who said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen ."
"I want to live on in my apartment . &quot; &quot; So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories , and I &apos;ve tried to give just some sense of how they &apos;re retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day ."
"And the fact that they recur in this way , in such a similar form but in such different belief systems , suggests , I think , that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories ."
The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence .
"Rather , we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them , and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death ."
"So the question is , are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial , or can we overcome this bias ?"
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could .
"He argued that the fear of death is natural , but it is not rational ."
"&quot; &quot; Death , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; is nothing to us , because when we are here , death is not , and when death is here , we are gone . &quot; &quot; Now this is often quoted , but it &apos;s difficult to really grasp , to really internalize , because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine ."
"So 2,000 years later , another philosopher , Ludwig Wittgenstein , put it like this : &quot; &quot; Death is not an event in life : We do not live to experience death ."
"And so , &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; in this sense , life has no end . &quot;"
"So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void , but it wasn &apos;t rational , because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience ."
"Now , overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us , yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational , and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us , then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives ."
"Now , I find it helps to see life as being like a book : Just as a book is bounded by its covers , by beginning and end , so our lives are bounded by birth and death , and even though a book is limited by beginning and end , it can encompass distant landscapes , exotic figures , fantastic adventures ."
"And even though a book is limited by beginning and end , the characters within it know no horizons ."
"They only know the moments that make up their story , even when the book is closed ."
And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page .
Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of &quot; &quot; Treasure Island . &quot; &quot; And so it should be with us .
"Imagine the book of your life , its covers , its beginning and end , and your birth and your death ."
"You can only know the moments in between , the moments that make up your life ."
"It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers , whether before your birth or after your death ."
"And you needn &apos;t worry how long the book is , or whether it &apos;s a comic strip or an epic ."
The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story .
Thank you .

The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking .
And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor .
"Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter , and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago ."
"However , only recently , due to several technological advancements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking ."
"So , a superconductor is defined by two properties ."
"The first is zero electrical resistance , and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor ."
"That sounds complicated , right ?"
But what is electrical resistance ?
"So , electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material ."
"And these electrons , while flowing , they collide with the atoms , and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat , and you know that effect ."
"However , inside a superconductor there are no collisions , so there is no energy dissipation ."
It &apos;s quite remarkable . Think about it .
"In classical physics , there is always some friction , some energy loss ."
"But not here , because it is a quantum effect ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because superconductors don &apos;t like magnetic fields ."
"So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by circulating currents ."
"Now , the combination of both effects — the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance — is exactly a superconductor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always perfect , as we all know , and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor ."
"Now , under proper conditions , which we have here , these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor ."
"And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in discrete quantities ."
Why ? Because it is a quantum phenomenon . It &apos;s quantum physics .
And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles .
"In this movie here , you can see how they flow one by one discretely ."
"This is strands of magnetic field . These are not particles , but they behave like particles ."
"So , this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking ."
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
"Well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their movements dissipate energy , which breaks the superconductivity state ."
"So what it actually does , it locks these strands , which are called fluxons , and it locks these fluxons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is locking itself in place ."
"Why ? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their configuration ."
So we get quantum locking . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a superconductor , which I wrapped up so it &apos;d stay cold long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a regular magnet , it just stays locked in midair ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just levitation . It &apos;s not just repulsion ."
"I can rearrange the fluxons , and it will be locked in this new configuration ."
"Like this , or move it slightly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quantum locking — actually locking — three-dimensional locking of the superconductor ."
"Of course , I can turn it upside down , and it will remain locked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking , Yeah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet ."
"Why ? Because as long as it rotates , the locking is maintained ."
You see ? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor .
"We have frictionless motion . It is still levitating , but can move freely all around ."
"So , we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet ."
"But how many fluxons , how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this ?"
"Well , we can calculate it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk .
"But that &apos;s not the amazing part yet , because there is something I haven &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , yeah , the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick . It &apos;s extremely thin ."
"And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight ."
It &apos;s a remarkable effect . It &apos;s very strong .
"Now , I can extend this circular magnet , and make whatever track I want ."
"For example , I can make a large circular rail here ."
"And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail , it moves freely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can adjust its position like this , and rotate , and it freely moves in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this disk and put it here , and while it stays here — don &apos;t move — I will try to rotate the track , and hopefully , if I did it correctly , it stays suspended ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quantum locking , not levitation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it circulate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconductors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields , such as needed in MRI machines , particle accelerators and so on ."
"But we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation ."
"And we could also produce power cables , to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations ."
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable .
But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand , three-inch diameter , with a single difference ."
"The superconducting layer , instead of being half a micron thin , being two millimeters thin , quite thin ."
"This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms , a small car , in my hand ."
Amazing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer ."
"My topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?"
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
"I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine .
"I had my first apartment , my first little green American Express card , and I had a very big secret ."
"My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate , many , many times ."
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
"I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School ."
"I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson , Leo Burnett and The Washington Post ."
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
"My dog is a black lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan ."
"( Laughter ) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all races , all religions , all income and education levels ."
It &apos;s everywhere .
"And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue ."
Not exactly .
"Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing ."
"I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age ."
"I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States ."
"I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns ."
"I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night ."
"He sat next to me on the New York City subway , and he started chatting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just graduated from an Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank ."
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
"He had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair , and he seemed so sweet ."
"One of the smartest things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship ."
He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
"We started dating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
"Conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life ."
Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
"Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot; &quot; Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me ,"
"because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so I agreed , and I quit my job , and Conor and I left Manhattan together ."
"I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap ."
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
"As soon as we moved to New England — you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe — he bought three guns ."
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
"He kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times ."
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
"But those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day ."
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown .
"I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall ."
"Five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I married him ."
"Despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much ."
"And he was very , very sorry ."
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
"It was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again ."
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
"The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window ."
"And then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face ."
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
"One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good company ."
Back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
"Even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife ."
"Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons ."
"The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
"To me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser ."
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
"Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose ."
"Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
"I was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial ."
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
"I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me ."
"We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot; &quot; is code for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us ."
"But since publishing &quot; &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives — joyous , happy lives — as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
"I remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black lab , and I have that minivan ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me ."
"Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
"Abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now ."
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
"It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you ."
Talk about what you heard here .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
"Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family ."
"Recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures ."
"Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out ."
"Together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be ."
Thank you .

One billion people .
Those are the problems in the developing world .
And it &apos;s easy for us not to be empathetic with those people who seem so distanced from us .
We see that in the Sanders / Trump campaigns in my own country .
"We &apos;ve been working on this problem for 25 years , since Rio , the Kyoto Protocols ."
"Our most recent move is the Paris treaty , and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world ."
"I think we can be very hopeful that those agreements , which are bottom-up agreements , where nations have said what they think they can do , are genuine and forthcoming for the vast majority of the parties ."
"The unfortunate thing is that now , as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield , the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear ."
It shows basically CO2 emissions around the world over the next 30 years .
There are three things that you need to look at and appreciate .
"In order to control climate , CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero because it &apos;s the cumulative emissions that drive heating on the planet ."
This should tell you that we are losing the race to fossil fuels .
"The second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries , from China , from India , from the rest of the world , which includes South Africa and Indonesia and Brazil , as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted in the developed world ."
"The final thing that you should notice is that each year , about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet &apos;s atmosphere , and then diffusing into the ocean and into the land ."
That &apos;s on top of the 550 gigatons that are in place today .
"At the end of 30 years , we will have put 850 gigatons of carbon into the air , and that probably goes a long way towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase in global mean surface temperatures , locking in ocean acidification and locking in sea level rise ."
"Now , this is a projection made by men by the actions of society , and it &apos;s ours to change , not to accept ."
It &apos;s a function of their natural resources .
It &apos;s a function of the development path that they &apos;ve followed as a society .
It &apos;s a function of where on the surface of the planet they are .
"Many , many , many things go into the choices of countries , and they each make a different choice ."
The overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate is the choice that China has made .
"China has made the choice , and will make the choice , to run on coal ."
The United States has an alternative .
China has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe .
"If you look at China , and you ask yourself why has coal been important to it , you have to remember what China &apos;s done ."
"China brought people to power , not power to people ."
It didn &apos;t do rural electrification .
It urbanized .
"It urbanized by taking low-cost labor and low-cost energy , creating export industries that could fund a tremendous amount of growth ."
"If we look at China &apos;s path , all of us know that prosperity in China has dramatically increased ."
"In 1980 , 80 percent of China &apos;s population lived below the extreme poverty level , below the level of having $ 1.90 per person per day ."
"Right now , we &apos;re basically waiting for a miracle ."
"If they can &apos;t make it safe , if they can &apos;t make it cheap , it should not be deployed ."
( Applause )
"This , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occur to anyone to question it ."
This is my supermarket .
"One consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke ."
"We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones ."
These are cell phones of the future .
"My favorite is the middle one — the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and crème brûlée torch ."
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
Third : escalation of expectations .
You want button fly or zipper fly ? You want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
"I had very low , no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor ."
I couldn &apos;t have done better .
"With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure ."
"And so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse ."
So let me remind you .
There &apos;s some magical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness these days .
"There is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers ."
There is a lot of happiness coaching .
Everybody would like to make people happier .
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
"This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is ."
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real cognitive trap ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound ."
"And then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience ."
But it hadn &apos;t .
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
"They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep ."
"There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present ."
"It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches — you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness ."
"Now , the remembering self is a storyteller ."
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories — it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me begin with one example .
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
"Here are two patients , those are their recordings ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"Clearly , Patient B suffered more — his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
And here is a surprise .
The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
"The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends ."
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great — but one of them is this distinct ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;"
"And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory ."
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
"From the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time ."
"Now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much ."
"That will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings ."
"Endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated ."
"Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously ."
"It has moments of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really straightforward : They are lost forever .
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
"And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
"And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us ."
"From the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
"We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences ."
We think of our future as anticipated memories .
"I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self ."
And this is a bit hard to justify I think .
"I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?"
That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
"Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half ."
There seems to be a discrepancy .
"Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"Imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything ."
Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness ."
"There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
"And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time ."
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
Very different notion .
"Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way ."
"The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately ."
"So in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"Just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 ."
"What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his height ?"
You have that much uncertainty .
So the correlation is low .
We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , goals are very important ."
"We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like ."
"There are other pleasures , but this is dominant ."
The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
It is a completely different notion .
"Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer ."
"Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey ."
"When we looked at how feelings , vary with income ."
"And it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans — and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample — below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ..."
"CA : 60,000 ."
"DK : 60,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get ."
"Above that , we get an absolutely flat line ."
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
"Clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you earn , the more satisfied you are ."
That does not hold for emotions .
"CA : But Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness ."
"If people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth ."
People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
"This is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics ."
"CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at least should be — the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a varied talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to spin a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a convenient starting place ."
"The talk will be broadly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
"You take about eight or so carbon atoms , about 20 hydrogen atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid : very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little pocket map of where it &apos;s all located .
A bigger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the oil in the world ."
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
This is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"Oh , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1000 meters below where you &apos;re all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world ."
"Come talk to me about it , I &apos;ll fill in some of the details if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about oil ? Where is it in the energy system ?
"Here &apos;s a little snapshot of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little secret I &apos;m going to tell you about : For the last 25 years , oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems ."
"There was one kind of peak oil in 1985 , when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 35 percent ."
It &apos;s been declining and I believe it will continue to decline .
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining .
So oil is playing a less significant role every year .
"And so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 1920s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
And what &apos;s been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?
"Well , a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear , for starters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas , and beyond that , peak renewables ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pretending that energy use in total isn &apos;t increasing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . Come talk to me about it , we &apos;ll fill in some of the details — but there &apos;s a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been systematically decarbonizing our energy system ."
"Energy systems of the world becoming progressively — year on year , decade on decade , century on century — becoming less carbon intense ."
"And that continues into the future with the renewables that we &apos;re developing today , reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — Okay , we just replace it all with conventional renewables — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond .
"What is the future of truly sustainable , carbon-free energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little excursion , and we &apos;ll start in central Texas ."
Here &apos;s a piece of limestone .
"I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas ."
It &apos;s about 400 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of chalk ."
I picked this up at MIT . It &apos;s a little younger .
"And it &apos;s different than this limestone , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this ."
"Yeah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : calcium carbonate , calcium carbonate ."
What &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of neat , the story gets really neat right now ."
Off the coast of California comes this : It &apos;s an abalone shell .
"Now , millions of abalone every year make this shell ."
"Oh , by the way , just in case you weren &apos;t already guessing , it &apos;s calcium carbonate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this ."
"And why ? Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers , making this beautiful , iridescent mother of pearl ."
"Very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredible stuff .
"All the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the molecules are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of coal .
And I &apos;ll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about fuels or energy carriers , or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells , nature hasn &apos;t ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"Nature didn &apos;t need to because , unlike the abalone shell , the survival of a species didn &apos;t depend on building those materials , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently ."
And so that is my story .
The oil will never run out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a bajillion windmills .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas — they had ideas , innovations , technology — and the Stone Age ended , not because we ran out of stones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s innovation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we run out of oil ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"It &apos;s like a coin flip ; it doesn &apos;t count , really ."
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
And I think some people may have misunderstood .
That &apos;s the way evolution works .
"Now , maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical ."
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both challenged and excited .
My excitement is : I get a chance to give something back .
My challenge is : the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;m not exaggerating . I do weekends — I do more , obviously , I also coach people — but I &apos;m into immersion , because how did you learn language ?"
"Not just by learning principles , you got in it and you did it so often that it became real ."
"The bottom line of why I &apos;m here , besides being a crazy mofo , is that — I &apos;m not here to motivate you , you don &apos;t need that , obviously ."
"Often that &apos;s what people think I do , and it &apos;s the furthest thing from it ."
"What happens , though , is people say to me , &quot; I don &apos;t need any motivation . &quot;"
But that &apos;s not what I do .
I &apos;m the &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; guy .
I want to know why you do what you do .
What is your motive for action ?
What is it that drives you in your life today ? Not 10 years ago .
Are you running the same pattern ?
"Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive , activated , is the most important thing ."
I &apos;m here because I believe emotion is the force of life .
All of us here have great minds .
"Most of us here have great minds , right ?"
We all know how to think .
With our minds we can rationalize anything .
We can make anything happen .
"I agree with what was described a few days ago , that people work in their self-interest ."
But we know that that &apos;s bullshit at times .
"You don &apos;t work in your self-interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wiring changes in the way it functions ."
"So it &apos;s wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is , especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head ."
But I really want to know what &apos;s driving you .
One : so that you can contribute more .
I &apos;ve got to do something right now or nothing matters .
"I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide , I &apos;ve got to do something ."
"In 29 years , I &apos;m very grateful to tell you I &apos;ve never lost one ."
"When I get those calls about performance , that &apos;s one thing ."
How do you make a change ?
"I &apos;m also looking to see what is shaping the person &apos;s ability to contribute , to do something beyond themselves ."
"Maybe the real question is , I look at life and say there &apos;s two master lessons ."
"One is : there &apos;s the science of achievement , which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly ."
"&quot; How do you take the invisible and make it visible , &quot; How do you make your dreams happen ?"
"Once you know the game , you just up the ante , don &apos;t you ?"
But when it comes to fulfillment — that &apos;s an art .
"The reason is , it &apos;s about appreciation and contribution ."
You can only feel so much by yourself .
I &apos;ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody &apos;s life changes if you look at them like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ?
Like all the resources they say they need .
"You gave not a 100-dollar computer , but the best computer ."
"You gave them love , joy , were there to comfort them ."
What is it that shapes us ?
We live in a therapy culture .
"And you wouldn &apos;t be in this room if you bought that , but most of society thinks biography is destiny ."
Of course it does if you live there .
We &apos;ve got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power .
"When you ask people , have you failed to achieve something significant in your life ?"
"Say , &quot; &quot; Aye . &quot; &quot; Audience : Aye ."
TR : Thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achieve something ?"
"Somebody who &apos;s working for you , or a partner , or even yourself ."
"When you fail to achieve , what &apos;s the reason people say ?"
What do they tell you ?
"Didn &apos;t have the knowledge , didn &apos;t have the money , didn &apos;t have the time , didn &apos;t have the technology ."
I didn &apos;t have the right manager .
Al Gore : Supreme Court . TR : The Supreme Court .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Cheering ) ( Applause continues ) TR : And — ( Applause ) What do all those , including the Supreme Court , have in common ? ( Laughter )"
"They are a claim to you missing resources , and they may be accurate ."
"You may not have the money , or the Supreme Court , but that is not the defining factor ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you correct me if I &apos;m wrong .
The defining factor is never resources ; it &apos;s resourcefulness .
"And what I mean specifically , rather than just some phrase , is if you have emotion , human emotion , something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I &apos;ve ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won ."
Audience : Yeah !
( Applause ) ( Cheering ) How easy for me to tell him what he should do .
"But I know when we watched the debate at that time , there were emotions that blocked people &apos;s ability to get this man &apos;s intellect and capacity ."
But there was emotion there .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
"Say , &quot; &quot; Aye . &quot; &quot; Audience : Aye ."
"TR : So , emotion is it ."
"And if we get the right emotion , we can get ourselves to do anything ."
"If you &apos;re creative , playful , fun enough , can you get through to anybody , yes or no ?"
"He &apos;s broken my pattern , that son-of-a-bitch ."
"( Laughter ) But I appreciated the energy , I &apos;ll tell you that . ( Laughter )"
What determines your resources ?
"If decisions shape destiny , what determines it is three decisions ."
What will you focus on ?
You have to decide what you &apos;re going to focus on .
Consciously or unconsciously .
"the minute you decide to focus , you must give it a meaning , and that meaning produces emotion ."
Is this the end or the beginning ?
"Is God punishing me or rewarding me , or is this the roll of the dice ?"
"An emotion creates what we &apos;re going to do , or the action ."
But what was his decision of what to focus on ?
Different than most people . What did it mean ?
It wasn &apos;t the end ; it was the beginning .
"He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer , because he got emotional fitness , psychological strength ."
That &apos;s the difference in human beings that I &apos;ve seen of the three million I &apos;ve been around .
"In my lab , I &apos;ve had three million people from 80 countries over the last 29 years ."
"And after a while , patterns become obvious ."
"You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way , right ?"
"Others say , &quot; &quot; Oh , that sounds ridiculous . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s simple ."
"So , what shaped Lance ? What shapes you ?"
Two invisible forces . Very quickly . One : state .
"We all have had times , you did something , and after , you thought to yourself , &quot; I can &apos;t believe I said or did that , that was so stupid . &quot;"
"Who &apos;s been there ? Say , &quot; &quot; Aye . &quot; &quot; Audience : Aye ."
"Or after you did something , you go , &quot; &quot; That was me ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It wasn &apos;t your ability ; it was your state ."
Your model of the world is what shapes you long term .
Your model of the world is the filter . That &apos;s what &apos;s shaping us .
It makes people make decisions .
"To influence somebody , we need to know what already influences them ."
It &apos;s made up of three parts .
"Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought , is this all there is ?"
"Say , &quot; &quot; Aye . &quot; &quot; Audience : Aye ."
It &apos;s needs we have . I believe there are six human needs .
"Second , once you know what the target that &apos;s driving you is and you uncover it for the truth — you don &apos;t form it — then you find out what &apos;s your map , what &apos;s the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs ."
Control everybody ? Develop a skill ? Give up ? Smoke a cigarette ?
"And if you got totally certain , ironically , even though we need that — you &apos;re not certain about your health , or your children , or money ."
"If you &apos;re not sure the ceiling will hold up , you won &apos;t listen to any speaker ."
"While we go for certainty differently , if we get total certainty , we get what ?"
"You know what will happen , when and how it will happen , what would you feel ?"
"Bored out of your minds . So , God , in Her infinite wisdom , gave us a second human need , which is uncertainty ."
We need variety . We need surprise .
"How many of you here love surprises ? Say , &quot; &quot; Aye . &quot; &quot; Audience : Aye ."
TR : Bullshit . You like the surprises you want .
Have you ever rented a video or a film that you &apos;ve already seen ?
Who &apos;s done this ? Get a fucking life .
Whatever it takes .
"If I put a gun to your head and I live in the &apos; hood , instantly I &apos;m significant ."
Zero to 10 . How high ? 10 .
How certain am I that you &apos;re going to respond to me ? 10 .
How much uncertainty ?
Who knows what &apos;s going to happen next ? Kind of exciting .
Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there .
Total variety and uncertainty .
"And it &apos;s significant , isn &apos;t it ? So you want to risk your life for it ."
So that &apos;s why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species .
"You can get significance a million ways , but to be significant , you &apos;ve got to be unique and different ."
"Here &apos;s what we really need : connection and love , fourth need ."
Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship ?
"If you don &apos;t raise your hand , you &apos;ve had other shit , too ."
And you &apos;re going to get hurt again .
Aren &apos;t you glad you came to this positive visit ?
Here &apos;s what &apos;s true : we need it .
"We can do it through intimacy , friendship , prayer , through walking in nature ."
"If nothing else works for you , don &apos;t get a cat , get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone six months , when you come back 5 minutes later ."
"These first four needs , every human finds a way to meet ."
"Even if you lie to yourself , you need to have split personalities ."
I call the first four needs the needs of the personality .
The last two are the needs of the spirit .
And this is where fulfillment comes .
You won &apos;t get it from the first four .
"You &apos;ll figure a way , smoke , drink , do whatever , meet the first four ."
"But number five , you must grow ."
"If you don &apos;t grow , you &apos;re what ?"
"If a relationship or business is not growing , if you &apos;re not growing , doesn &apos;t matter how much money or friends you have , how many love you , you feel like hell ."
Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves .
"Because we all know , corny as that sounds , the secret to living is giving ."
"We all know life is not about me , it &apos;s about we ."
"This culture knows that , this room knows that ."
"You can feel the difference in him , and it &apos;s beautiful ."
And that calling can touch other people .
"My life was touched because when I was 11 years old , Thanksgiving , no money , no food , we were not going to starve , but my father was totally messed up , my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up , and somebody came to the door and delivered food ."
"My father made three decisions , I know what they were , briefly ."
His focus was &quot; &quot; This is charity .
What does it mean ? I &apos;m worthless .
"What do I have to do ? Leave my family , &quot; &quot; which he did ."
It was one of the most painful experiences of life .
My three decisions gave me a different path .
I set focus on &quot; &quot; There &apos;s food . &quot; &quot; What a concept !
"( Laughter ) But this is what changed my life , shaped me as a human being ."
"Somebody &apos;s gift , I don &apos;t even know who it is ."
"My father always said , &quot; &quot; No one gives a shit . &quot; &quot; And now somebody I don &apos;t know , they &apos;re not asking for anything , just giving us food , looking out for us ."
It made me believe this : that strangers care .
"And that made me decide , if strangers care about me and my family , I care about them ."
I &apos;m going to do something to make a difference .
"So when I was 17 , I went out on Thanksgiving , it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families ."
The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life .
"Next year , I did four , then eight ."
"I didn &apos;t tell anybody what I was doing , I wasn &apos;t doing it for brownie points ."
"But after eight , I thought I could use some help ."
"So I went out , got my friends involved , then I grew companies , got 11 , and I built the foundation ."
"18 years later , I &apos;m proud to tell you last year we fed 2 million people in 35 countries through our foundation ."
"All during the holidays , Thanksgiving , Christmas , in different countries around the world ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"I don &apos;t tell you that to brag , but because I &apos;m proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they &apos;ve had the chance to experience it , not talk about it ."
"So , finally — I &apos;m about out of time ."
The target that shapes you — Here &apos;s what &apos;s different about people .
We have the same needs .
"But are you a certainty freak , is that what you value most , or uncertainty ?"
This man couldn &apos;t be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves .
Are you driven by significance or love ?
"And as you move in a direction , you have a destination or destiny ."
They want to honor God or honor their family .
The last piece is emotion .
One of the parts of the map is like time .
Some people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years .
"Somebody else &apos;s is three seconds , which is what I have ."
And the last one I &apos;ve already mentioned that fell to you .
You use this thing and you don &apos;t get there .
Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go .
( Laughter ) The last thing is emotion .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;ll tell you about emotion .
"There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for in the English language , which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language ."
"But if your dominant emotions — If I have 20,000 people or 1,000 and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week , and I give them as long as they need , and on one side they write empowering emotions , the other &apos;s disempowering , guess how many emotions they experience ? Less than 12 ."
And half of those make them feel like shit .
They have six good feelings .
"Happy , happy , excited , oh shit , frustrated , frustrated , overwhelmed , depressed ."
"How many of you know somebody who , no matter what happens , finds a way to get pissed off ?"
"( Laughter ) Or no matter what happens , they find a way to be happy or excited ."
How many of you know somebody like this ?
"When 9 / 11 happened , I &apos;ll finish with this , I was in Hawaii ."
"I got up , had no plan for this , and I said — we had fireworks , I do crazy shit , fun stuff , and at the end , I stopped ."
"I had this plan , but I never know what I &apos;m going to say ."
"And all of a sudden , I said , &quot; When do people really start to live ? When they face death . &quot;"
"And I went through this whole thing about , if you weren &apos;t going to get off this island , if nine days from now , you were going to die , who would you call , what would you say , what would you do ?"
That night is when 9 / 11 happened .
"One woman had come to the seminar , and when she came there , her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered ."
"Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her , and she said no ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; If you go to that Hawaii thing , it &apos;s over with us . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s over . &quot; &quot; When I finished that night , she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked , saying , &quot; &quot; I love you , I want you to know I want to marry you ."
"It was stupid of me . &quot; &quot; She was asleep , because it was 3 a.m. for us , when he called her back , and said , &quot; &quot; Honey , I can &apos;t tell you what this means ."
"I don &apos;t know how to tell you this , but you gave me the greatest gift , because I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And she played the recording for us in the room ."
She was on Larry King later .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice ."
All I can say is this must be God &apos;s message to you .
"From now on , every day , give your all , love your all ."
"Don &apos;t let anything ever stop you . &quot; &quot; She finishes , and a man stands up , and he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Pakistan , I &apos;m a Muslim ."
"I &apos;d love to hold your hand and say I &apos;m sorry , but frankly , this is retribution . &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell you the rest , because I &apos;m out of time ."
( Laughter ) Are you sure ? ( Laughter )
10 seconds !
"( Laughter and applause ) 10 seconds , I want to be respectful ."
"All I can tell you is , I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center , because I had about 200 New Yorkers there ."
"More than 50 lost their entire companies , friends , marking off their Palm Pilots ."
"One financial trader , woman made of steel , bawling — 30 friends crossing off that all died ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What are we going to focus on ?"
"What does this mean and what are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; And I got the group to focus on : if you didn &apos;t lose somebody today , your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else ."
"Then one woman stood up and was so angry , screaming and yelling ."
"I found out she wasn &apos;t from New York , she &apos;s not an American , doesn &apos;t know anybody here ."
"And secondly , so you can appreciate — not just understand , that &apos;s intellectual , that &apos;s the mind , but appreciate what &apos;s driving other people ."
"God bless you , thank you . I hope this was of service ."

( Music ) Text : BeatJazz .
"BeatJazz is : 1 . Live looping , 2 . Jazz improvisation And 3 . &quot; &quot; Gestural &quot; &quot; sound design ."
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
The color of the lights indicates which sound I am playing .
"Red = Drums , Blue = Bass , Green = Chords , Orange = Leads , Purple = Pads The mouthpiece consists of ..."
"a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue ."
The heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters .
Why ?
"To atomize music culture so that ALL past , present and future genres can be studied and abstracted , live ."
And &quot; BeatJazzers &quot; become as common as D.J. &apos; s .
But mostly ...
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it .

Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
"In my own humanity and mistakes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
There &apos;s something that I &apos;d like you to see .
"( Video ) Reporter : It &apos;s a story that &apos;s deeply unsettled millions in China : footage of a two-year-old girl hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby , footage too graphic to be shown ."
The entire accident is caught on camera .
"The driver pauses after hitting the child , his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second ."
"Within two minutes , three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by ."
The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely .
Others look at her before moving off .
"She was rushed to hospital , but it was too late . She died ."
"I wonder how many of you , looking at that , said to yourselves just now , &quot; &quot; I would not have done that ."
I would have stopped to help . &quot; &quot; Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you .
"As I thought , that &apos;s most of you ."
"But before you give yourself too much credit , look at this ."
"UNICEF reports that in 2011 , 6.9 million children under five died from preventable , poverty-related diseases ."
UNICEF thinks that that &apos;s good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from 12 million in 1990 . That is good .
"But still , 6.9 million is 19,000 children dying every day ."
Does it really matter that we &apos;re not walking past them in the street ?
Does it really matter that they &apos;re far away ?
I don &apos;t think it does make a morally relevant difference .
"The fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different nationality or race , none of that seems morally relevant to me ."
"What is really important is , can we reduce that death toll ? Can we save some of those 19,000 children dying every day ?"
"And the answer is , yes we can ."
Each of us spends money on things that we do not really need .
"You can think what your own habit is , whether it &apos;s a new car , a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink ."
"You could take the money you &apos;re spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization , the Against Malaria Foundation , which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one , and we know reliably that if we provide nets , they &apos;re used , and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria , just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those 19,000 children dying every day ."
"Fortunately , more and more people are understanding this idea , and the result is a growing movement : effective altruism ."
It &apos;s important because it combines both the heart and the head .
"The heart , of course , you felt ."
You felt the empathy for that child .
"But it &apos;s really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed , and not only that , but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people , wherever they are , are like us , that they can suffer as we can , that parents grieve for the deaths of their children , as we do , and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us , it matters just as much to all of these people ."
So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want .
It does help us to put perspective on our situation .
And I think that &apos;s why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math .
"And that might seem surprising , because a lot of people think , &quot; &quot; Philosophy is remote from the real world ; economics , we &apos;re told , just makes us more selfish , and we know that math is for nerds . &quot; &quot; But in fact it does make a difference , and in fact there &apos;s one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this ."
"This is the website of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , and if you look at the words on the top right-hand side , it says , &quot; &quot; All lives have equal value . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the understanding , the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history , Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett ."
"( Applause ) No one , not Andrew Carnegie , not John D. Rockefeller , has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three , and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective ."
"According to one estimate , the Gates Foundation has already saved 5.8 million lives and many millions more , people , getting diseases that would have made them very sick , even if eventually they survived ."
"Over the coming years , undoubtably the Gates Foundation is going to give a lot more , is going to save a lot more lives ."
"Well , you might say , that &apos;s fine if you &apos;re a billionaire , you can have that kind of impact ."
"But if I &apos;m not , what can I do ?"
So I &apos;m going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving .
They worry how much of a difference they can make .
"He became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career , an academic career , he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living ."
Toby himself does better than that .
"He &apos;s pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year — that &apos;s less than 30,000 dollars — and to give the rest to those organizations ."
"And yes , Toby is married and he does have a mortgage ."
"And then , as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement , they returned to them , and they &apos;ve decided to cut back on their spending , to live modestly , and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty ."
"Now , mentioning time might lead you to think , &quot; &quot; Well , should I abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these 19,000 lives that are lost every day ? &quot; &quot; One person who &apos;s thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch ."
"He &apos;s a graduate student in philosophy , and he &apos;s set up a website called 80,000 Hours , the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career , to advise people on how to have the best , most effective career ."
"But you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider , if they have the right abilities and character , is to go into banking or finance ."
"Why ? Because if you earn a lot of money , you can give away a lot of money , and if you &apos;re successful in that career , you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ , let &apos;s say , five aid workers in developing countries , and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done ."
Here &apos;s one young man who &apos;s taken this advice .
His name is Matt Weiger .
"He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math , actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated ."
But he &apos;s gone into finance in New York .
He &apos;s already earning enough so that he &apos;s giving a six-figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on .
"Matt has also helped me to set up an organization that I &apos;m working with that has the name taken from the title of a book I wrote , &quot; The Life You Can Save , &quot; which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we &apos;re going to live an ethical life , it &apos;s not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots and not cheat , steal , maim , kill , but that if we have enough , we have to share some of that with people who have so little ."
"And the organization draws together people of different generations , like Holly Morgan , who &apos;s an undergraduate , who &apos;s pledged to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has , and on the right , Ada Wan , who has worked directly for the poor , but has now gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give ."
"Many people will think , though , that charities aren &apos;t really all that effective ."
So let &apos;s talk about effectiveness .
"Toby Ord is very concerned about this , and he &apos;s calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others , so it &apos;s very important to find the effective ones ."
"Take , for example , providing a guide dog for a blind person ."
"That &apos;s a good thing to do , right ?"
"Well , right , it is a good thing to do , but you have to think what else you could do with the resources ."
It costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma .
"So you do the sums , and you get something like that ."
"You could provide one guide dog for one blind American , or you could cure between 400 and 2,000 people of blindness ."
I think it &apos;s clear what &apos;s the better thing to do .
"But if you want to look for effective charities , this is a good website to go to ."
"GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities , not just whether they &apos;re well-run , and it &apos;s screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three , of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one ."
"So it &apos;s very tough . If you want to look for other recommendations , thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can both have a somewhat broader list , but you can find effective organizations , and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor ."
I &apos;m pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations .
"That &apos;s another cause that I &apos;ve been concerned about all my life , the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year ."
"So if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering , you can go to Effective Animal Activism ."
And some effective altruists think it &apos;s very important to make sure that our species survives at all .
So they &apos;re looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction .
"Here &apos;s one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently , when an asteroid passed close to our planet ."
"Possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us , but actually to deflect them ."
So some people think that would be a good thing to give to .
There &apos;s many possibilities .
"My final question is , some people will think it &apos;s a burden to give ."
I don &apos;t really believe it is .
I &apos;ve enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student .
It &apos;s been something fulfilling to me .
Charlie Bresler said to me that he &apos;s not an altruist .
He thinks that the life he &apos;s saving is his own .
"And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism , and now is one of the happiest people she knows ."
I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem .
"Here &apos;s Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian , condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill ."
"Just as he gets there , the effort becomes too much , the boulder escapes , rolls all the way down the hill , he has to trudge back down to push it up again , and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity ."
"Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle , where you work hard to get money , you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you &apos;ll enjoy using ?"
"But then the money &apos;s gone , you have to work hard to get more , spend more , and to maintain the same level of happiness , it &apos;s kind of a hedonic treadmill ."
"You never get off , and you never really feel satisfied ."
Becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment .
It enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living .
I &apos;m going to conclude by telling you about an email that I received while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago .
"It &apos;s from a man named Chris Croy , who I &apos;d never heard of ."
This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery .
Why was he recovering from surgery ?
"The email began , &quot; &quot; Last Tuesday , I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger ."
That started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s about 100 people each year in the U.S.
and more in other countries who do that .
I was pleased to read it . Chris went on to say that he &apos;d been influenced by my writings in what he did .
"Well , I have to admit , I &apos;m also somewhat embarrassed by that , because I still have two kidneys ."
"And that did make me feel a little bit better , because I have given more than 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation and to various other effective charities ."
"So if you &apos;re feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well , there &apos;s a way for you to get off the hook ."
Thank you .

"Our mission is to build a detailed , realistic computer model of the human brain ."
"And we &apos;ve done , in the past four years , a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain , and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain ."
Why are we doing this ?
There are three important reasons .
"The first is , it &apos;s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and I think that it is a key step in evolution ."
"The second reason is , we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever , and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model ."
It &apos;s like a Noah &apos;s Ark . It &apos;s like an archive .
"And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder , and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical ."
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders .
"Now , even at this stage , we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works ."
"And here , at TED , for the first time , I &apos;d like to share with you how we &apos;re addressing one theory — there are many theories — one theory of how the brain works ."
"So , this theory is that the brain creates , builds , a version of the universe , and projects this version of the universe , like a bubble , all around us ."
"Now , this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries ."
"But , for the first time , we can actually address this , with brain simulation , and ask very systematic and rigorous questions , whether this theory could possibly be true ."
"The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers ."
It runs out of space .
"And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble , and we make a decision ."
"We make a decision it &apos;s that big , even though it &apos;s not that big ."
And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble . It keeps it alive .
"Without decisions you cannot see , you cannot think , you cannot feel ."
"And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep , or by blocking your receptors so that you don &apos;t feel pain , but in fact most anesthetics don &apos;t work that way ."
What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other .
"They are confused , and you cannot make a decision ."
"So , while you &apos;re trying to make up your mind what the doctor , the surgeon , is doing while he &apos;s hacking away at your body , he &apos;s long gone ."
He &apos;s at home having tea .
"( Laughter ) So , when you walk up to a door and you open it , what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions , thousands of decisions about the size of the room , the walls , the height , the objects in this room ."
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .
It is what you infer about that room .
"So I can say , with some certainty , &quot; I think , therefore I am . &quot;"
"But I cannot say , &quot; &quot; You think , therefore you are , &quot; &quot; because &quot; &quot; you &quot; &quot; are within my perceptual bubble ."
"Now , we can speculate and philosophize this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years ."
We can ask a very concrete question .
&quot; Can the brain build such a perception ? &quot;
Is it capable of doing it ?
Does it have the substance to do it ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to describe to you today .
"So , it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain ."
It had to improve it a little bit .
"It had to add to the frontal part , so that you would have instincts , because they had to cope on land ."
But the real big step was the neocortex .
It &apos;s a new brain . You needed it .
"The mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood , social interactions , complex cognitive functions ."
"So , you can think of the neocortex actually as the ultimate solution today , of the universe as we know it ."
"It &apos;s the pinnacle , it &apos;s the final product that the universe has produced ."
"It was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons , to produce this almost frightening organ , structure ."
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path .
"In fact , the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed ."
"If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex , you discover that it &apos;s made up of little modules , G5 processors , like in a computer ."
But there are about a million of them .
They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull .
"And the brain started to fold in on itself , and that &apos;s why the neocortex is so highly convoluted ."
"We &apos;re just packing in columns , so that we &apos;d have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions ."
"So you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano , a million-key grand piano ."
Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note .
You stimulate it ; it produces a symphony .
But it &apos;s not just a symphony of perception .
"It &apos;s a symphony of your universe , your reality ."
"Now , of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys ."
"That &apos;s why you have to send your kids to good schools , hopefully eventually to Oxford ."
But it &apos;s not only education .
It &apos;s also genetics .
"You may be born lucky , where you know how to master your neocortical column , and you can play a fantastic symphony ."
"In fact , there is a new theory of autism called the &quot; &quot; intense world &quot; &quot; theory , which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns ."
"They are highly reactive , and they are super-plastic , and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us ."
"But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns , the note is going to be off ."
"The perception , the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted , and you will have symptoms of disease ."
"So , the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column — and it &apos;s not just for neuroscience ; it &apos;s perhaps to understand perception , to understand reality , and perhaps to even also understand physical reality ."
"So , what we did was , for the past 15 years , was to dissect out the neocortex , systematically ."
It &apos;s a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest .
How many trees does it have ?
What shapes are the trees ?
How many of each type of tree do you have ? Where are they positioned ?
"But it &apos;s a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication , the rules of connectivity , because the neurons don &apos;t just like to connect with any neuron ."
They choose very carefully who they connect with .
It &apos;s also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three-dimensional digital models of them .
"And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons , built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across ."
"And once you have that , you can actually begin to build the neocortical column ."
And here we &apos;re coiling them up .
"But as you do this , what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations , and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse ."
And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other .
And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain .
"Now , the circuit , you could also think of as the fabric of the brain ."
"And when you think of the fabric of the brain , the structure , how is it built ? What is the pattern of the carpet ?"
"You realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain , and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet , out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern ."
The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity .
Every neuron is different .
It &apos;s the same in the forest . Every pine tree is different .
"You may have many different types of trees , but every pine tree is different . And in the brain it &apos;s the same ."
"So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours ."
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way .
And you may have more or less neurons .
"So it &apos;s very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circuitry ."
"So , how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other ?"
"Well , we don &apos;t have to speculate ."
We can look at all 10 million synapses now .
We can look at the fabric . And we can change neurons .
We can use different neurons with different variations .
"We can position them in different places , orient them in different places ."
We can use less or more of them .
And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change .
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not .
"So , the fabric of the brain , even though your brain may be smaller , bigger , it may have different types of neurons , different morphologies of neurons , we actually do share the same fabric ."
"And we think this is species-specific , which means that that could explain why we can &apos;t communicate across species ."
"So , let &apos;s switch it on . But to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come alive ."
"We make it come alive with equations , a lot of mathematics ."
"And , in fact , the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates ."
"So , we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive ."
"We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information , and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other ."
"And when they get to the synapse , what they do is they effectively , literally , shock the synapse ."
It &apos;s like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses .
And we &apos;ve got the mathematics to describe this process .
So we can describe the communication between the neurons .
There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .
But what you do need is a very big computer .
And in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron .
"So you need 10,000 laptops ."
"So where do you go ? You go to IBM , and you get a supercomputer , because they know how to take 10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator ."
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer .
"We can load up all the neurons , each one on to its processor , and fire it up , and see what happens ."
Take the magic carpet for a ride .
Here we activate it . And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation .
It &apos;s the first view .
"Now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; My god . How is reality coming out of that ? &quot;"
"But , in fact , you can start , even though we haven &apos;t trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality ."
"But we can ask , &quot; &quot; Where is the rose ? &quot; &quot; We can ask , &quot; &quot; Where is it inside , if we stimulate it with a picture ? &quot; &quot; Where is it inside the neocortex ?"
Ultimately it &apos;s got to be there if we stimulated it with it .
"So , the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons , ignore the synapses , and look just at the raw electrical activity ."
Because that is what it &apos;s creating .
It &apos;s creating electrical patterns .
"So when we did this , we indeed , for the first time , saw these ghost-like structures : electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column ."
And it &apos;s these electrical objects that are holding all the information about whatever stimulated it .
"And then when we zoomed into this , it &apos;s like a veritable universe ."
So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space .
"And if you do that , you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine , by this piece of the brain ."
"So , in summary , I think that the universe may have — it &apos;s possible — evolved a brain to see itself , which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself ."
"There is a lot more to do to test these theories , and to test any other theories ."
But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain .
"We can do it within 10 years , and if we do succeed , we will send to TED , in 10 years , a hologram to talk to you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
"There &apos;s a man out there , somewhere , who looks a little bit like the actor Idris Elba , or at least he did 20 years ago ."
"And I did exactly what you &apos;re not supposed to do , which is swerve to avoid it ."
( Applause ) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree .
"Where does it come from , and how does it develop , and what are the extreme forms that it can take ?"
So it &apos;s a selfless act intended to benefit only the other .
And the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways .
"Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins , and it results in a personality that &apos;s cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior ."
"First , although they &apos;re not generally insensitive to other people &apos;s emotions , they are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress ."
"And in particular , they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one ."
So these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they &apos;ve never met and may never meet .
They are better at recognizing other people &apos;s fear .
They &apos;re literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress .
This may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions .
Hi .
Thank you .
&#91; Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive .
"The live audience was asked to applaud ASL-style , in silence . &#93; So , five years ago , this was me ."
Then one day I had a fever of 104.7 degrees .
"I probably should have gone to the doctor , but I &apos;d never really been sick in my life , and I knew that usually , if you have a virus , you stay home and you make some chicken soup , and in a few days , everything will be fine ."
But this time it wasn &apos;t fine .
"After the fever broke , for three weeks I was so dizzy , I couldn &apos;t leave my house ."
I would walk straight into door frames .
I had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom .
"That spring I got infection after infection , and every time I went to the doctor , he said there was absolutely nothing wrong ."
Maybe this is what it &apos;s like to be on the other side of 25 .
( Laughter ) Then the neurological symptoms started .
Sometimes I would find that I couldn &apos;t draw the right side of a circle .
Other times I wouldn &apos;t be able to speak or move at all .
"I saw every kind of specialist : infectious disease doctors , dermatologists , endocrinologists , cardiologists ."
I even saw a psychiatrist .
"My psychiatrist said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s clear you &apos;re really sick , but not with anything psychiatric ."
"I hope they can find out what &apos;s wrong with you . &quot; &quot; The next day , my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder ."
"He told me that everything — the fevers , the sore throats , the sinus infection , all of the gastrointestinal , neurological and cardiac symptoms — were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that I could not remember ."
"The symptoms were real , he said , but they had no biological cause ."
I was training to be a social scientist .
"I had studied statistics , probability theory , mathematical modeling , experimental design ."
I felt like I couldn &apos;t just reject my neurologist &apos;s diagnosis .
"It didn &apos;t feel true , but I knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive , so easily obscured by what we want to believe ."
So I had to consider the possibility that he was right .
"That day , I ran a small experiment ."
"I walked back the two miles from my neurologist &apos;s office to my house , my legs wrapped in this strange , almost electric kind of pain ."
"I meditated on that pain , contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this ."
My brain and my spinal cord were burning .
"My neck was so stiff I couldn &apos;t touch my chin to my chest , and the slightest sound — the rustling of the sheets , my husband walking barefoot in the next room — could cause excruciating pain ."
I would spend most of the next two years in bed .
How could my doctor have gotten it so wrong ?
"I thought I had a rare disease , something doctors had never seen ."
I was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis .
"If my husband goes for a run , he might be sore for a couple of days ."
It is a perfect custom prison .
"It &apos;s been four years , and I &apos;ve still never been as well as I was the minute before I walked home from my neurologist &apos;s office ."
"In the US , where I &apos;m from , it &apos;s about one million people ."
How could a disease this common and this devastating have been forgotten by medicine ?
The Roman physician Galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly passionate women .
"The Greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture , pressing on internal organs — yes — causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis ."
The cure was marriage and motherhood .
"All of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women , and in time , when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease , they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria ."
Why has this idea had such staying power ?
"They want to know the answer , and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable , to explain illnesses that have no explanation ."
The problem is that this can cause real harm .
"In the 1950s , a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater studied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria ."
"Nine years later , 12 of them were dead and 30 had become disabled ."
"All around the world , ME is one of the least funded diseases ."
"In the US , we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient , 250 dollars per MS patient and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient ."
This was not just lightning .
I was not just unlucky .
"The ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice , a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us ."
"Another woman with ovarian cancer , who for years was told that it was just early menopause ."
"Like the hysteria of old , this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe ."
"Seventy-five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women , and in some diseases , it &apos;s as high as 90 percent ."
And men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed .
My brain is not what it used to be .
"Here &apos;s the good part : despite everything , I still have hope ."
So many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we assume ?
"Or better , how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?"
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
"Year after year , after year , they &apos;re more innovative than all their competition ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great orator of the day ."
"And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern ."
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
"All I did was codify it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simplest idea ."
I call it the golden circle .
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
Let me define the terms really quickly .
"Every single person , every single organization on the planet knows what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do ."
"By &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your purpose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
I use Apple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly ."
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
"&quot; &quot; Everything we do , we believe in challenging the status quo ."
We believe in thinking differently .
We just happen to make great computers .
"But we &apos;re also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple , or a phone from Apple , or a DVR from Apple ."
Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products .
"A few years ago , Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs ."
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs .
Nobody bought one .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
"Not psychology , biology ."
"Our newest brain , our Homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language .
"The middle two sections make up our limbic brains , and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings , like trust and loyalty ."
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
This is where gut decisions come from .
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to hire people who believe what you believe .
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
"And Samuel Pierpont Langley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success ."
Money was no problem .
He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic .
"The New York Times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for Langley ."
Then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
"The difference was , Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief ."
"They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
"And lo and behold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the paycheck .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get famous , so he quit ."
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe ?
The next 13.5 % of our population are our early adopters .
"And these guys , the innovators and the early adopters , they &apos;re comfortable making those gut decisions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe ."
"So let me give you a famous example , a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation ."
It &apos;s a commercial example .
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went IPO , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted , and it &apos;s never traded above 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the summer of 1963 , 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gift .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for themselves .
"We followed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
"Leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us ."
So I &apos;m going to speak about a problem that I have and that &apos;s that I &apos;m a philosopher .
"( Laughter ) When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a professor , &quot; &quot; their eyes glaze over ."
"When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around , they ask me what field I &apos;m in and I say , &quot; &quot; philosophy &quot; &quot; — their eyes glaze over ."
"( Laughter ) When I go to a philosopher &apos;s party ( Laughter ) and they ask me what I work on and I say , &quot; &quot; consciousness , &quot; &quot; their eyes don &apos;t glaze over — their lips curl into a snarl . ( Laughter )"
"And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s impossible ! You can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot; &quot; The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question ."
"My late , lamented friend Bob Nozick , a fine philosopher , in one of his books , &quot; &quot; Philosophical Explanations , &quot; &quot; is commenting on the ethos of philosophy — the way philosophers go about their business ."
"And he says , you know , &quot; &quot; Philosophers love rational argument . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion , and if they don &apos;t accept the conclusion , they die ."
Their heads explode . &quot; &quot; The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents .
But in fact that doesn &apos;t change people &apos;s minds at all .
"It &apos;s very hard to change people &apos;s minds about something like consciousness , and I finally figured out the reason for that ."
The reason for that is that everybody &apos;s an expert on consciousness .
We heard the other day that everybody &apos;s got a strong opinion about video games .
"They all have an idea for a video game , even if they &apos;re not experts ."
But they don &apos;t consider themselves experts on video games ; they &apos;ve just got strong opinions .
"I &apos;m sure that people here who work on , say , climate change and global warming , or on the future of the Internet , encounter people who have very strong opinions about what &apos;s going to happen next ."
But they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
They &apos;re just strongly held opinions .
"But with regard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; &quot; I am an expert ."
"Simply by being conscious , I know all about this . &quot; &quot; And so , you tell them your theory and they say , &quot; &quot; No , no , that &apos;s not the way consciousness is !"
"No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot; &quot; And they say this with an amazing confidence ."
And so what I &apos;m going to try to do today is to shake your confidence . Because I know the feeling — I can feel it myself .
"I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds — that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness ."
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
"Now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble ."
I think everybody understands what that means .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that &apos;s ever been done .
It &apos;s a Saul Steinberg of course — it was a New Yorker cover .
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque .
"That reminds him of the word baroque , barrack , bark , poodle , Suzanne R. — he &apos;s off to the races ."
"There &apos;s a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along , you learn a lot about this man ."
"What I particularly like about this picture , too , is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style ."
"Which reminds us , as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday : what we are , what each of us is — what you are , what I am — is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
"No other ingredients at all . We &apos;re just made of cells , about 100 trillion of them ."
"Not a single one of those cells is conscious ; not a single one of those cells knows who you are , or cares ."
"Somehow , we have to explain how when you put together teams , armies , battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells — not so different really from a bacterium , each one of them — the result is this . I mean , just look at it ."
"The content — there &apos;s color , there &apos;s ideas , there &apos;s memories , there &apos;s history . And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons ."
How is that possible ? Many people just think it isn &apos;t possible at all .
"They think , &quot; &quot; No , there can &apos;t be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness . &quot; &quot; This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel , who &apos;s a professor of religion , actually , at the University of Hawaii , and he &apos;s an expert magician , and an expert on the street magic of India , which is what this book is about , &quot; Net of Magic . &quot;"
And there &apos;s a passage in it which I would love to share with you .
It speaks so eloquently to the problem .
"&quot; &quot; &apos; I &apos;m writing a book on magic , &apos; I explain , and I &apos;m asked , &apos; Real magic ? &apos; By &apos; real magic , &apos; people mean miracles , thaumaturgical acts , and supernatural powers ."
"&apos;No , &apos; I answer . &apos; Conjuring tricks , not real magic . &apos; &apos; Real magic , &apos; in other words , refers to the magic that is not real ; while the magic that is real , that can actually be done , is not real magic . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s the way a lot of people feel about consciousness . ( Laughter )"
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks .
"If you &apos;re going to explain this as a bag of tricks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , whatever it is ."
"And , as Marvin said , and as other people have said , &quot; Consciousness is a bag of tricks . &quot;"
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness .
"So this is the problem . So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a magic trick explained to you ."
"How many of you here , if somebody — some smart aleck — starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done , you sort of want to block your ears and say , &quot; &quot; No , no , I don &apos;t want to know !"
Don &apos;t take the thrill of it away . I &apos;d rather be mystified .
"Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot; &quot; A lot of people feel that way about consciousness , I &apos;ve discovered ."
"And I &apos;m sorry if I impose some clarity , some understanding on you ."
You &apos;d better leave now if you don &apos;t want to know some of these tricks .
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick ?
"The philosopher says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to explain to you how that &apos;s done ."
"You see , the magician doesn &apos;t really saw the lady in half . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; He merely makes you think that he does . &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; Yes , and how does he do that ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s not my department , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness ."
But I &apos;m going to try to also show you that consciousness isn &apos;t quite as marvelous — your own consciousness isn &apos;t quite as wonderful — as you may have thought it is .
"This is something , by the way , that Lee Siegel talks about in his book ."
"He marvels at how he &apos;ll do a magic show , and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X , Y , and Z. He never did those things ."
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
People &apos;s memories inflate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
"Now , let &apos;s see if this will work . All right . Let &apos;s just watch this ."
Watch it carefully .
"I &apos;m working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer , and this is a little demo that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in ."
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
It &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
"OK , now , you all saw what changed , right ?"
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color ?
Every one . I &apos;ll just show you by running it again .
"Even when you know that they &apos;re all going to change color , it &apos;s very hard to notice . You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all ."
"Now , this is an example — one of many — of a phenomenon that &apos;s now being studied quite a bit ."
"It &apos;s one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book , &quot; &quot; Consciousness Explained , &quot; &quot; where I said if you did experiments of this sort , you &apos;d find that people were unable to pick up really large changes ."
"If there &apos;s time at the end , I &apos;ll show you the much more dramatic case ."
"Now , how can it be that there are all those changes going on , and that we &apos;re not aware of them ?"
"Well , earlier today , Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades , the way your eye moves around three or four times a second ."
"He didn &apos;t mention the speed . Your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world ."
"And where your eye isn &apos;t looking , you &apos;re remarkably impoverished in your vision ."
"That &apos;s because the foveal part of your eye , which is the high-resolution part , is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length ."
That &apos;s the detail part .
"It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?"
"It doesn &apos;t seem that way , but that &apos;s the way it is ."
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
Here &apos;s a completely different effect . This is a painting by Bellotto .
It &apos;s in the museum in North Carolina .
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto &apos;s .
And I love paintings like that — the painting is actually about as big as it is right here .
"And I love Canalettos , because Canaletto has this fantastic detail , and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting ."
"And I started across the hall in North Carolina , because I thought it was probably a Canaletto , and would have all that in detail ."
"And I noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people — you can just barely see them walking across the bridge ."
"And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth ."
"And as I got closer and closer , I actually screamed ."
"I yelled out because when I got closer , I found the detail wasn &apos;t there at all ."
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .
"And as I walked towards the picture , I was expecting detail that wasn &apos;t there ."
"The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things , and my brain had taken the suggestion ."
"You &apos;re familiar with a more recent technology , which is — There , you can get a better view of the blobs ."
"See , when you get close they &apos;re really just blobs of paint ."
You will have seen something like this — this is the reverse effect .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
"Now , what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?"
"When an artful blob of paint or two , by an artist , suggests a person — say , one of Marvin Minsky &apos;s little society of mind — do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere ?"
"I don &apos;t think so . Not a chance . But then , how on Earth is it done ?"
"Well , remember the philosopher &apos;s explanation of the lady ?"
It &apos;s the same thing .
The brain just makes you think that it &apos;s got the detail there .
"You think the detail &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there ."
The brain isn &apos;t actually putting the detail in your head at all .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
"Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right , rotated ?"
Yes .
"How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?"
How many of you rotated the one on the right ? OK .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science — various experiments started by Roger Shepherd , who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images ."
"Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that ."
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
"And if you read that literature , one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you &apos;re the subject in the experiment , you don &apos;t know ."
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain beliefs .
"And they come in a certain order , at a certain time ."
And what explains the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
"Well , that &apos;s where you have to go backstage and ask the magician ."
"This is a figure that I love : Bradley , Petrie , and Dumais ."
"You may think that I &apos;ve cheated , that I &apos;ve put a little whiter-than-white boundary there ."
"How many of you see that sort of boundary , with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles ?"
Can you see it ?
"Well , you know , in effect , the boundary &apos;s really there , in a certain sense ."
"Your brain is actually computing that boundary , the boundary that goes right there ."
"But now , notice there are two ways of seeing the cube , right ?"
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? OK .
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
"If you &apos;re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it ."
"As a cube , on a black background , as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese ."
( Laughter ) Can you get it ? How many of you can &apos;t get it ? That &apos;ll help . ( Laughter )
Now you can get it . These are two very different phenomena .
"When you see the cube one way , behind the screen , those boundaries go away ."
"But there &apos;s still a sort of filling in , as we can tell if we look at this ."
"We don &apos;t have any trouble seeing the cube , but where does the color change ?"
Does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who &apos;s going to paint that bit behind the curtain ? No .
Your brain just lets it go . The brain doesn &apos;t need to fill that in .
"When I first started talking about the Bradley , Petrie , Dumais example that you just saw — I &apos;ll go back to it , this one — I said that there was no filling-in behind there ."
"And I supposed that that was just a flat truth , always true ."
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
"Now , if you think you see some pale yellow — I &apos;ll run this a few more times ."
"Look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there — yeah , it &apos;s amazing . There &apos;s nothing there . It &apos;s no trick ."
"&#91; &quot; &quot; Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes &quot; &quot; slide &#93; This is Ron Rensink &apos;s work , which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book ."
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
"What you &apos;re going to see is two pictures , one of which is slightly different from the other ."
"You see here the red roof and the gray roof , and in between them there will be a mask , which is just a blank screen , for about a quarter of a second ."
"So you &apos;ll see the first picture , then a mask , then the second picture , then a mask ."
"And this will just continue , and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change ."
"So , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank ."
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
"And keep going , until the subject presses the button , saying , &quot; I see the change . &quot;"
So now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . Some examples .
No trouble there .
Can everybody see ? All right .
"Indeed , Rensink &apos;s subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button ."
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the roof of that barn ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s easy .
Is it a bridge or a dock ?
"There are a few more really dramatic ones , and then I &apos;ll close ."
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
This one because it &apos;s so large and yet it &apos;s pretty hard to see .
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
Dan Dennett : See the shadows going back and forth ? Pretty big .
So 15.5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there .
"I love this one . I &apos;ll end with this one , just because it &apos;s such an obvious and important thing ."
How many still don &apos;t see it ? How many still don &apos;t see it ?
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing ?
( Laughter ) Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
"What I wanted to show you is that scientists , using their from-the-outside , third-person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are ."
And we &apos;re really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
"Jeff Hawkins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience ."
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
"Harvard Medical School once — I was at a talk — director of the lab said , &quot; &quot; In our lab , we have a saying ."
"If you work on one neuron , that &apos;s neuroscience ."
"If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"I ’ m going around the world giving talks about Darwin , and usually what I ’ m talking about is Darwin ’ s strange inversion of reasoning ."
"Now that title , that phrase , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to deal , Absolute Ignorance is the artificer ; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system , that , in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine , it is not requisite to know how to make it ."
"This proposition will be found on careful examination to express , in condensed form , the essential purport of the Theory , and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin ’ s meaning ; who , by a strange inversion of reasoning , seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill . &quot; &quot; Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion ."
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it : &quot; &quot; Test Two : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a builder ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any painting that didn ’ t have a painter ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any car that didn ’ t have a maker ? Yes / No .
"If you answered &apos; Yes &apos; for any of the above , give details . &quot; &quot; A-ha ! I mean , it really is a strange inversion of reasoning ."
You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer .
But Darwin shows that it ’ s just false .
"Today , though , I ’ m going to talk about Darwin ’ s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet .
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
We adore babies because they ’ re so cute .
"And , of course , we are amused by jokes because they are funny ."
This is all backwards . It is . And Darwin shows us why .
"Let ’ s start with sweet . Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector , because sugar is high energy , and it ’ s just been wired up to the preferer , to put it very crudely , and that ’ s why we like sugar ."
"Honey is sweet because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because honey is sweet . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey ."
"If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind , you wouldn ’ t see why they tasted sweet ."
You have to look in our brains to understand why they ’ re sweet .
"So if you think first there was sweetness , and then we evolved to like sweetness , you ’ ve got it backwards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way round ."
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved .
And there ’ s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then Mother Nature would have a problem : How on earth do you get chimps to mate ?"
"Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a solution : hallucinations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quicker way ."
"Just wire the chimps up to love that look , and apparently they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"Over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways ."
"We became bald-bodied , oddly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we hadn ’ t , then probably this would be the height of sexiness ."
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food .
It wasn ’ t designed for chocolate cake .
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus .
"The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen , who did his famous experiments with gulls , where he found that that orange spot on the gull ’ s beak — if he made a bigger , oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder ."
"It was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it ."
"What we see with , say , chocolate cake is it ’ s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring ."
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli ; chocolate cake is one .
There &apos;s lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness .
And there &apos;s even supernormal stimuli for cuteness . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy diapers ."
"So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby ."
So nature works on many levels here .
"But now , if babies didn ’ t look the way they do — if babies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find adorable , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , oh my goodness , do I ever want to hug that ."
This is the strange inversion .
"Well now , finally what about funny . My answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t obvious . That ’ s why I leave it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think evolutionarily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s dirty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a powerful , inbuilt reward for it when we succeed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colleagues ."
It ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to spell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off , by turning the knob on a joke — now it ’ s not funny ... oh , now it ’ s funnier ..."
"now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not funny — in this way , we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain , the functional architecture of the brain ."
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this . We call it the Hurley Model .
"He ’ s a computer scientist , Reginald Adams a psychologist , and there I am , and we ’ re putting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .

Let me explain what that is .

"77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 ."
"That seems right , I &apos;ll go on . Cookie fission , OK ."
Audience : Yeah ! AB : Good .
Thank you very much .
"Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal ."
It takes guts to stand out like that .
So a movement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
"And what a perfect place to do that , at TED ."
( Applause )
"But there is a new , technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value , and it &apos;s called the blockchain ."
"Now , that &apos;s a pretty bold statement , but if you take nothing else away from this talk , I actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new , it &apos;s also a continuation of a very human story , and the story is this ."
"As humans , we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value ."
"He passed away at the end of 2015 , but North pioneered what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; new institutional economics . &quot; &quot; And what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution , and informal constraints , like bribery ."
"As our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant , we built up more formal institutions , institutions like banks for currency , governments , corporations ."
"As Douglass North saw it , institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society ."
So what is the blockchain ?
"The transactions are secured through cryptography , and over time , that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured ."
"This creates an immutable , unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network ."
This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network .
It &apos;s not an app .
It &apos;s not a company .
I think it &apos;s closest in description to something like Wikipedia .
We can see everything on Wikipedia .
It &apos;s a composite view that &apos;s constantly changing and being updated .
"On Wikipedia , it &apos;s an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time ."
"On the blockchain , you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets ."
"It stores the history of custodianship , ownership and location for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin , other digital assets like a title of ownership of IP ."
"It could be a certificate , a contract , real world objects , even personal identifiable information ."
"So let &apos;s take the first example , not knowing who we &apos;re dealing with ."
Say I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay .
The first thing I &apos;m going to do is look up who I &apos;m buying from .
Are they a power user ?
"Do they have great reviews and ratings , or do they have no profile at all ?"
"Reviews , ratings , checkmarks : these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we &apos;re dealing with ."
But the problem is they &apos;re very fragmented .
Think about how many profiles you have .
"Blockchains allow for us to create an open , global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source ."
This allows us to create a user-controlled portable identity .
"Using the blockchain , we can create a shared reality across nontrusting entities ."
Think back to Wikipedia .
"It &apos;s a shared database , and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time , it has one single truth ."
We can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority .
"It means for consumers , we can have a lot more transparency ."
This is a whole new world in terms of our visibility .
"So I &apos;ve talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades , like in a supply chain ."
"The last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open-ended , and it &apos;s reneging ."
What if you don &apos;t send me the smartphone ?
Can I get my money back ?
"Blockchains allow us to write code , binding contracts , between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer ."
"So if we look at the smartphone example , you could think about escrow ."
"You are financing that phone , but you don &apos;t need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met ."
You got the phone .
"It means a lot of human economic activity can get collateralized and automated , and push a lot of human intervention to the edges , the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain ."
"So rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks , our governments , our corporations , we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open ."
It &apos;s also an innovation in computer science .
"Blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange , of exchange of currency , of all kinds of digital and physical assets , even of our own personal attributes , in a totally new way ."
Thank you .
"( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Thank you , Bettina ."
"I think I understood that it &apos;s coming , it offers a lot of potential , and it &apos;s complex ."
What is your estimate for the rate of adoption ?
What is a parent ? What is a parent ?
"It &apos;s not an easy question . Today we have adoption ,"
Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation ?
"If so , when ?"
What words to use ?
"Sperm donors are often referred to as &quot; &quot; biological fathers , &quot; &quot; but should we really be using the word &quot; &quot; father ? &quot; &quot; As a philosopher and social scientist , I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood ."
"But today , I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children ."
"I will show you that they know what matters most in a family , even though their family looks a little different ."
I will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions .
But I will also show you the parents &apos; uncertainties .
"In this treatment timeline , you can see two points at which we conducted interviews ."
"We included heterosexual couples , where the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm , and lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere ."
We also included children .
I wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family .
"In fact , that is what I asked them , only not in that way ."
I drew an apple tree instead .
"This way , I could ask abstract , philosophical questions in a way that did not make them run off ."
And that illustrates my research approach .
"By designing techniques like this , I can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview , because I want to hear that from them ."
I asked them : What would your family look like if it were an apple tree ?
"And they could take a paper apple for everyone who , in their view , was a member of the family , write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted ."
And I would ask questions .
Most children started with a parent or a sibling .
"One started with &quot; &quot; Boxer , &quot; &quot; the dead dog of his grandparents ."
"At this point , none of the children started mentioning the donor ."
"So , I asked them about their birth story ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Before you were born , it was just your mom and dad , or mom and mommy ."
Can you tell me how you came into the family ? &quot; &quot; And they explained .
"One said , &quot; &quot; My parents did not have good seeds , but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds ."
"She put the seeds in her belly — somehow — and her belly grew really big , and there I was . &quot; &quot; Hmm ."
"So only when they started mentioning the donor , I asked questions about him , using their own words ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t put this one up there with the others ."
He &apos;s not part of my family .
But I will not put him on the ground .
That &apos;s too cold and too hard .
"I think he should be in the trunk , because he made my family possible ."
"If he would not have done this , that would really be sad because my family would not be here , and I would not be here . &quot; &quot; So also , parents constructed family tales — tales to tell their children ."
And why not ?
It &apos;s their way of explaining ; their do-it-yourself with family narratives .
DIY .
"And these stories were highly diverse , but they all had one thing in common : it was a tale of longing for a child and a quest for that child ."
It was about how special and how deeply loved their child was .
And research so far shows that these children are doing fine .
They do not have more problems than other kids .
Underlying was a fear that their children might disapprove and would reject the non-genetic parent .
Well .
I want to tell you about a teenage boy .
He was donor-conceived but not part of our study .
You &apos;re not even my father ! &quot; &quot; That was exactly what the parents in our study feared .
"Now , the boy soon felt sorry , and they made up ."
But it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting .
"He said , &quot; &quot; This outburst had nothing to do with the lack of a genetic link ."
It &apos;s what they do at that age .
These things happen in all families .
"And every now and then , all parents may wonder : Am I a good enough parent ?"
"These parents , too ."
"They , above all , wanted to do what &apos;s best for their child ."
But they also sometimes wondered : Am I a real parent ?
"Even 10 years later , they still remember the advice they were given ."
The counselor said so . &quot; &quot; Well .
I don &apos;t know ; that &apos;s quite different from how we respond to children &apos;s questions .
"We will not say , &quot; No , milk is not made in a factory . &quot;"
"So something strange happened here , and of course these children noticed that ."
"One boy said , &quot; &quot; I asked my parents loads of questions , but they acted really weird ."
"So , you know , I have a friend at school , and she &apos;s made in the same way ."
"When I have a question , I just go and ask her . &quot; &quot; Clever guy ."
Problem solved .
And that &apos;s the strange thing about advice .
"When we offer people pills , we gather evidence first ."
And advice ?
It should be advice that there is evidence for — evidence that it actually improves patients &apos; lives .
So the philosopher in me would now like to offer you a paradox : I advise you to stop following advice .
"But , yes ."
( Applause ) I will not end here with what went wrong ; I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families .
Remember the books and the trip to the farmer ?
"When parents do things that work for them , they do brilliant things ."
And we do not need to be professionals to create those .
"In that case , bear in mind three things ."
Work with advice that works for your family .
"Remember — you &apos;re the expert , because you live your family life ."
"And finally , believe in your abilities and your creativity , because you can do it yourself ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"I was depressed ; I said , but I can make a difference in this field ."
So why don &apos;t we have a good theory of brains ?
"Reality , though — I call it real intelligence ."
It can attack . It can do all kinds of stuff .
But the robotics part is the hardest part . That &apos;s old brain . That &apos;s really hard .
I have a confession to make .
"But first , I want you to make a little confession to me ."
"In the past year , I want you to just raise your hand if you &apos;ve experienced relatively little stress ."
Anyone ?
How about a moderate amount of stress ?
Who has experienced a lot of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
But that is not my confession .
"My confession is this : I am a health psychologist , and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier ."
"But I fear that something I &apos;ve been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good , and it has to do with stress ."
"For years I &apos;ve been telling people , stress makes you sick ."
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
"Basically , I &apos;ve turned stress into the enemy ."
"But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change yours ."
Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress .
"This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years , and they started by asking people , &quot; How much stress have you experienced in the last year ? &quot;"
"They also asked , &quot; Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health ? &quot;"
And then they used public death records to find out who died .
( Laughter ) Okay .
Some bad news first .
People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying .
But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health .
( Laughter ) People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die .
"Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths , 182,000 Americans died prematurely , not from stress , but from the belief that stress is bad for you ."
"( Laughter ) That is over 20,000 deaths a year ."
( Laughter ) You can see why this study freaked me out .
Here I &apos;ve been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health .
So this study got me wondering : Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier ?
And here the science says yes .
"When you change your mind about stress , you can change your body &apos;s response to stress ."
"Now to explain how this works , I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out ."
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
"You come into the laboratory , and you &apos;re told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you , and to make sure you feel the pressure , there are bright lights and a camera in your face , kind of like this ."
"( Laughter ) And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging , non-verbal feedback , like this ."
"( Exhales ) ( Laughter ) Now that you &apos;re sufficiently demoralized , time for part two : a math test ."
"And unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it ."
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fun .
For me .
Okay .
( Laughter ) I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven .
"You &apos;re going to do this out loud , as fast as you can , starting with 996 ."
Go !
( Audience counting ) Go faster . Faster please .
You &apos;re going too slow .
"( Audience counting ) Stop . Stop , stop , stop ."
That guy made a mistake .
We are going to have to start all over again .
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re not very good at this , are you ?"
"Okay , so you get the idea ."
"Your heart might be pounding , you might be breathing faster , maybe breaking out into a sweat ."
"And normally , we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren &apos;t coping very well with the pressure ."
Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University .
"Before they went through the social stress test , they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful ."
That pounding heart is preparing you for action .
"If you &apos;re breathing faster , it &apos;s no problem ."
It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
"And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance , well , they were less stressed out , less anxious , more confident , but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed ."
And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease .
It &apos;s not really healthy to be in this state all the time .
"But in the study , when participants viewed their stress response as helpful , their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this ."
"Their heart was still pounding , but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile ."
It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage .
"Over a lifetime of stressful experiences , this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s ."
"And this is really what the new science of stress reveals , that how you think about stress matters ."
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed .
I no longer want to get rid of your stress .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little intervention .
"And when you view stress in that way , your body believes you , and your stress response becomes healthier ."
"Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from , so we are going to do one more intervention ."
"I want to tell you about one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response , and the idea is this : Stress makes you social ."
"To understand this side of stress , we need to talk about a hormone , oxytocin , and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get ."
"It even has its own cute nickname , the cuddle hormone , because it &apos;s released when you hug someone ."
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in .
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone .
It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships .
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family .
It enhances your empathy .
It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin ...
to become more compassionate and caring .
But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
It &apos;s a stress hormone .
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response .
It &apos;s as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound .
"And when oxytocin is released in the stress response , it is motivating you to seek support ."
"Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel , instead of bottling it up ."
Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other .
"Okay , so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier ?"
"Well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain ."
It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress .
But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart .
"Your heart has receptors for this hormone , and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage ."
This stress hormone strengthens your heart .
And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support .
"So when you reach out to others under stress , either to seek support or to help someone else , you release more of this hormone , your stress response becomes healthier , and you actually recover faster from stress ."
"I find this amazing , that your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience , and that mechanism is human connection ."
I want to finish by telling you about one more study .
"This study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States , and they ranged in age from 34 to 93 , and they started the study by asking , &quot; How much stress have you experienced in the last year ? &quot;"
"Okay , so the bad news first : For every major stressful life experience , like financial difficulties or family crisis , that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent ."
But — and I hope you are expecting a &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; by now — but that wasn &apos;t true for everyone .
People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying .
Zero .
Caring created resilience .
And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable .
How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress .
"When you choose to view your stress response as helpful , you create the biology of courage ."
"And when you choose to connect with others under stress , you can create resilience ."
"Now I wouldn &apos;t necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life , but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress ."
Stress gives us access to our hearts .
"The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others , and yes , your pounding physical heart , working so hard to give you strength and energy ."
"And when you choose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty profound statement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to handle life &apos;s challenges .
And you &apos;re remembering that you don &apos;t have to face them alone .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) Chris Anderson : This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us ."
It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone &apos;s life expectancy .
"It &apos;s equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it , in some sense ?"
"In 1987 , Tina Lord found herself in quite the pickle ."
Cord &apos;s mother Maria was thrilled until they hooked up again .
"Tina had already been kidnapped , strapped to a raft and sent over a waterfall ."
She and her baby were presumed dead .
&quot; &quot; Stop ! &quot; &quot; she screamed .
&quot; &quot; Am I too late ?
"Cord , I &apos;ve come so far ."
"( Laughter ) Now , if you &apos;ve ever seen a soap opera , you know the stories and the characters can be exaggerated , larger than life , and if you &apos;re a fan , you find that exaggeration fun , and if you &apos;re not , maybe you find them melodramatic or unsophisticated ."
"Maybe you think watching soap operas is a waste of time , that their bigness means their lessons are small or nonexistent ."
But I believe the opposite to be true .
"Soap operas reflect life , just bigger ."
So I know my stuff .
"( Laughter ) And yes , soap operas are larger than life , drama on a grand scale , but our lives can be filled with as much intensity , and the stakes can feel just as dramatic ."
We cycle through tragedy and joy just like these characters .
"And most importantly , they show us it &apos;s never too late to change your story ."
"So with that , let &apos;s start with soap opera lesson one : surrender is not an option ."
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All My Children &quot; &quot; &apos; s Erica Kane was daytime &apos;s version of Scarlett O &apos;Hara , a hyperbolically self-important princess who deep down was scrappy and daring ."
"Now , in her 41 years on TV , perhaps Erica &apos;s most famous scene is her alone in the woods suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear ."
"She screamed at the bear , &quot; &quot; You may not do this !"
Do you understand me ?
You may not come near me !
"I am Erica Kane and you are a filthy beast ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And of course the bear left , so what that teaches us is obstacles are to be expected and we can choose to surrender or we can stand and fight ."
Pandora &apos;s Tim Westergren knows this better than most .
You might even call him the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley .
They were out of cash the next year .
"Now , lots of companies fold at that point , but Tim chose to fight ."
He maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt and it still wasn &apos;t enough .
"More than 50 people deferred two million dollars , and now , more than a decade later , Pandora is worth billions ."
"Now , this is scary ."
It &apos;s an acknowledgment of need or fallibility .
Stephanie Forrester of &quot; &quot; The Bold and the Beautiful &quot; &quot; thought she was pretty darn special .
"But after nearly 25 years of epic fighting , Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in ."
Drop your ego .
Life is not about you .
"Howard rejoined the team in 2008 , and one of the first things he did was apologize to all 180,000 employees ."
He apologized .
"And then he asked for help , honesty , and ideas in return ."
"And now , Starbucks has more than doubled its net revenue since Howard came back ."
"It &apos;s not helping anyone , least of all you ."
Sacrifice your ego .
You &apos;re not meant to be static characters .
"On television , static equals boring and boring equals fired ."
Characters are supposed to grow and change .
"Now , on TV , those dynamic changes can make for some rough transitions , particularly when a character is played by one person yesterday and played by someone new today ."
Recasting happens all the time on soaps .
"Now , there was always an essential nugget of Carly in there , but the character and the story adapted to whomever was playing her ."
And here &apos;s what that means for us .
"We can choose to draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot , or we can open ourselves to opportunities like Carly , who went from nursing student to hotel owner , or like Julia Child ."
"We all have the power to initiate change in our lives , to evolve and adapt ."
"We make the choice , but sometimes life chooses for us , and we don &apos;t get a heads up ."
Surprise slams us in the face .
"You &apos;re flat on the ground , the air is gone , and you need resuscitation ."
So thank goodness for soap opera lesson four : resurrection is possible .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) In 1983 , &quot; &quot; Days of Our Lives &quot; &quot; &apos; Stefano DiMera died of a stroke , but not really , because in 1984 he died when his car plunged into the harbor , and yet he was back in 1985 with a brain tumor . ( Laughter )"
"But before the tumor could kill him , Marlena shot him , and he tumbled off a catwalk to his death ."
And so it went for 30 years .
"( Laughter ) Even when we saw the body , we knew better ."
He &apos;s called the Phoenix for a reason .
And here &apos;s what that means for us .
"As long as the show is still on the air , or you &apos;re still breathing , nothing is permanent ."
Resurrection is possible .
"Now , of course , just like life , soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale ."
It was six months of dying and I rode that train right into the mountain .
"( Laughter ) Three months later , nothing was OK ."
"That was when I watched the final episode air , and I realized the show was not the only fatality ."
I was one too .
I just had to tap into everything I had ever learned about soap operas .
"I had to be brave like Erica and refuse to surrender , so every day , I made a decision to fight ."
I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie and sacrifice my ego .
I had to ask for help a lot of times across many states .
"I had to be adaptable like Carly and evolve my skills , my mindset , and my circumstances , and then I had to be resilient , like Stefano , and resurrect myself and my career like a phoenix from the ashes ."
Eventually I got an interview .
"After 15 years in news and entertainment , nine months of unemployment and this one interview , I had an offer for an entry level job ."
I was 37 years old and I was back from the dead .
"We will all experience what looks like an ending , and we can choose to make it a beginning ."
"Kind of like Tina , who miraculously survived that waterfall , and because I hate to leave a cliffhanger hanging , Tina and Cord did get divorced , but they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in 2012 ."
"So remember , as long as there is breath in your body , it &apos;s never too late to change your story ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I am British .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Never before has the phrase &quot; &quot; I am British &quot; &quot; elicited so much pity . ( Laughter )
I come from an island where many of us like to believe there &apos;s been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years .
We tend to have historically imposed change on others but done much less of it ourselves .
"So it came as an immense shock to me when I woke up on the morning of June 24 to discover that my country had voted to leave the European Union , my Prime Minister had resigned , and Scotland was considering a referendum that could bring to an end the very existence of the United Kingdom ."
"So that was an immense shock for me , and it was an immense shock for many people , but it was also something that , over the following several days , created a complete political meltdown in my country ."
"There were calls for a second referendum , almost as if , following a sports match , we could ask the opposition for a replay ."
Everybody was blaming everybody else .
They blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough .
The educated blamed the less well-educated .
That complete meltdown was made even worse by the most tragic element of it : levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain at a level that I have never seen before in my lifetime .
"People are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England , or , as one of my colleagues put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the Atlantic Ocean ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the degree of shock that we &apos;ve experienced since ?"
Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions .
"First , what does Brexit represent , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respond ?
"So first , what does Brexit represent ?"
Hindsight is a wonderful thing .
Brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The vote split along lines of age , education , class and geography ."
"Geographically , it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed to being part of the European Union , while in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence ."
Those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously .
"But more profoundly , the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today ."
Contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about tax and spend .
It &apos;s about globalization .
The fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization and those that fear globalization .
But those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation .
They represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject .
The blue areas show Remain and the red areas Leave .
"When I looked at this , what personally struck me was the very little time in my life I &apos;ve actually spent in many of the red areas ."
"In some of those places , I didn &apos;t even know the names of the voting districts ."
"( Applause ) And the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to narrate globalization to those people , to recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university , who haven &apos;t necessarily grown up with the Internet , that don &apos;t get opportunities to travel , they may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive in our often liberal bubbles . ( Applause )"
It means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand .
"In the Leave vote , a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred , creating lies and mistrust around , for instance , the idea that the vote on Europe could reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe , when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration from outside the European Union ."
But for a significant majority of the Leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment .
This replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world .
"We see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States , with the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary , with the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France ."
The specter of Brexit is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about creating liberal , open , tolerant societies , we urgently need a new vision , a vision of a more tolerant , inclusive globalization , one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind ."
That vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization .
"The consensus amongst economists is that free trade , the movement of capital , the movement of people across borders benefit everyone on aggregate ."
"The consensus amongst international relations scholars is that globalization brings interdependence , which brings cooperation and peace ."
But globalization also has redistributive effects .
It creates winners and losers .
"To take the example of migration , we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances ."
"But we also have to be very aware that there are redistributive consequences , that importantly , low-skilled immigration can lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies and also put pressure on house prices ."
"In 2002 , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Kofi Annan , gave a speech at Yale University , and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization ."
That was the speech in which he coined that term .
Bigotry and ignorance are the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization . &quot; &quot; That idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008 in a conference on progressive governance involving many of the leaders of European countries .
"But amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008 , the concept disappeared almost without a trace ."
Globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda .
It &apos;s perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all .
"So the question is , how can we achieve that goal ?"
How can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scientist , that social science offers some places to start ."
"Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point ."
The first relates to the idea of civic education .
What stands out from Brexit is the gap between public perception and empirical reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies ?
"It has to begin with education , but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps ."
"In 2014 , the pollster Ipsos MORI published a survey on attitudes to immigration , and it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase , so public concern with immigration also increases , although it obviously didn &apos;t unpack causality , because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and media narrative around it ."
But the same survey also revealed huge public misinformation and misunderstanding about the nature of immigration .
"For example , in these attitudes in the United Kingdom , the public believed that levels of asylum were a greater proportion of immigration than they were , but they also believed the levels of educational migration were far lower as a proportion of overall migration than they actually are ."
"So we have to address this misinformation , the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization ."
"And that can &apos;t just be something that &apos;s left to our schools , although that &apos;s important to begin at an early age ."
The second thing that I think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities .
"So for instance , London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants , and they are also by far the most tolerant areas ."
It &apos;s those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration that actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants .
So we need to encourage exchange programs .
We need to ensure that older generations who maybe can &apos;t travel get access to the Internet .
This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking .
But the problem is that those people in those areas didn &apos;t perceive themselves to be beneficiaries .
They didn &apos;t believe that they were actually getting access to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world .
"I work on questions predominantly to do with refugees , and one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time preaching , mainly to developing countries around the world , is that in order to encourage the integration of refugees , we can &apos;t just benefit the refugee populations , we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas ."
"Furthermore , if we &apos;re going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits , our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they , too , have to take people with them ."
The fourth and final idea I want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization .
"We might not achieve that today , but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media to drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another ."
I am still British .
I am still European .
I am still a global citizen .
"For those of us who believe that our identities are not mutually exclusive , we have to all work together to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t leave people behind ."
Only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real pleasure to be here .
I last did a TED Talk I think about seven years ago or so .
I talked about spaghetti sauce .
"And so many people , I guess , watch those videos ."
"People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce , which is a wonderful thing in the short term — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s proven to be less than ideal over seven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me .
( Laughter ) The theme of this morning &apos;s session is Things We Make .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era .
And the man &apos;s name is Carl Norden .
Carl Norden was born in 1880 .
And he was Swiss .
"And of course , the Swiss can be divided into two general categories : those who make small , exquisite , expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small , exquisite , expensive objects ."
And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp .
He &apos;s an engineer .
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich .
"In fact , one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small , expensive , exquisite objects ."
"And he &apos;s a Swiss engineer , Carl ."
And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word .
"He wears three-piece suits ; and he has a very , very small , important mustache ; and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego ; and he works 16-hour days ; and he has very strong feelings about alternating current ; and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness ; and he drinks lots of coffee ; and he does his best work sitting in his mother &apos;s kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule ."
"In any case , Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan ."
And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before GPS and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plane that &apos;s thousands of feet up in the air , going at hundreds of miles an hour , and you &apos;re trying to drop an object , a bomb , towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments ."
"And all sorts of people , moving up to the First World War and between the wars , tried to solve this problem , and nearly everybody came up short ."
The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude .
But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code .
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device .
It weighs about 50 lbs .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings and gadgets and gauges .
And he makes this complicated thing .
"And what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object , visually sight the target , because they &apos;re in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber , and then they plug in the altitude of the plane , the speed of the plane , the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target ."
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb .
"And as Norden famously says , &quot; &quot; Before that bombsight came along , bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like manna from heaven .
"Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War , where millions of men fought each other in the trenches , getting nowhere , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy ."
And the U.S. military spends 1.5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 1940 dollars — developing the Norden bombsight .
"And to put that in perspective , the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars ."
Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .
"And there were people , strategists , within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese ."
"And for Norden as well , this device had incredible moral importance , because Norden was a committed Christian ."
"In fact , he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention , because in his eyes , only God could invent things ."
He was simply the instrument of God &apos;s will .
And what was God &apos;s will ?
Well God &apos;s will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb .
"So in the years leading up to the Second World War , the U.S. military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $ 14,000 each — again , in 1940 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them — long extensive , months-long training sessions — because these things are essentially analog computers ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath , to swear that if they &apos;re ever captured , they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy , because it &apos;s imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology ."
"And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane , it &apos;s escorted there by a series of armed guards ."
And it &apos;s carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it .
And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards .
It &apos;s never allowed to be photographed .
"And there &apos;s a little incendiary device inside of it , so that , if the plane ever crashes , it will be destroyed and there &apos;s no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it ."
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail .
So what happens during the Second World War ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the Holy Grail ."
"In practice , the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under perfect conditions ."
"And of course , in wartime , conditions aren &apos;t perfect ."
"First of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer ."
"Secondly , it breaks down a lot ."
"It &apos;s full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball-bearings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle ."
"Thirdly , when Norden was making his calculations , he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down ."
So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those conditions .
"But most of all , the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are clouds , right ."
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate .
Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was , there was a famous case in 1944 where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna , Germany ."
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres .
"And over the course of 22 bombing missions , the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs on this 757 acre chemical plant , using the Norden bombsight ."
Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that landed , 16 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were duds ."
"The Leuna chemical plant , after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war , was up and running within weeks ."
"And by the way , all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis ?"
"Well it turns out that Carl Norden , as a proper Swiss , was very enamored of German engineers ."
"So in the 1930s , he hired a whole bunch of them , including a man named Hermann Long who , in 1938 , gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis ."
"So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they &apos;ve invented gadgets that will forever change our world ."
They &apos;ve invented websites that will allow people to be free .
"They &apos;ve invented some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better ."
"If you go into the military , you &apos;ll find lots of Carl Nordens as well ."
"If you go to the Pentagon , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very clear about how little that means .
"In the Iraq War , at the beginning of the first Iraq War , the U.S. military , the air force , sent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor ."
"And their mission was to find and to destroy — remember the Scud missile launchers , those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis ?"
The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers .
"And so they flew missions day and night , and they dropped thousands of bombs , and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an audit done — as the army always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many Scuds did we actually destroy ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"Zero , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
Is it because their weapons weren &apos;t accurate ?
"Oh no , they were brilliantly accurate ."
"They could have destroyed this little thing right here from 25,000 ft ."
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the Scud launchers were .
"The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel , it &apos;s knowing how to find the pickle barrel ."
That &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
Or take the battle in Afghanistan .
What is the signature weapon of the CIA &apos;s war in Northwest Pakistan ?
It &apos;s the drone . What is the drone ?
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
"And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan , the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles , and it &apos;s used those drones to kill 2,000 suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants ."
Now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
We think we &apos;re now at 95 percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes .
"95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?"
That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare .
But do you know what the crucial thing is ?
"In that exact same period that we &apos;ve been using these drones with devastating accuracy , the number of attacks , of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks , against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold ."
"As we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them , they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us ."
I have not described to you a success story .
I &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that ."
"The issue isn &apos;t the accuracy of the bombs you have , it &apos;s how you use the bombs you have , and more importantly , whether you ought to use bombs at all ."
There &apos;s a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight .
"And that is , on August 6 , 1945 , a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima ."
"And as was typical with the Norden bombsight , the bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
"the air force &apos;s 1.5 billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all ."
"Meanwhile , back in New York , no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima ."
He was a committed Christian .
He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war .
It would have broken his heart .
( Applause )
"I admit that I &apos;m a little bit nervous here because I &apos;m going to say some radical things , about how we should think about cancer differently , to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do ."
But I will also contest that I &apos;m not as nervous as I should be because I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;m right about this .
"( Laughter ) And that this , in fact , will be the way that we treat cancer in the future ."
"In order to talk about cancer , I &apos;m going to actually have to — let me get the big slide here ."
"First , I &apos;m going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics ."
"I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on — and then talk about something you haven &apos;t heard so much about , which is proteomics ."
"Having explained those , that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer ."
So let me start with genomics .
It is the hot topic .
It is the place where we &apos;re learning the most .
This is the great frontier .
But it has its limitations .
"And in particular , you &apos;ve probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body , and if that were only true , it would be great , but it &apos;s not ."
It &apos;s like the parts list of your body .
"It doesn &apos;t say how things are connected , what causes what and so on ."
"So if I can make an analogy , let &apos;s say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant , a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant , and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder ."
"So it might be that , if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn &apos;t have butter , you could say , &quot; &quot; Ah , I see what &apos;s wrong with them ."
I can make them healthy . &quot; &quot; And there probably are special cases of that .
You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder .
"So the list of ingredients does tell you something , and sometimes it tells you something that &apos;s wrong ."
"If they have tons of salt , you might guess they &apos;re using too much salt , or something like that ."
"But it &apos;s limited , because really to know if it &apos;s a healthy restaurant , you need to taste the food , you need to know what goes on in the kitchen , you need the product of all of those ingredients ."
"So if I look at a person and I look at a person &apos;s genome , it &apos;s the same thing ."
The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
"And so indeed , there are times when we can find ingredients that &#91; are &#93; bad ."
"Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease , and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease ."
"But most things , you really have to know what &apos;s going on in the kitchen , because , mostly , sick people used to be healthy people — they have the same genome ."
So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition .
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list .
But you really for the most part can &apos;t tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person — except in some of these special cases .
So why all the big deal about genetics ?
"Well first of all , it &apos;s because we can read it , which is fantastic ."
It is very useful in certain circumstances .
It &apos;s also the great theoretical triumph of biology .
It &apos;s the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .
It &apos;s fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on .
And so it &apos;s the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct .
"So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing , and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing , and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one ."
So this happens in physics all the time .
"You predict a black hole , and you look out the telescope and there it is , just like you said ."
But it rarely happens in biology .
"So this great triumph — it &apos;s so good , there &apos;s almost a religious experience in biology ."
And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory .
"So the other reason it &apos;s been very popular is because we can measure it , it &apos;s digital ."
"And in fact , thanks to Kary Mullis , you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients ."
"So for instance , by measuring the genome , we &apos;ve learned a lot about how we &apos;re related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome , or how we &apos;re related to each other — the family tree , or the tree of life ."
There &apos;s a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity .
"Now of course , in medical application , that is very useful because it &apos;s the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history — except probably , your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do ."
"And so by reading the genome , we can find out much more about your family than you probably know ."
"And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives , but they may be surprising ."
I did the 23andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald .
( Laughter ) But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
"But mostly what you need to know , to find out if you &apos;re sick , is not your predispositions , but it &apos;s actually what &apos;s going on in your body right now ."
"So to do that , what you really need to do , you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what &apos;s happening after the genetics , and that &apos;s what proteomics is about ."
"Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes , proteomics is the study of all the proteins ."
"And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells — actually , the machines that are operating — that &apos;s where the action is ."
"Basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sick , something &apos;s gone wrong with that conversation ."
"And so the trick is — unfortunately , we don &apos;t have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome ."
"So the problem is that measuring — if you try to measure all the proteins , it &apos;s a very elaborate process ."
"It requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time ."
And it matters how much of the protein it is .
"It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent , so it &apos;s not a nice digital thing like DNA ."
"And basically our problem is somebody &apos;s in the middle of this very long stage , they pause for just a moment , and they leave something in an enzyme for a second , and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don &apos;t work ."
And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way .
People have tried very hard to do this .
I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it .
I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus .
"And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems , and I didn &apos;t think this was a very likely one to call back , so I kept on giving him to the delay list ."
"And then one day , I get a call from John Doerr , Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus &apos;s phone call ."
"( Laughter ) So I was like , &quot; &quot; Okay . This guy &apos;s at least resourceful . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we started talking , and he said , &quot; &quot; I really need a better way to measure proteins . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Looked at that . Been there ."
"Not going to be easy . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No , no . I really need it ."
"I mean , I see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them ."
We have to have a window into this . &quot; &quot; And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it .
"And I realized , wow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it , and so I said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s look at it . &quot; &quot; Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody &apos;s funding or permission or anything ."
So we started playing around with this .
"And as we did it , we realized this was the basic problem — that taking the sip of coffee — that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics ."
"And so we did that , and working with David , we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually , which makes this robotic assembly line , which , in a very consistent way , measures the protein ."
And I &apos;ll show you what that protein measurement looks like .
"Basically , what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient , and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh , how slippery they are , and we arrange them in an image ."
And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood .
"And we can take a different one tomorrow , and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different — they &apos;ll be different after you eat or after you sleep ."
They really tell us what &apos;s going on there .
"And so this picture , which looks like a big smudge to you , is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track ."
"So if I zoom into that picture , I can just show you what it means ."
"We sort out the proteins — from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we &apos;re getting , and from top to bottom is how slippery they are ."
So we &apos;re zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it .
And so each of these lines represents some signal that we &apos;re getting out of a piece of a protein .
"And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump , bump , bump , bump , bump ."
"And that &apos;s because we &apos;re measuring the weight so precisely that — carbon comes in different isotopes , so if it has an extra neutron on it , we actually measure it as a different chemical ."
So we &apos;re actually measuring each isotope as a different one .
And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .
"So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time , and suddenly you say , &quot; &quot; Wow , it &apos;s way more complicated than we thought it was . &quot; &quot; But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it ."
So this is the signature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
"So what we do with this is , for example , we can look at two patients , one that responded to a drug and one that didn &apos;t respond to a drug , and ask , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on differently inside of them ? &quot; &quot; And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences ."
So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red .
We overlay them . This is actual data .
"And you can see , mostly it overlaps and it &apos;s yellow , but there &apos;s some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has ."
"And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug , we see that in the blood , they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug ."
"We might not even know what this protein is , but we can see it &apos;s a marker for the response to the disease ."
"So this already , I think , is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine ."
But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we &apos;re going to treat cancer .
So let me move to cancer .
"The thing about cancer — when I got into this , I really knew nothing about it , but working with David Agus , I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out ."
"And as I looked at it , to me it didn &apos;t make sense how we were approaching cancer , and in order to make sense of it , I had to learn where did this come from ."
We &apos;re treating cancer almost like it &apos;s an infectious disease .
We &apos;re treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill .
So this is the great paradigm .
This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked — was the germ theory of disease .
"So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose — that is , put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis — and that works great for infectious diseases ."
"So if we put you in the category of you &apos;ve got syphilis , we can give you penicillin ."
We know that that works .
"If you &apos;ve got malaria , we give you quinine or some derivative of it ."
"And so that &apos;s the basic thing doctors are trained to do , and it &apos;s miraculous in the case of infectious disease — how well it works ."
And many people in this audience probably wouldn &apos;t be alive if doctors didn &apos;t do this .
But now let &apos;s apply that to systems diseases like cancer .
"The problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you ."
It &apos;s you ; you &apos;re broken .
That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way .
So how do we diagnose that conversation ?
"Well , right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body — you know , where did it appear ? — and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body ."
"And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer , and we treat these as if they &apos;re separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong ."
"And of course , it really doesn &apos;t have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system ."
"And in fact , I think we &apos;re even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing ."
I think this is the big mistake .
I think cancer should not be a noun .
"We should talk about cancering as something we do , not something we have ."
"And so those tumors , those are symptoms of cancer ."
"And so your body is probably cancering all the time , but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control ."
"And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb , imagine we didn &apos;t know anything about plumbing , and the way that we talked about it , we &apos;d come home and we &apos;d find a leak in our kitchen and we &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Oh , my house has water . &quot; &quot; We might divide it — the plumber would say , &quot; &quot; Well , where &apos;s the water ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s in the kitchen . &quot; &quot; Oh , you must have kitchen water . &quot;"
That &apos;s kind of the level at which it is .
"&quot; &quot; Kitchen water , well , first of all , we &apos;ll go in there and we &apos;ll mop out a lot of it ."
"And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen , that helps ."
"Whereas living room water , it &apos;s better to do tar on the roof . &quot; &quot; And it sounds silly , but that &apos;s basically what we do ."
"And I &apos;m not saying you shouldn &apos;t mop up your water if you have cancer , but I &apos;m saying that &apos;s not really the problem ; that &apos;s the symptom of the problem ."
"What we really need to get at is the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s happening at the level of the proteonomic actions , happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does ?"
"Because normally , your body is dealing with this problem all the time ."
"So your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it &apos;s fixing them . It &apos;s draining them out and so on ."
"So what we need is to have a causative model of what &apos;s actually going on , and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that ."
David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there .
"And so I gave this talk and said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you guys do this ? &quot; &quot; And Anna said , &quot; &quot; Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way ."
"But what we &apos;re going to do , is we &apos;re going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research . &quot; &quot; So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we &apos;ve got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world , from Cold Spring Harbor , Stanford , Austin — I won &apos;t even go through and name all the places — to have a research project that will last for five years where we &apos;re really going to try to build a model of cancer like this ."
"We &apos;re doing it in mice first , and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this , but they will die for a good cause ."
"And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand , when cancer happens , what &apos;s actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer ."
So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future .
"So I think eventually , once we have one of these models for people , which we &apos;ll get eventually — I mean , our group won &apos;t get all the way there — but eventually we &apos;ll have a very good computer model — sort of like a global climate model for weather ."
It has lots of different information about what &apos;s the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales .
"And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer — and this also will be for ALS , or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases , things like that — we will simulate specifically you , not just a generic person , but what &apos;s actually going on inside you ."
"And in that simulation , what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments , and it might be very gentle treatments , very small amounts of drugs ."
"It might be things like , don &apos;t eat that day , or give them a little chemotherapy , maybe a little radiation ."
"Of course , we &apos;ll do surgery sometimes and so on ."
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health — guide your body back to health .
Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong .
We put it in the equivalent of splints .
"And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer , and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job ."
And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future .
"It &apos;s going to require a lot of work , a lot of research ."
There will be many teams like our team that work on this .
"But I think eventually , we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer ."
So thank you very much .

"In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies , fathers are usually known by their sons , but I &apos;m one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter , and I am proud of it ."
"( Applause ) Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in 2007 , and when her efforts were honored in 2011 , and she was given the national youth peace prize , and she became a very famous , very popular young girl of her country ."
"Before that , she was my daughter , but now I am her father ."
"Ladies and gentlemen , if we glance to human history , the story of women is the story of injustice , inequality , violence and exploitation ."
"You see , in patriarchal societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her birth is not celebrated ."
"She is not welcomed , neither by father nor by mother ."
"The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father ."
And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child .
"When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad ."
"When she gives birth to the second daughter , she is shocked , and in the expectation of a son , when she gives birth to a third daughter , she feels guilty like a criminal ."
"Not only the mother suffers , but the daughter , the newly born daughter , when she grows old , she suffers too ."
"At the age of five , while she should be going to school , she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school ."
"Until the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life ."
She can have fun .
"She can play with her friends in the streets , and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly ."
"But when she enters her teens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort ."
She is confined under the four walls of her home .
She is no more a free individual .
"She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family , and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor , she could even be killed ."
"I know a family of seven sisters and one brother , and that one brother , he has migrated to the Gulf countries , to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents , because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood ."
"So this brother , he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called honor ."
And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience .
"A good girl is supposed to be very quiet , very humble and very submissive ."
It is the criteria .
The role model good girl should be very quiet .
"She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them ."
"If she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient ."
"If she is married very early , she has to accept ."
"Otherwise , she will be called disobedient ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a poetess , she is wedded , bedded , and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters ."
"And it is the irony of the situation that this mother , she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons ."
"And this vicious cycle goes on , goes on ."
"Ladies and gentlemen , this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently , if women and men think differently , if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries , if they can break a few norms of family and society , if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states , which go against the basic human rights of the women ."
"Dear brothers and sisters , when Malala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like newborn children , to be honest , but when I went and I looked into her eyes , believe me , I got extremely honored ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan ."
"Her name was Malalai of Maiwand , and I named my daughter after her ."
"A few days after Malala was born , my daughter was born , my cousin came — and it was a coincidence — he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the Yousafzai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors ."
"But when I looked , all were men , and I picked my pen , drew a line from my name , and wrote , &quot; &quot; Malala . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I admitted her in my school ."
"You will be asking , then , why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school ?"
"Yes , I must mention it ."
"It may be taken for granted in Canada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patriarchal societies , in tribal societies , it &apos;s a big event for the life of girl ."
Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name .
Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life .
"I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and you will be astonished , two weeks before , when I was filling out the Canadian visa form , and I was filling out the family part of the form , I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters ."
"And the reason was that I have never , never seen the names of my sisters written on any document ."
That was the reason that I valued my daughter .
"What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter .
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings .
"And all these good values , I tried to inculcate in her personality ."
"And this was not only she , only Malala ."
"I imparted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well ."
I used education for emancipation .
"I taught my girls , I taught my girl students , to unlearn the lesson of obedience ."
I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor .
"Dear brothers and sisters , we were striving for more rights for women , and we were struggling to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new phenomenon .
It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women &apos;s rights .
It was called Talibanization .
"It means a complete negation of women &apos;s participation in all political , economical and social activities ."
Hundreds of schools were lost .
Girls were prohibited from going to school .
Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets .
"Musicians were silenced , girls were flogged and singers were killed ."
It &apos;s really the most scary thing .
"She wrote a diary for the BBC blog , she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries , and she spoke from every platform she could ."
And her voice was the most powerful voice .
It spread like a crescendo all around the world .
"And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign , and on October 9 2012 , she was shot in the head at point blank range ."
It was a doomsday for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black hole .
"While my daughter was on the verge of life and death , I whispered into the ears of my wife , &quot; &quot; Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she abruptly told me , &quot; &quot; Please don &apos;t blame yourself ."
You stood for the right cause .
"You put your life at stake for the cause of truth , for the cause of peace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you ."
"You both were on the right path and God will protect her . &quot; &quot; These few words meant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When Malala was in the hospital , and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down , I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife ."
But my daughter never complained .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be okay . Please don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; She was a solace for us , and she consoled us ."
"Dear brothers and sisters , we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women , she is like any 16-year old girl ."
She cries when her homework is incomplete .
"She quarrels with her brothers , and I am very happy for that ."
"People ask me , what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
Ask me what I did not do .
"I did not clip her wings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
"When we go to the physician today — when we go to the doctor &apos;s office and we walk in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
"Diabetes , cancer , Parkinson &apos;s , Alzheimer &apos;s , heart failure , lung failure — things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there &apos;s relatively little that can be done ."
"And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn &apos;t , and where we are clinically today , and where we might go tomorrow , and what some of the hurdles are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 18 minutes , I promise ."
"I want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it ."
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a damaged hip , you can put an artificial hip in ."
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that theme a few times — instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue ."
"So that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment ."
Very few good ideas — if you agree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are truly novel .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Charles Lindbergh , who was better known for flying airplanes , was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel , one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller , to begin to think about , could you culture organs ?"
"And they published this book in 1937 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe ."
"One of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older ."
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65 .
"And you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again , maybe a little bit of asthma ."
"If the average age in your country is 45 to 55 , now the average person is looking at diabetes , early-onset diabetes , heart failure , coronary artery disease — things that are inherently more difficult to treat , and much more expensive to treat ."
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot; &quot; In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree ."
"41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease ."
"In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S."
"And this is matched in every industrialized , wealthy country in the world ."
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age versus cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a sudden spike in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . If you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care , plotted over your lifetime ."
"And about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a spike ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging ."
"I &apos;d suggest there are four things , and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system ."
All those things do is change who pays .
They don &apos;t actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that anymore . It &apos;s too depressing .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom ."
"Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance ."
"Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?"
"We diagnose the disease eventually , once it becomes symptomatic , and then we treat the symptom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do OK . Insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
"But eventually it stops working , and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease ."
"Why couldn &apos;t we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symptomatic ?"
"And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different ."
"This video , I think , gets across the concept that I &apos;m talking about quite dramatically ."
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
"If a newt can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body , for tissues and for organs themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life ."
"I would pose to you that tomorrow — and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it &apos;s within the foreseeable future — we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation ."
"There &apos;s a limb prosthetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that &apos;s come back from Iraq ."
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs .
"Imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb ."
It &apos;s a wild concept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .
"But it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus .
"A mammalian fetus , if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy , will re-grow that limb ."
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lose their fingertip in an accident , they &apos;ll re-grow their fingertip ."
"By the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that anymore ."
"So to engage in that conversation with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body .
The first is cellular therapies .
"Clearly , we heal ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Therefore , if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body , they may do the healing ."
"Secondly , we can use materials ."
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
"If we can invent materials , design materials , or extract materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself ."
"And finally , we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materials ."
Steve Badylak — who &apos;s at the University of Pittsburgh — about a decade ago had a remarkable idea .
"And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and I place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it weren &apos;t compelling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a compelling picture .
"( Laughter ) However , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish — even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends — the lights are down . This is a good time to look at your feet , check your Blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
And although — it &apos;s good to laugh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diabetes .
"I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics , diabetic ulcers , we just don &apos;t connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment , which is amputation , if you can &apos;t heal it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the slide up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
"This is an older lady . She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body intact ."
"And this lady decided , after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer , that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented ."
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
"If the horse was in pain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this slide ."
The horse just has another nostril that &apos;s developed because of a riding accident .
"Just a few weeks after treatment — in this case , taking that material , turning it into a gel , and packing that area , and then repeating the treatment a few times — and the horse heals up ."
"And if you took an ultrasound of that area , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
"There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds ."
Could you regenerate a limb ?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
This is a 78 year-old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fingertip .
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
There are materials that do this . Here are the heart patches .
But could you go a little further ?
"Could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio-degradable material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
"He chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish ."
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cell-based regeneration .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient .
"Again , if you &apos;re squeamish , you don &apos;t want to watch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
"So this is a bypass operation , just like what Al Gore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the bypass operation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient ."
And I &apos;m standing up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"Here go the stem cells , right into the beating heart of the patient ."
"And if you look really carefully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a back-flush ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sorts of new technology , new devices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a randomized trial .
At this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"Basically , if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass , for these particular patients , they became asymptomatic ."
These are now two years out .
"The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early , and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those details , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less sick , and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy ."
"Here &apos;s another example of stem-cell therapy that isn &apos;t quite clinical yet , but I think very soon will be ."
"This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that liposuction fluid , which — in the United States , we have a lot of liposuction fluid ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
"So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck ."
"Out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons ."
All done in the lab .
"And I think fairly soon , you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived , or adipose-derived , stem cells ."
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
"We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army , who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq ."
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about burn , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
Everything that is done to treat burn — basically we do a sodding approach .
"We make something over here , and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , wearable bio-reactor has been designed — it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR — by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh ."
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
The gun that you see there sprays cells .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
"The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment , deliver other things as well at the same time , and therefore we will seed that lawn , as opposed to try the sodding approach ."
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
"So let me finish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no coincidence .
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
So they &apos;re putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area .
"The European Union , same thing ."
"China , the same thing ."
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
"( Laughter ) Oh , for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president ."
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .
"And I &apos;m going to finish up with a quote , maybe a little cheap shot , at the director of the NIH , who &apos;s a very charming man ."
"Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very testy meeting , what the NIH director said was , &quot; Your vision is larger than our appetite . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to close by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his appetite ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request .
"I &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40 .
"Up until that moment , I had been that classic corporate warrior — I was eating too much , I was drinking too much , I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance ."
"So I stepped back from the workforce , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children ."
But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance ."
And I have four observations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an honest debate ."
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
"All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue , which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family ."
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &apos;t need to impress people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and &#91; a &#93; T-shirt isn &apos;t really getting to the nub of the issue . ( Laughter )
The second observation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren &apos;t going to solve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead .
"If you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance ."
"It &apos;s particularly important — this isn &apos;t on the World Wide Web , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fired — it &apos;s particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies — the &quot; &quot; abattoirs of the human soul , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their DNA ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-intentioned companies ."
"On the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened ."
"On the other hand , it &apos;s a nightmare — it just means you spend more time at the bloody office ."
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life .
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance .
"Before I went back to work after my year at home , I sat down and I wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to ."
And it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night &apos;s sleep .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
( Laughter ) Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
( Applause ) How often do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , I &apos;ve got no mates or interests left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too short ; &quot; &quot; after I retire &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A fourth observation : We need to approach balance in a balanced way .
"A friend came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story — a friend came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; Nigel , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
I work 10 hours a day ; I commute two hours a day .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a grip and sort it out .
"So I joined a gym . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mock , but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn &apos;t more balanced ; it &apos;s more fit . ( Laughter )"
"Lovely though physical exercise may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the intellectual side ; there &apos;s the emotional side ; there &apos;s the spiritual side ."
"And to be balanced , I believe we have to attend to all of those areas — not just do 50 stomach crunches ."
Now that can be daunting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; Bloody hell mate , I haven &apos;t got time to get fit ."
You want me to go to church and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be daunting .
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective .
"My wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; &quot; Nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; &quot; — Harry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening ."
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates .
"We walked down to the local park , messed around on the swings , played some silly games ."
"I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe , and we shared a pizza for two , then walked down the hill to our home , and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas ."
"I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl &apos;s &quot; &quot; James and the Giant Peach . &quot; &quot; I then put him to bed , tucked him in , gave him a kiss on his forehead and said , &quot; &quot; Goodnight , mate , &quot; &quot; and walked out of his bedroom ."
"As I was walking out of his bedroom , he said , &quot; &quot; Dad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Yes , mate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; Dad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t done anything , hadn &apos;t taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
Being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
"With the smallest investment in the right places , you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life ."
"Moreover , I think , it can transform society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea worth spreading ."
( Applause )
I moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve invaded every country we &apos;ve encountered .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s leaving millions of children behind .
It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg .
America spends more money on education than most other countries .
Class sizes are smaller than in many countries .
"The trouble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direction ."
"There are three principles on which human life flourishes , and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure ."
How about two children or more ? Right .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
Aren &apos;t they ?
What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement .
I &apos;m not here to argue against science and math .
"A real education has to give equal weight to the arts , the humanities , to physical education ."
ADHD .
"It &apos;s a real achievement to put that particular ability out , or to stifle it ."
Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools .
"An old friend of mine — actually very old , he &apos;s dead ."
There he is . He &apos;s dieting .
The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning .
They should be diagnostic . They should help .
"So in place of curiosity , what we have is a culture of compliance ."
Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity .
"I mean , you may have a dog ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t listen to Radiohead , does it ?"
"Instead , what we have is a culture of standardization ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in Finland .
Many states in America have fewer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sailing into a headwind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography .
They may find it boring .
They &apos;re very personalized .
And they work .
"Culture is an organic term , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the winter of 2004 , it rained in Death Valley ."
Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period .
The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while .
Great leaders know that .
"And if the movement is strong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a revolution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people reach success and then fail ?
"One of the big reasons is , we think success is a one-way street ."
"So we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . We figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go downhill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"Reaching success , I worked hard , I pushed myself ."
"But then I stopped , because I figured , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I made it ."
"I can just sit back and relax . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I always tried to improve and do good work ."
"But then I stopped because I figured , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I stopped , because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like magic ."
And the only thing that came was creative block .
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"Reaching success , I always focused on clients and projects , and ignored the money . Then all this money started pouring in ."
And I got distracted by it .
"And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent , when I should have been talking to my clients ."
"And reaching success , I always did what I loved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like management . I am the world &apos;s worst manager , but I figured I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the president of the company ."
"Well , soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was , outwardly very successful , but inwardly very depressed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fix it .
I bought a fast car .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was faster but just as depressed .
"So I went to my doctor . I said , &quot; &quot; Doc , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depressed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy Prozac . &quot; &quot; And he put me on anti-depressants ."
"And yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just floating along . I couldn &apos;t care less if clients ever called ."
( Laughter ) And clients didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer serving them , I was only serving myself ."
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for business to drop like a rock ."
"My partner and I , Thom , we had to let all our employees go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no employees , there was nobody for me to manage ."
So I went back to doing the projects I loved .
"I had fun again , I worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , business grew bigger than ever ."
"And when I went back to following these eight principles , the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether ."
"And I woke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need Prozac anymore . &quot;"
And I threw it away and haven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a continuous journey .
"And if we want to avoid &quot; &quot; success-to-failure-syndrome , &quot; &quot; we just keep following these eight principles , because that is not only how we achieve success , it &apos;s how we sustain it ."
So here is to your continued success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Can we , as adults , grow new nerve cells ?"
"There &apos;s still some confusion about that question , as this is a fairly new field of research ."
"For example , I was talking to one of my colleagues , Robert , who is an oncologist , and he was telling me , &quot; &quot; Sandrine , this is puzzling ."
"Some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression . &quot; &quot; And I responded to him , &quot; &quot; Well , from my point of view that makes sense ."
"The drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain . &quot; &quot; And then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said , &quot; &quot; But Sandrine , these are adult patients — adults do not grow new nerve cells . &quot; &quot; And much to his surprise , I said , &quot; &quot; Well actually , we do . &quot; &quot; And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis ."
"&#91; Neurogenesis &#93; Now Robert is not a neuroscientist , and when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now — that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells ."
"So Robert , you know , being the good doctor that he is , wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better ."
And I took him for a tour of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis — and this is the hippocampus .
So this is this gray structure in the center of the brain .
"And what we &apos;ve known already for very long , is that this is important for learning , memory , mood and emotion ."
"However , what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated ."
"And if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in , what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain ."
"So when it comes to the human brain — my colleague Jonas Frisén from the Karolinska Institutet , has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus ."
"You might think this is not much , compared to the billions of neurons we have ."
"But by the time we turn 50 , we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons ."
So why are these new neurons important and what are their functions ?
"First , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and memory ."
"And this is especially new and true for spatial recognition — so like , how you navigate your way in the city ."
And more interesting to my colleague Robert is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression .
"And if we give antidepressants , then we increase the production of these newborn neurons , and we decrease the symptoms of depression , establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression ."
"But moreover , if you just block neurogenesis , then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant ."
"So by then , Robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer , because the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated ."
And it will take time to generate new neurons that reach normal functions .
"So , collectively , now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood , or even prevent the decline associated with aging , or associated with stress ."
So the next question is : can we control neurogenesis ?
The answer is yes .
And we are now going to do a little quiz .
"I &apos;m going to give you a set of behaviors and activities , and you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis ."
Are we ready ?
"OK , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
Increasing ?
Yes .
Learning will increase the production of these new neurons .
How about stress ?
"Yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus ."
How about sleep deprivation ?
"Indeed , it will decrease neurogenesis ."
How about sex ?
"Oh , wow !"
"( Laughter ) Yes , you are right , it will increase the production of new neurons ."
"However , it &apos;s all about balance here ."
We don &apos;t want to fall in a situation — ( Laughter ) about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation . ( Laughter )
How about getting older ?
"So the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older , but it is still occurring ."
"And then finally , how about running ?"
I will let you judge that one by yourself .
And here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage .
And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be .
"And now , you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage ."
"So activity impacts neurogenesis , but that &apos;s not all ."
What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
So here we have a sample of diet — of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy .
And I &apos;m just going to point a few out to you : Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis .
Intermittent fasting — spacing the time between your meals — will increase neurogenesis .
"Intake of flavonoids , which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries , will increase neurogenesis ."
"Omega-3 fatty acids , present in fatty fish , like salmon , will increase the production of these new neurons ."
"Conversely , a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis ."
Ethanol — intake of alcohol — will decrease neurogenesis .
"However , not everything is lost ; resveratrol , which is contained in red wine , has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons ."
"So next time you are at a dinner party , you might want to reach for this possibly &quot; &quot; neurogenesis-neutral &quot; &quot; drink ."
"( Laughter ) And then finally , let me point out the last one — a quirky one ."
"So Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures , and they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis , as opposed to food that requires mastication — chewing — or crunchy food ."
"So all of this data , where we need to look at the cellular level , has been generated using animal models ."
"But this diet has also been given to human participants , and what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis , such as : calorie restriction will improve memory capacity , whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression — as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids , which increase neurogenesis , and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression ."
"So we think that the effect of diet on mental health , on memory and mood , is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus ."
"On our side — neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis — we need to understand better the function of these new neurons , and how we can control their survival and their production ."
We also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of Robert &apos;s patients .
And on your side — I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) Margaret Heffernan : Fantastic research , Sandrine ."
"Now , I told you you changed my life — I now eat a lot of blueberries ."
Sandrine Thuret : Very good .
MH : I &apos;m really interested in the running thing .
Do I have to run ?
"Or is it really just about aerobic exercise , getting oxygen to the brain ?"
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise ?
"ST : So for the moment , we can &apos;t really say if it &apos;s just the running itself , but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production — or moving the blood flow to the brain , should be beneficial ."
MH : So I don &apos;t have to get a running wheel in my office ?
"Sandrine Thuret , thank you so much ."
"ST : Thank you , Margaret ."
( Applause )
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage ."
"I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 300 years ago , and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The British Empire &quot; &quot; &#93; Imagine trying to run the show , trying to run the entire planet , without computers , without telephones , with data handwritten on pieces of paper , and traveling by ships ."
But the Victorians actually did it .
What they did was amazing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
"In order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine .
They must be identical to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good handwriting , because the data is handwritten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multiplication , division , addition and subtraction in their head ."
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional .
The Victorians were great engineers .
"They engineered a system that was so robust that it &apos;s still with us today , continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists ."
"The empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; Schools as we know them are obsolete &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong comment there .
"I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re obsolete ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re broken .
It &apos;s quite fashionable to say that the education system &apos;s broken .
It &apos;s not broken . It &apos;s wonderfully constructed .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it anymore . It &apos;s outdated .
What are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
"Well , the clerks are the computers ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every office .
And you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs .
Those people don &apos;t need to be able to write beautifully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read discerningly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wherever they want , whenever they want , in whatever way they want ."
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
"Well , I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident ."
"I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi , 14 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a slum ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?"
Or should they not ?
"At the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers ."
"And my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
"I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Internet was ."
The children came running in .
"It was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we touch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you wish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"About eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s impossible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; My colleagues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solution ."
"One of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I repeated the experiment . I went 300 miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little . ( Laughter ) I repeated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to stay , so I stuck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a faster processor and a better mouse . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an irritated voice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; teach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so casually ."
Here &apos;s a short glimpse from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the Hole in the Wall .
On your right is an eight-year-old .
To his left is his student . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teaching her how to browse .
"Then onto other parts of the country , I repeated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; Hole in the wall film - 1999 &quot; &quot; &#93; An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do .
"And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a processor inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publishing ."
"I published everywhere . I wrote down and measured everything , and I said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was curious to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation ."
"There &apos;s one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad , and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs ."
"I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; Keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this ."
Computer : Nice to meet you.Child : Nice to meet you .
Sugata Mitra : The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her .
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Where does it stop ?
I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition .
"I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis ."
"Tamil is a south Indian language , and I said , can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a zero ."
"I &apos;ll spend a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another zero ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the lab and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called Kallikuppam in southern India .
"I put in Hole in the Wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came rushing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very topical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and diagrams and chemistry ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pedagogical method , so I applied that . I said , &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t the foggiest idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And anyway , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a zero . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I expect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We haven &apos;t given up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken Tamil and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease , we haven &apos;t understood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I tested them ."
"I got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a decade ahead of their time ."
Absurd . But I had to follow the Victorian norm .
Thirty percent is a fail .
How do I get them to pass ? I have to get them 20 more marks .
"I couldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a friend that they had , a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time ."
"So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; Absolutely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . Use the method of the grandmother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Stand behind them ."
"Whenever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , wow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next page ? Gosh , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what grannies do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The scores jumped to 50 percent .
"Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher ."
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field .
Here &apos;s Kallikuppam .
( Children speaking ) Neurons ... communication .
"I got the camera angle wrong . That one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate ."
At 12 .
So what are jobs going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand ."
What will it be tomorrow ?
Could it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"Could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"Could it be — a devastating question , a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte — could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete ?"
But that &apos;s terrible . We are homo sapiens .
"Knowing , that &apos;s what distinguishes us from the apes ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens .
"It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete ."
What an achievement that is .
But we have to integrate that into our own future .
Encouragement seems to be the key .
"If you look at Kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , &quot; &quot; saluting learning ."
There is evidence from neuroscience .
"The reptilian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s threatened , it shuts down everything else , it shuts down the prefrontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shuts all of that down ."
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
"We take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; Perform . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat .
"When you &apos;re standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you &apos;re okay , you &apos;ve passed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you failed ."
But the Age of Empires is gone .
What happens to creativity in our age ?
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers .
"I put out notices in papers saying , if you are a British grandmother , if you have broadband and a web camera , can you give me one hour of your time per week for free ?"
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the Granny Cloud .
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet .
"If there &apos;s a child in trouble , we beam a Gran ."
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England , deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu , India , 6,000 miles away ."
She does it with only one age-old gesture .
&quot; Shhh . &quot;
Okay ?
Watch this .
Grandmother : You can &apos;t catch me . You say it . You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me . Grandmother : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man.Children : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man . Grandmother : Well done ! Very good . SM : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization .
"If you allow the educational process to self-organize , then learning emerges ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about letting it happen .
The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments ."
"They are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together ."
"I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools ."
"It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of stand back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a SOLE in action ."
( Children talking ) This one is in England .
"He maintains law and order , because remember , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
Girl : The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons — SM : Australia Girl : — giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge .
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
SM : A decade ahead of her time .
"So SOLEs , I think we need a curriculum of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , &quot; What are those twinkling lights ? &quot;"
"They built the first curriculum , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those wondrous questions ."
We &apos;ve brought it down to the tangent of an angle .
But that &apos;s not sexy enough .
"The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say , &quot; &quot; If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth , how would you figure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a magic word . It &apos;s called the tangent of an angle , &quot; &quot; and leave him alone . He &apos;ll figure it out ."
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs .
"I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; When did the world begin ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to nine-year-olds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer ."
So what &apos;s my wish ?
My wish is that we design the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be spare parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to design a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — hang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wording exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together .
Help me build this school .
It will be called the School in the Cloud .
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a facility where I can study this .
It &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
There &apos;s only one granny who manages health and safety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cloud .
"The lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything &apos;s done from the cloud ."
But I want you for another purpose .
"You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clubs ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it .
"If you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the School of Clouds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my wish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the Himalayas .
"At 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , I once built two Hole in the Wall computers , and the children flocked there ."
And there was this little girl who was following me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly ."
"She suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; Get on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good advice .
I &apos;ll follow her advice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . Wow . ( Applause )
I want to talk to you about something kind of big .
We &apos;ll start here .
65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day .
"( Laughter ) A chunk of rock six miles across , moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet , slammed into the Earth ."
"It released its energy all at once , and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing ."
"If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War , lumped them together and blew them up at the same time , that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment ."
The dinosaurs had a really bad day .
Okay ?
"Now , a six-mile-wide rock is very large ."
We all live here in Boulder .
"If you look out your window and you can see Long &apos;s Peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it ."
"Now , scoop up Long &apos;s Peak , and put it out in space ."
"Take Meeker , Mt . Meeker . Lump that in there , and put that in space as well , and Mt . Everest , and K2 , and the Indian peaks ."
"Then you &apos;re starting to get an idea of how much rock we &apos;re talking about , okay ?"
We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left .
"It hit in what we now know as Yucatan , the Gulf of Mexico ."
"You can see here , there &apos;s the Yucatan Peninsula , if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there ."
Here is how big of a crater was left .
"It was huge . To give you a sense of the scale , okay , there you go . The scale here is 50 miles on top , a hundred kilometers on the bottom . This thing was 300 kilometers across — 200 miles — an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet , threw up enough dust to block out the sun ."
It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth .
"Now , not all asteroids are that big ."
Some of them are smaller .
Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992 .
It came in on a Friday night .
Why is that important ?
"Because back then , video cameras were just starting to become popular , and people would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; football games to film their kids play football . And since this came in on a Friday , they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina , Maryland , Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York ."
"( Laughter ) Now , this is not a 200-mile-wide crater , but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here , about the size of a football , that hit that car and did that damage ."
Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in .
"It broke up through atmospheric pressure , it crumbled , and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage ."
"Now , you wouldn &apos;t want that falling on your foot or your head , because it would do that to it ."
That would be bad .
"But it won &apos;t wipe out , you know , all life on Earth , so that &apos;s fine . But it turns out , you don &apos;t need something six miles across to do a lot of damage ."
"There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock , and in fact , if any of you have ever been to near Winslow , Arizona , there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater ."
"To give you a sense of scale , this is about a mile wide ."
"If you look up at the top , that &apos;s a parking lot , and those are recreational vehicles right there ."
"So it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep ."
"The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across , so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here ."
"It came in at speeds that were tremendous , slammed into the ground , blew up , and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb — a very hefty bomb ."
"This was 50,000 years ago , so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope , or something like that out in the desert , but it probably would not have caused global devastation ."
It turns out that these things don &apos;t have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage .
"Now , in 1908 , over Siberia , near the Tunguska region — for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw &quot; &quot; Ghostbusters , &quot; &quot; when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of 1909 , where he got the date wrong , but that &apos;s okay . ( Laughter ) It was 1908 . That &apos;s fine . I can live with that . ( Laughter )"
"Another rock came into the Earth &apos;s atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground , several miles up above the surface of the Earth ."
"The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it , and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles , okay ?"
This did a huge amount of damage .
"And again , this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we &apos;re sitting in ."
"In Meteor Crater it was made of metal , and metal is much tougher , so it made it to the ground ."
"The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock , and that &apos;s much more crumbly , so it blew up in the air . Either way , these are tremendous explosions , 20 megatons ."
"Now , when these things blow up , they &apos;re not going to do global ecological damage ."
They &apos;re not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did .
They &apos;re just not big enough .
"But they will do global economic damage , because they don &apos;t have to hit , necessarily , to do this kind of damage ."
They don &apos;t have to do global devastation .
"If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere , it would cause a panic ."
"But if it came over a city , an important city — not that any city is more important than others , but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis — that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization ."
"So , now that I &apos;ve scared the crap out of you ..."
( Laughter ) what can we do about this ? All right ?
This is a potential threat .
Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years . They &apos;re very rare .
"The smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years , but it &apos;s still something to be aware of ."
"Well , what do we do about them ?"
The first thing we have to do is find them .
This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009 .
It &apos;s right here .
But you can see that it &apos;s extremely faint .
I don &apos;t even know if you can see that in the back row . These are just stars .
"This is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago ."
These things are faint .
"They &apos;re hard to see , and the sky is really big ."
We have to find these things first .
"Well the good news is , we &apos;re looking for them ."
NASA has devoted money to this .
"The National Science Foundation , other countries are very interested in doing this ."
"We &apos;re building telescopes that are looking for the threat . That &apos;s a great first step , but what &apos;s the second step ? The second step is that we see one heading toward us , we have to stop it . What do we do ?"
"You &apos;ve probably heard about the asteroid Apophis . If you haven &apos;t yet , you will ."
"If you &apos;ve heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse , you &apos;re going to hear about Apophis , because you &apos;re keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway ."
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004 .
"It &apos;s roughly 250 yards across , so it &apos;s pretty big — big size , you know , bigger than a football stadium — and it &apos;s going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029 ."
And it &apos;s going to pass us so close that it &apos;s actually going to come underneath our weather satellites .
"The Earth &apos;s gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it &apos;s just right , if it passes through this region of space , this kidney bean-shaped region called the keyhole , the Earth &apos;s gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April 13 , which is a Friday , I &apos;ll note , in the year 2036 ... ( Laughter ) — you can &apos;t plan that kind of stuff — Apophis is going to hit us . And it &apos;s 250 meters across , so it would do unbelievable damage ."
"Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million , roughly — very , very low odds , so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all ."
I don &apos;t think Apophis is a problem .
"In fact , Apophis is a blessing in disguise , because it woke us up to the dangers of these things ."
This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now .
"It won &apos;t , but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids . We didn &apos;t really necessarily understand these keyholes , and now we do and it turns out that &apos;s really important , because how do you stop an asteroid like this ?"
"Well , let me ask you , what happens if you &apos;re standing in the middle of the road and a car &apos;s headed for you ? What do you do ? You do this ."
Right ? Move . The car goes past you .
"But we can &apos;t move the Earth , at least not easily , but we can move a small asteroid ."
"And it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it ."
"In the year 2005 , NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact , which slammed into — slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet ."
Comets are very much like asteroids .
The purpose wasn &apos;t to push it out of the way .
"The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet , which we learned quite a bit about ."
"We did move the comet a little tiny bit , not very much , but that wasn &apos;t the point ."
"However , think about this ."
"This thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second , 20 miles per second ."
We shot a space probe at it and hit it . Okay ?
"Imagine how hard that must be , and we did it ."
That means we can do it again .
"If we need , if we see an asteroid that &apos;s coming toward us , and it &apos;s headed right for us , and we have two years to go , boom ! We hit it ."
"You can try to — you know , if you watch the movies , you might think about , why don &apos;t we use a nuclear weapon ?"
"It &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is timing ."
"You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing , you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you &apos;ll just miss it ."
And there are a lot of other problems with that . It &apos;s very hard to do .
But just hitting something ? That &apos;s pretty easy .
"I think even NASA can do that , and they proved that they can . ( Laughter ) The problem is , what happens if you hit this asteroid , you &apos;ve changed the orbit , you measure the orbit and then you find out , oh , yeah , we just pushed it into a keyhole , and now it &apos;s going to hit us in three years ."
"Well , my opinion is , fine . Okay ?"
It &apos;s not hitting us in six months . That &apos;s good .
Now we have three years to do something else .
"And you can hit it again . That &apos;s kind of ham-fisted . You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever , so you don &apos;t do that ."
"And this is the part , it &apos;s the part I just love ."
"( Laughter ) After the big macho &quot; &quot; Rrrrrrr BAM ! We &apos;re gonna hit this thing in the face , &quot; &quot; then we bring in the velvet gloves . ( Laughter )"
"There &apos;s a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation . For those of you who &apos;ve read &quot; &quot; The Little Prince , &quot; &quot; you understand that reference , I hope . The little prince who lived on an asteroid , it was called B612 ."
"These are smart guys — men and women — astronauts , like I said , engineers ."
"Rusty Schweickart , who was an Apollo 9 astronaut , is on this . Dan Durda , my friend who made this image , works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , on Walnut Street . He created this image for this , and he &apos;s actually one of the astronomers who works for them . If we see an asteroid that &apos;s going to hit the Earth and we have enough time , we can hit it to move it into a better orbit . But then what we do is we launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two ."
"It doesn &apos;t have to be huge — couple of tons , not that big — and you park it near the asteroid ."
"You don &apos;t land on it , because these things are tumbling end over end . It &apos;s very hard to land on them ."
Instead you get near it .
"The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe , and the probe has a couple of tons of mass ."
"It has a little tiny bit of gravity , but it &apos;s enough that it can pull the asteroid , and you have your rockets set up , so you can — oh , you can barely see it here , but there &apos;s rocket plumes — and you basically , these guys are connected by their own gravity , and if you move the probe very slowly , very , very gently , you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit ."
"You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it , although that &apos;s a whole other thing . I won &apos;t go into that ."
( Laughter ) But we &apos;d be rich ! ( Laughter )
"So think about this , right ?"
"There are these giant rocks flying out there , and they &apos;re hitting us , and they &apos;re doing damage to us , but we &apos;ve figured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this ."
"We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them . We have smart people , very , very smart people , who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem , and we have the technology to do this ."
This probe actually can &apos;t use chemical rockets .
"Chemical rockets provide too much thrust , too much push . The probe would just shoot away ."
"We invented something called an ion drive , which is a very , very , very low-thrust engine ."
"It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand , incredibly light , but it can run for months and years , providing that very gentle push ."
"If anybody here is a fan of the original &quot; &quot; Star Trek , &quot; &quot; they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive , and Spock said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re very technically sophisticated ."
"They &apos;re a hundred years ahead of us with this drive . &quot; &quot; Yeah , we have an ion drive now . ( Laughter ) We don &apos;t have the Enterprise , but we &apos;ve got an ion drive now ."
( Applause ) Spock .
( Laughter ) So ...
"that &apos;s the difference , that &apos;s the difference between us and the dinosaurs ."
This happened to them .
It doesn &apos;t have to happen to us .
"The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote , and so we can change our future ."
( Laughter ) We have the ability to change our future .
"65 million years from now , we don &apos;t have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galaxy , the Milky Way Galaxy ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy .
"And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shutter open , as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope , it will see something like this ."
Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way — a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs .
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in dog years ."
( Laughter ) Which tells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it .
It &apos;s extremely beautiful .
"I &apos;ve often wondered , what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a cosmologist , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you ."
"And if you look at a galaxy even farther away , it would be moving away faster ."
So we say the universe is expanding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together ."
"In the past , the universe was more dense , and it was also hotter ."
"If you squeeze things together , the temperature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , near the Big Bang , was also very , very smooth ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
The air in this room is very smooth .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just smoothed themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the conditions near the Big Bang are very , very different than the conditions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot denser ."
The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"At early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big — literally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections , without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole ."
"Keeping the universe very , very smooth at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a delicate arrangement ."
It &apos;s a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann , an Austrian physicist in the 19th century ."
And Boltzmann &apos;s contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the randomness , the disorder , the chaoticness of some systems ."
Boltzmann gave us a formula — engraved on his tombstone now — that really quantifies what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don &apos;t notice , so that macroscopically it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t notice each individual atom ."
A low entropy configuration is one in which there &apos;s only a few arrangements that look that way .
A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
"This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics — the law that says that entropy increases in the universe , or in some isolated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful insight , but it leaves something out ."
"This insight that entropy increases , by the way , is what &apos;s behind what we call the arrow of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing — the fact that you can remember the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increasing ."
"Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very , very smooth ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cosmologists .
"Unfortunately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough attention to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cosmologist , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to address ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman .
"50 years ago , he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures ."
"He gave the popular lectures that became &quot; &quot; The Character of Physical Law . &quot; &quot; He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became &quot; &quot; The Feynman Lectures on Physics . &quot; &quot; He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became &quot; &quot; The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation . &quot; &quot; In every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the accent — he says , &quot; &quot; For some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy content , and since then the entropy has increased ."
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; Surely , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figured it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve figured it out by now .
"The reason the problem has gotten worse , rather than better , is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s accelerating .
The universe is not only expanding .
"If you look at the galaxy , it &apos;s moving away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away faster ."
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating .
"Unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that empty space itself has energy .
"In every little cubic centimeter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , according to Einstein , exerts a push on the universe ."
It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other .
"Because dark energy , unlike matter or radiation , does not dilute away as the universe expands ."
"The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger ."
This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will expand forever ."
"Back when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future .
Einstein was fond of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever ."
"14 billion years in the past , 100 billion dog years , but an infinite number of years into the future ."
"Meanwhile , for all intents and purposes , space looks finite to us ."
"Space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is accelerating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon ."
"So even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us ."
"Finally , empty space has a temperature ."
"In the 1970s , Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics ."
"The curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation , and the black hole radiates ."
"A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space , then the whole universe radiates ."
The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations .
"And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever .
Well what is the implication of that ?
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century .
"He said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a probabilistic statement .
"It will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to worry about — the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us .
"It &apos;s very , very unlikely ."
"Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever , that would happen ."
"Everything that is allowed , every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room , would eventually be obtained ."
"So Boltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium ."
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the expansion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton — they were absolute ; they just stuck there forever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere — the everything molecules .
"But if you &apos;re Boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctuations into lower entropy , more organized situations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas — the multiverse and the anthropic principle ."
"He says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"Remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , metabolize , walk and talk , if we lived in thermal equilibrium ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an infinitely big universe , with randomly bumping into each other particles , there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states , and then they relax back ."
But there will also be large fluctuations .
"Occasionally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So Boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the region where entropy is low .
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means ."
"Carl Sagan once famously said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In Boltzmann &apos;s scenario , if you want to make an apple pie , you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie ."
"That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie ."
So this scenario makes predictions .
And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal .
"Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our memories , but our impression that outside there &apos;s something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy , it &apos;s much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech , the United States and the galaxy ."
"The good news is that , therefore , this scenario does not work ; it is not right ."
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation .
"Even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And Feynman also understood this .
"Feynman says , &quot; &quot; From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation , all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mixed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were due to a fluctuation , we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it ."
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fluctuation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m running out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists ."
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s cooling off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy remains around , the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel , they will stop burning ."
They will fall into black holes .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has lived .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black holes don &apos;t last forever .
"They will evaporate , and we will be left with nothing but empty space ."
That empty space lasts essentially forever .
"However , you notice , since empty space gives off radiation , there &apos;s actually thermal fluctuations , and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space ."
"So even though the universe lasts forever , there &apos;s only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"Number one : If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the warm , comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang ?"
Why aren &apos;t we in empty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be living , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
Why aren &apos;t you ?
More homework assignment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my favorite scenario .
Either it &apos;s just like that . There is no explanation .
This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
"An egg , an unbroken egg , is a low entropy configuration , and yet , when we open our refrigerator , we do not go , &quot; &quot; Hah , how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken ."
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
"Maybe there is something that naturally , through the growth of the laws of physics , gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse ."
That &apos;s my favorite scenario .
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations ."
This is a prediction . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday .
Thank you .

Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .
And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
"So this is it . And for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted — 27 kilometers in circumference ."
"Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second ."
It &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
This is the machine below Geneva .
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors .
"This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the ATLAS detector — 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter ."
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale .
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It caused immense celebration in the control room .
"It &apos;s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately , and showering particles into the detector ."
"In other words , when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph ."
"I don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that ."
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
"About a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here — these gold wires ."
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
"Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wires . &quot;"
They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire .
"So at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current ."
"In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect ."
"So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance ."
This was the result .
"Now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot ."
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
"We had to take them out , which we did ."
"We reconditioned them all , fixed them ."
They &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again .
"We will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are ."
"Now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . It &apos;s easy to refute ."
"I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re overreaching , is the value of things like the LHC ."
"I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments — his protege was Michael Faraday — said this , &quot; &quot; Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
"I work with a bunch of mathematicians , philosophers and computer scientists , and we sit around and think about the future of machine intelligence , among other things ."
"Some people think that some of these things are sort of science fiction-y , far out there , crazy ."
"But I like to say , okay , let &apos;s look at the modern human condition ."
( Laughter ) This is the normal way for things to be .
"But if we think about it , we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet , the human species ."
"Think about if Earth was created one year ago , the human species , then , would be 10 minutes old ."
The industrial era started two seconds ago .
"Another way to look at this is to think of world GDP over the last 10,000 years , I &apos;ve actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph ."
It looks like this .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a curious shape for a normal condition .
I sure wouldn &apos;t want to sit on it .
Some people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has accumulated through human history , and right now , technology advances extremely rapidly — that is the proximate cause , that &apos;s why we are currently so very productive ."
But I like to think back further to the ultimate cause .
"Look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen : We have Kanzi — he &apos;s mastered 200 lexical tokens , an incredible feat ."
And Ed Witten unleashed the second superstring revolution .
"If we look under the hood , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little larger , it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it &apos;s wired ."
"These invisible differences cannot be too complicated , however , because there have only been 250,000 generations since our last common ancestor ."
We know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve .
"So a bunch of relatively minor changes take us from Kanzi to Witten , from broken-off tree branches to intercontinental ballistic missiles ."
"So this then seems pretty obvious that everything we &apos;ve achieved , and everything we care about , depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind ."
"And the corollary , of course , is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences ."
"Some of my colleagues think we &apos;re on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate , and that is machine superintelligence ."
Artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box .
You would have human programmers that would painstakingly handcraft knowledge items .
"You build up these expert systems , and they were kind of useful for some purposes , but they were very brittle , you couldn &apos;t scale them ."
"But since then , a paradigm shift has taken place in the field of artificial intelligence ."
"Today , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features , we create algorithms that learn , often from raw perceptual data ."
Basically the same thing that the human infant does .
"The result is A.I. that is not limited to one domain — the same system can learn to translate between any pairs of languages , or learn to play any computer game on the Atari console ."
"Now of course , A.I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful , cross-domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has ."
"So the question is , how far are we from being able to match those tricks ?"
"And the median answer was 2040 or 2050 , depending on precisely which group of experts we asked ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or sooner , the truth is nobody really knows ."
What we do know is that the ultimate limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside the limits in biological tissue .
This comes down to physics .
"A biological neuron fires , maybe , at 200 hertz , 200 times a second ."
But even a present-day transistor operates at the Gigahertz .
"Neurons propagate slowly in axons , 100 meters per second , tops ."
"But in computers , signals can travel at the speed of light ."
"There are also size limitations , like a human brain has to fit inside a cranium , but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger ."
"So the potential for superintelligence lies dormant in matter , much like the power of the atom lay dormant throughout human history , patiently waiting there until 1945 ."
"In this century , scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence explosion .
"Now most people , when they think about what is smart and what is dumb , I think have in mind a picture roughly like this ."
"So at one end we have the village idiot , and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten , or Albert Einstein , or whoever your favorite guru is ."
"But I think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence , the true picture is actually probably more like this : AI starts out at this point here , at zero intelligence , and then , after many , many years of really hard work , maybe eventually we get to mouse-level artificial intelligence , something that can navigate cluttered environments as well as a mouse can ."
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of investment , maybe eventually we get to chimpanzee-level artificial intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village idiot artificial intelligence ."
"And a few moments later , we are beyond Ed Witten ."
The train doesn &apos;t stop at Humanville Station .
"It &apos;s likely , rather , to swoosh right by ."
"Now this has profound implications , particularly when it comes to questions of power ."
"For example , chimpanzees are strong — pound for pound , a chimpanzee is about twice as strong as a fit human male ."
"And yet , the fate of Kanzi and his pals depends a lot more on what we humans do than on what the chimpanzees do themselves ."
"Once there is superintelligence , the fate of humanity may depend on what the superintelligence does ."
Think about it : Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make .
"Machines will then be better at inventing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on digital timescales ."
What this means is basically a telescoping of the future .
"Think of all the crazy technologies that you could have imagined maybe humans could have developed in the fullness of time : cures for aging , space colonization , self-replicating nanobots or uploading of minds into computers , all kinds of science fiction-y stuff that &apos;s nevertheless consistent with the laws of physics ."
"All of this superintelligence could develop , and possibly quite rapidly ."
"Now , a superintelligence with such technological maturity would be extremely powerful , and at least in some scenarios , it would be able to get what it wants ."
We would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this A.I.
"Now a good question is , what are those preferences ?"
Here it gets trickier .
"To make any headway with this , we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing ."
"And this is ironic because every newspaper article about the future of A.I. has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to conceive of the issue more abstractly , not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an optimization process , a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations ."
A superintelligence is a really strong optimization process .
It &apos;s extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized .
"This means that there is no necessary connection between being highly intelligent in this sense , and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful ."
Suppose we give an A.I. the goal to make humans smile .
"When the A.I. becomes superintelligent , it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal : take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant , beaming grins ."
"Another example , suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem ."
"When the A.I. becomes superintelligent , it realizes that the most effective way to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet into a giant computer , so as to increase its thinking capacity ."
"Of course , perceivably things won &apos;t go wrong in these particular ways ; these are cartoon examples ."
This is a lesson that &apos;s also taught in many a myth .
King Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold .
"He touches his daughter , she turns into gold ."
"He touches his food , it turns into gold ."
"Now you might say , if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people &apos;s faces , we &apos;d just shut it off ."
"A , this is not necessarily so easy to do if we &apos;ve grown dependent on the system — like , where is the off switch to the Internet ?"
"B , why haven &apos;t the chimpanzees flicked the off switch to humanity , or the Neanderthals ?"
They certainly had reasons .
"We have an off switch , for example , right here ."
"The point is , we should not be confident that we have this under control here ."
"So we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap , but again , like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering ."
"More creative scenarios are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A.I. , you can imagine wiggling electrodes around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you can use to communicate ."
"Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction , and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you , they look at the source code — Bam ! — the manipulation can take place ."
"Sooner or later , it will out ."
"I believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent A.I. such that even if — when — it escapes , it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved ."
"Instead , we would create an A.I. that uses its intelligence to learn what we value , and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of ."
We would thus leverage its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value-loading .
"This can happen , and the outcome could be very good for humanity ."
But it doesn &apos;t happen automatically .
The initial conditions for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation .
"And there are also some esoteric issues that would need to be solved , sorted out : the exact details of its decision theory , how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth ."
"So the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult — not as difficult as making a superintelligent A.I. , but fairly difficult ."
Here is the worry : Making superintelligent A.I. is a really hard challenge .
Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that .
"So I think that we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance , so that we have it available by the time it is needed ."
"But the more of the control problem that we solve in advance , the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if things turn out okay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right ."
( Applause )
"Not yours , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and write something more fun .
And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook .
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I cover the rest of the cube , you can see that they are identical ."
Vision is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some cognitive illusions , or decision-making illusions , in the same way ."
"Germany is on the left , and Austria is on the right ."
"The Netherlands is on the left , and Belgium is on the right ."
"People don &apos;t check , and they don &apos;t join ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"All these medications , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
"Now , weekend in Paris , weekend in Rome — these are different things ."
"If you want coffee , you have to pay for it yourself , it &apos;s two euros 50 ."
This is why we have these four-minute dates .
"I &apos;ll show you images here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I showed some people a picture of Tom , and a picture of Jerry ."
"and I said , &quot; &quot; Who do you want to date ?"
"And the question was , will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How noble in reason ! &quot;
"Are we Superman , or are we Homer Simpson ?"

"1.3 billion years ago , in a distant , distant galaxy , two black holes locked into a spiral , falling inexorably towards each other and collided , converting three Suns &apos; worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second ."
"For that brief moment in time , the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe ."
It was a very big bang .
But they didn &apos;t release their energy in light .
"I mean , you know , they &apos;re black holes ."
"All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself , making the Universe explode in gravitational waves ."
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here .
"1.3 billion years ago , Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life ."
"Since then , Earth has made and evolved corals , fish , plants , dinosaurs , people and even — God save us — the Internet ."
"Now , most people thought they were nuts ."
But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea .
It &apos;s now called Advanced LIGO as a result .
"In early September of 2015 , LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details ."
"And on September 14 of 2015 , just days after the detector had gone live , the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth ."
And they passed through you and me .
And they passed through the detector .
( Audio ) Scott Hughes : There &apos;s two moments in my life more emotionally intense than that .
"You know , it was the payoff of my career , basically ."
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave .
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time .
"As the wave passes by , it stretches space and everything in it in one direction , and compresses it in the other ."
This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity .
"&quot; It stretches and expands , it stretches and expands . &quot;"
So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they &apos;re very weak ; they &apos;re preposterously weak .
"For example , the waves that hit us on September 14 — and yes , every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave — when the waves hit , they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21 ."
"That &apos;s a decimal place , 20 zeroes , and a one ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts .
Even with a laser detector five kilometers long — and that &apos;s already crazy — they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom .
And that &apos;s preposterous .
"So towards the end of his classic text on gravity , LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows : He said , &quot; &quot; The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous ."
"But physicists are ingenious , and with the support of a broad lay public , all obstacles will surely be overcome . &quot; &quot; Thorne published that in 1973 , 42 years before he succeeded ."
"Now , coming back to LIGO , Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye ."
I want to explain what that means .
"Visible light has a wavelength , a size , that &apos;s much smaller than the things around you , the features on people &apos;s faces , the size of your cell phone ."
"And that &apos;s really useful , because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you , by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you ."
Sound is different .
Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long .
"And that makes it really difficult — in fact , in practical purposes , impossible — to make an image of something you really care about ."
Your child &apos;s face .
"Instead , we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds ."
That &apos;s Alice talking .
That &apos;s Bob interrupting .
Silly Bob .
"So , the same is true of gravitational waves ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe .
"But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves , we can hear the story that those waves are telling ."
"And at least for LIGO , the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band ."
"So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air , into sound , we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us ."
"For example , listening to gravity , just in this way , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about ."
"( Audio ) SH : If the two black holes are non-spinning , you get a very simple chirp : whoop !"
"If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly , I have that same chirp , but with a modulation on top of it , so it kind of goes : whir , whir , whir !"
It &apos;s sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform .
AA : It &apos;s worth pausing here to think about what that means .
"Two black holes , the densest thing in the Universe , one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns , whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide ."
It &apos;s fantastic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the lasting importance of LIGO .
It &apos;s an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we &apos;ve never had before .
It &apos;s a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible .
And there &apos;s a lot out there that we can &apos;t see — in practice or even in principle .
"So supernova , for example : I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae ."
"We &apos;ll never see through it , it &apos;s opaque to light ."
"With gravitational waves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"Perhaps most importantly , I &apos;m positive that there are things out there that we &apos;ve never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven &apos;t even imagined — things that we &apos;ll only discover by listening ."
"And in fact , even in that very first event , LIGO found things that we didn &apos;t expect ."
"They &apos;re these massive things that are old , from prehistoric times , and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology ."
AA : Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible .
"Our job is to dream up and build new observatories — a whole new generation of observatories — on the ground , in space ."
"I mean , what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself ?"
Our job now is to dream big .
Dream with us .
Thank you .

"Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling , but whose streets we can &apos;t walk ."
"By studying those twinkling lights though , we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life ."
"In this image of the Tokyo skyline , I &apos;ve hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block , the Kepler Mission ."
Can you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at , where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
"In just over two years of operations , we &apos;ve found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars ."
"To give you some perspective , in the previous two decades of searching , we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler ."
"When we see these little dips in the light , we can determine a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can determine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star ."
That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall .
"And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I sitting around a campfire : You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you &apos;re warm , but not so close that you &apos;re too toasty and you get burned ."
"However , there &apos;s more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s shown here in visible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human eyes .
You &apos;ll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball — that Sun that we all draw when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll notice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has freckles ."
"These freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to vary .
"And we can measure this very , very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects ."
"However , these are just the tip of the iceberg ."
"If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes , we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun &apos;s magnetic activity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"Just think , even when it &apos;s cloudy outside , these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather — this high-energy radiation , the UV and the X-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system ."
"I &apos;m showing here Venus , Earth and Mars — three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
Kepler won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every measurement it makes is precious , because it &apos;s teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe ."
"While it &apos;s Kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it &apos;s we , life , who are searching ."
Thank you .

"A human child is born , and for quite a long time is a consumer ."
It cannot be consciously a contributor .
It is helpless .
"It doesn &apos;t know how to survive , even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive ."
"It needs the help of mother , or a foster mother , to survive ."
It can &apos;t afford to doubt the person who tends the child .
"It has to totally surrender , as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist ."
It has to totally surrender .
That implies a lot of trust .
That implies the trusted person won &apos;t violate the trust .
"As the child grows , it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust ."
"It doesn &apos;t know even the word &quot; &quot; violation . &quot; &quot; Therefore , it has to blame itself , a wordless blame , which is more difficult to really resolve — the wordless self-blame ."
"As the child grows to become an adult : so far , it has been a consumer , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute , to be a contributor ."
"One cannot contribute unless one feels secure , one feels big , one feels : I have enough ."
To be compassionate is not a joke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself .
"That bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself ."
The self : you are self-aware .
"On that self , it should be centered — a bigness , a wholeness ."
"Otherwise , compassion is just a word and a dream ."
"You can be compassionate occasionally , more moved by empathy than by compassion ."
Thank God we are empathetic .
"When somebody &apos;s in pain , we pick up the pain ."
"In a Wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out ."
Each one has got two games .
It can be anybody &apos;s game .
What they have sweated so far has no meaning .
One person wins .
"The tennis etiquette is , both the players have to come to the net and shake hands ."
"The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it ."
( Laughter ) And this guy has to come to the net .
"When he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes ."
It looks as though he &apos;s wishing that he didn &apos;t win .
Why ? Empathy .
That &apos;s human heart .
No human heart is denied of that empathy .
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
"No culture , no nation and nationalism — nothing can touch it because it is empathy ."
"And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
Compassion is not defined in one form .
There &apos;s no Indian compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
"It transcends nation , the gender , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experienced by people occasionally .
"Then this occasional compassion , we are not talking about — it will never remain occasional ."
"By mandate , you cannot make a person compassionate ."
"You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Please love me . &quot; &quot; Love is something you discover ."
"It &apos;s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
"I am going to cite the possibility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In spite of a very tragic life , one is happy in moments which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a slapstick joke , accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and unknown things ."
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself .
"The subject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the object — the scheme of things — fuse into oneness , an experience nobody can say , &quot; &quot; I am denied of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and sundry ."
"That experience confirms that , in spite of all your limitations — all your wants , desires , unfulfilled , and the credit cards and layoffs and , finally , baldness — you can be happy ."
But the extension of the logic is that you don &apos;t need to fulfill your desire to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wholeness that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no choice in this : that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you , cannot be minus you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
"Your moment of happiness reveals that reality , that realization , that recognition : &quot; &quot; Maybe I am the whole ."
Maybe the swami is right .
Maybe the swami is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Then everything becomes meaningful .
I have no more reason to blame myself .
"If one has to blame oneself , one has a million reasons plus many ."
"But if I say , in spite of my body being limited — if it is black it is not white , if it is white it is not black : body is limited any which way you look at it . Limited ."
"Your knowledge is limited , health is limited , and power is therefore limited , and the cheerfulness is going to be limited ."
Compassion is going to be limited .
Everything is going to be limitless .
"You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless , and nobody can become limitless , either you are or you are not . Period ."
And there is no way of your being not limitless too .
"Your own experience reveals , in spite of all limitations , you are the whole ."
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world .
It is love first .
"When you relate to the world , the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is , what we say , love ."
And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion .
"Then that again transforms into giving , into sharing ."
You express yourself because you have compassion .
"To discover compassion , you need to be compassionate ."
"To discover the capacity to give and share , you need to be giving and sharing ."
There is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming .
You learn swimming by swimming .
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn swimming by swimming . You learn cycling by cycling .
"You learn cooking by cooking , having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook ."
"( Laughter ) And , therefore , what I say , you have to fake it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
My predecessor meant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act compassionately .
"There is no verb for compassion , but you have an adverb for compassion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act compassionately .
"But then , how to act compassionately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?"
That is where you fake .
You fake it and make it . This is the mantra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You fake it and make it .
"You act compassionately as though you have compassion : grind your teeth , take all the support system ."
"If you know how to pray , pray ."
Ask for compassion .
Let me act compassionately .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion , and slowly , perhaps if you get the right teaching , you &apos;ll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself , which is oneness , wholeness , and that &apos;s what you are ."
"With these words , thank you very much ."

How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on landmass .
And here &apos;s how news shapes what Americans see .
"This map — ( Applause ) — this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in February of 2007 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities ."
There was massive flooding in Indonesia .
"And in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man &apos;s impact on global warming ."
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
"And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of Iraq — that &apos;s that big green thing there — and little else ."
"The combined coverage of Russia , China and India , for example , reached just one percent ."
"When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The death of Anna Nicole Smith .
"This story eclipsed every country except Iraq , and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report ."
"And the cycle continues ; as we all know , Britney has loomed pretty large lately ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half .
"Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi , New Delhi and Mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa , India or South America — places that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news .
"Local TV news looms large , and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news ."
And what about the web ?
The most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
"Last year , Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News &apos; front page ."
"And they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events ."
"Similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters , and don &apos;t put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college graduates , as well as less educated Americans , know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong ."
"In recent years , Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we afford not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback .
"And it &apos;s , again , linked to something nice ."
And that makes failure seem much more crushing .
"That &apos;s exhilarating if you &apos;re doing well , and very crushing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy ."
"There are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dropping on people &apos;s heads , illnesses , etc ."
"That is an unknown part of them , and we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known ."
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
"( Applause ) In a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper ."
"The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety , is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human ."
"It &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
"When we &apos;re told that banking is a very respectable profession , a lot of us want to go into banking ."
"When banking is no longer so respectable , we lose interest in banking ."
"But what I really want to stress is : by all means , success , yes ."
But let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture — The X prize , the X-Files , Project X , TEDx ."
Where &apos;d that come from ?
"About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language ."
"To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation , because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks .
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
And al-jebr roughly translates to &quot; the system for reconciling disparate parts . &quot;
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe — which is to say Spain — in the 11th and 12th centuries .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don &apos;t make it through a European voice box without lots of practice .
Trust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
"This is the letter SHeen , and it makes the sound we think of as SH — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some undefined , unknown thing ."
"Now in Arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al-shalan — the unknown thing ."
"And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century derivation of proofs ."
"The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can &apos;t be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn &apos;t have that SH , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai ."
"Later when this material was translated into a common European language , which is to say Latin , they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X."
"And once that happened , once this material was in Latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ? X is the unknown
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in Spanish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was worth sharing .
( Applause )
So it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
"Then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens ."
How many times have you used the word &quot; &quot; awesome &quot; &quot; today ?
Once ? Twice ? Seventeen times ?
Do you remember what you were describing when you used the word ?
"Now , with that in mind , was your Quiznos sandwich awesome ?"
How about that parking space ? Was that awesome ?
Or that game the other day ? Was that awesome ?
"The answer is no , no and no ."
"A sandwich can be delicious , that parking space can be nearby , and that game can be a blowout , but not everything can be awesome ."
"There &apos;s no dynamic , there &apos;s no highs or lows , if everything is awesome ."
"Ladies and gentlemen , here are 10 things that are truly awesome ."
"Yes , so I think I &apos;ll invent the wheel ."
"The wheel , ladies and gentlemen ."
Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone .
Were the Great Pyramids awesome ?
"Yes , the pyramids were awesome ."
The Grand Canyon . Come on .
It &apos;s almost 80 million years old .
Is the Grand Canyon awesome ?
"Yes , the Grand Canyon is ."
"I mean , come on . Is photography awesome ?"
"D-Day , June 6 , 1944 , the Allied invasion of Normandy , the largest amphibious invasion in world history ."
"Was D-Day awesome ? Yes , it was awesome ."
Did you eat food today ? Did you eat ?
"Then you can thank the honeybee , that &apos;s the one , because if crops aren &apos;t pollinated , we can &apos;t grow food , and then we &apos;re all going to die ."
It &apos;s just like that .
"But it &apos;s not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower , although that would be awesome ."
( Laughter ) Bees are awesome . Are you kidding me ?
Landing on the moon ! Come on !
Apollo 11 . Are you kidding me ?
That &apos;s like from here to the moon .
"You &apos;re damn right , it was ."
"Woodstock , 1969 : Rolling Stone Magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll ."
Tickets were only 24 dollars back then .
You can &apos;t even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now .
"Was Woodstock awesome ? Yes , it was awesome ."
"Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime ."
Does awesome inspire fear ?
"Oh , hell yeah , sharks are awesome !"
"The Internet was born in 1982 and it instantly took over global communication , and later tonight , when all these PowerPoints are uplifted to the Internet so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk and watch this crap , the Internet is awesome ."
I will save you the time .
"I &apos;m Dr. David Hanson , and I build robots with character ."
"And by that , I mean that I develop robots that are characters , but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you ."
"So we &apos;re starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces , make eye contact with you , make a full range of facial expressions , understand speech and begin to model how you &apos;re feeling and who you are , and build a relationship with you ."
"I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved , on lower power , which enabled the walking biped robots , the first androids ."
"So , it &apos;s a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face , running on very small batteries , extremely lightweight ."
"The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber , and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen ."
"One is hierarchical pores , and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material ."
There he &apos;s starting to walk .
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology .
I built the head . They built the body .
"So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines , and not just sentience , but empathy ."
We &apos;re working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego .
"They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions , what facial expressions you &apos;re making ."
"It also recognizes where you &apos;re looking , your head orientation ."
"We &apos;re emulating all the major facial expressions , and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine ."
And here is a little bit of the technology that &apos;s involved in that .
"In fact , right now — plug it from here , and then plug it in here , and now let &apos;s see if it gets my facial expressions ."
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
( Laughter ) Now I &apos;m frowning .
And this is really heavily backlit .
"Okay , here we go ."
"Oh , it &apos;s so sad ."
"Okay , so you smile , frowning ."
So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic .
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing . Right ?
Those machines have no place for empathy .
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy .
"So , if they achieve human level intelligence or , quite possibly , greater than human levels of intelligence , this could be the seeds of hope for our future ."
"So , we &apos;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years , during the course of getting my Ph.D."
"And then I started Hanson Robotics , which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing ."
This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago .
"And it sees multiple people in a scene , remembers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remembering people ."
"So , we &apos;re involving two things ."
"One , the perception of people , and two , the natural interface , the natural form of the interface , so that it &apos;s more intuitive for you to interact with the robot ."
You start to believe that it &apos;s alive and aware .
"So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick , who wrote great works like , &quot; &quot; Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? &quot; &quot; which was the basis of the movie &quot; &quot; Bladerunner . &quot; &quot; In these stories , robots often think that they &apos;re human , and they sort of come to life ."
"So we put his writings , letters , his interviews , correspondences , into a huge database of thousands of pages , and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him ."
"And it was kind of spooky , because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you ."
"And this is one of the most exciting projects that we &apos;re developing , which is a little character that &apos;s a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence , friendly machine intelligence ."
And we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
"We specked it out to actually be doable with a very , very low-cost bill of materials , so that it can become a childhood companion for kids ."
"Interfacing with the Internet , it gets smarter over the years ."
"As artificial intelligence evolves , so does his intelligence ."
Chris Anderson : Thank you so much . That &apos;s incredible .

There is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
"The questions I would like to talk about are : one , where did we come from ?"
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
"Up until the 1920s , everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time ."
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding .
Distant galaxies were moving away from us .
This meant they must have been closer together in the past .
"If we extrapolate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago ."
"This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe ."
But was there anything before the Big Bang ?
"If not , what created the universe ?"
Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did ?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts .
"First , there were the laws like Maxwell &apos;s equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe , given its state over all of space at one time ."
"And second , there was no question of the initial state of the universe ."
"We have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions ."
"But until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe ."
"However , this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct ."
"Under extreme conditions , general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space ."
"This removes the distinction between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state ."
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing .
"Moreover , we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states ."
"These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background , which is an imprint of the very early universe ."
We think we have solved the mystery of creation .
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence .
"I now turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?"
"We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth , so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets , of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy ."
But we don &apos;t know how life first appeared .
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing .
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago .
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years .
"So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible , which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type ."
This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high .
"If it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available ."
"On the other hand , we don &apos;t seem to have been visited by aliens ."
I am discounting the reports of UFOs .
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos ?
"If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring , it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far ."
"Furthermore , despite an extensive search by the SETI project , we haven &apos;t heard any alien television quiz shows ."
This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years .
This brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race .
"If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy , we should make sure we survive and continue ."
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past .
"Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth , but to spread out into space ."
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
"But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years , our future is in space ."
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions .
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap .
"Indeed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge ."
"The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe , and we are making good progress ."
Thank you for listening .
"Chris Anderson : Professor , if you had to guess either way , do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way , as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher ?"
"This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED ."
Stephen Hawking : I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years ; otherwise we would have heard radio waves .
"The alternative is that civilizations don &apos;t last very long , but destroy themselves ."
"CA : Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer ."
"We will take it as a salutary warning , I think , for the rest of our conference this week ."
"Professor , we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today ."
Thank you very much indeed .

Here &apos;s a question we need to rethink together : What should be the role of money and markets in our societies ?
"Today , there are very few things that money can &apos;t buy ."
"If you &apos;re sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara , California , you should know that if you don &apos;t like the standard accommodations , you can buy a prison cell upgrade ."
"It &apos;s true . For how much , do you think ?"
What would you guess ?
Five hundred dollars ?
It &apos;s not the Ritz-Carlton . It &apos;s a jail !
Eighty-two dollars a night . Eighty-two dollars a night .
If you go to an amusement park
"and don &apos;t want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides , there is now a solution ."
"In many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line ."
They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets .
And this isn &apos;t only happening in amusement parks .
"In Washington , D.C. , long lines , queues sometimes form for important Congressional hearings ."
"Now some people don &apos;t like to wait in long queues , maybe overnight , even in the rain ."
"So now , for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don &apos;t like to wait , there are companies , line-standing companies , and you can go to them ."
"You can pay them a certain amount of money , they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes , and the lobbyist , just before the hearing begins , can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room ."
Paid line standing .
"It &apos;s happening , the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions , in bigger arenas ."
Take the way we fight our wars .
"Did you know that , in Iraq and Afghanistan , there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were U.S. military troops ?"
"Now this isn &apos;t because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies , but this is what has happened ."
"Over the past three decades , we have lived through a quiet revolution ."
We &apos;ve drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies .
"The difference is this : A market economy is a tool , a valuable and effective tool , for organizing productive activity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale ."
"It &apos;s a way of life , in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life : personal relations , family life , health , education , politics , law , civic life ."
"Now , why worry ? Why worry about our becoming market societies ?"
"For two reasons , I think ."
One of them has to do with inequality .
"The more things money can buy , the more affluence , or the lack of it , matters ."
"If the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs , then inequality wouldn &apos;t matter very much ."
"But when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life — decent health care , access to the best education , political voice and influence in campaigns — when money comes to govern all of those things , inequality matters a great deal ."
And so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence .
That &apos;s one reason to worry .
"There &apos;s a second reason apart from the worry about inequality , and it &apos;s this : with some social goods and practices , when market thinking and market values enter , they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about ."
"I &apos;d like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism , a cash incentive , and see what you think about it ."
"Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids , especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds , to study hard , to do well in school , to apply themselves ."
Some economists have proposed a market solution : Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books .
"They &apos;ve tried this , actually ."
They &apos;ve done some experiments in some major American cities .
"In New York , in Chicago , in Washington , D.C. , they &apos;ve tried this , offering 50 dollars for an A , 35 dollars for a B."
"In Dallas , Texas , they have a program that offers eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read ."
"So let &apos;s see what — Some people are in favor , some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement ."
Let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
"Imagine that you are the head of a major school system , and someone comes to you with this proposal ."
And let &apos;s say it &apos;s a foundation . They will provide the funds .
You don &apos;t have to take it out of your budget .
How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try ?
Let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
"First , how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work ? Raise your hand ."
"And how many would be opposed ? How many would — So the majority here are opposed , but a sizable minority are in favor ."
Let &apos;s have a discussion .
"Let &apos;s start with those of you who object , who would rule it out even before trying ."
What would be your reason ?
Who will get our discussion started ? Yes ?
"Heike Moses : Hello everyone , I &apos;m Heike , and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation , so in the respect that children , if they would like to read , you just take this incentive away in just paying them , so it just changes behavior ."
Michael Sandel : Takes the intrinsic incentive away .
"What is , or should be , the intrinsic motivation ?"
"HM : Well , the intrinsic motivation should be to learn ."
MS : To learn . HM : To get to know the world .
"And then , if you stop paying them , what happens then ?"
Then they stop reading ?
"MS : Now , let &apos;s see if there &apos;s someone who favors , who thinks it &apos;s worth trying this ."
"Elizabeth Loftus : I &apos;m Elizabeth Loftus , and you said worth a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?"
MS : And measure . And what would you measure ?
You &apos;d measure how many — EL : How many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them .
"MS : Oh , after you stopped paying ."
"All right , what about that ?"
"HM : To be frank , I just think this is , not to offend anyone , a very American way ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) MS : All right . What &apos;s emerged from this discussion is the following question : Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation , the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey , which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes ?"
"And people disagree about what the effect will be , but that seems to be the question , that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson , and if it does , what will become of these children later ?"
I should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experiments .
"The cash for good grades has had very mixed results , for the most part has not resulted in higher grades ."
The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books .
It also led them to read shorter books .
"( Laughter ) But the real question is , what will become of these kids later ?"
"Will they have learned that reading is a chore , a form of piecework to be done for pay , that &apos;s the worry , or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake ?"
"Now , what this , even this brief debate , brings out is something that many economists overlook ."
"Economists often assume that markets are inert , that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange ."
"Market exchange , they assume , doesn &apos;t change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged ."
"If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift , it will be the same good ."
It will work the same either way .
But the same may not be true if we &apos;re talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life .
"In those domains , bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about ."
"Once we see that markets and commerce , when extended beyond the material domain , can change the character of the goods themselves , can change the meaning of the social practices , as in the example of teaching and learning , we have to ask where markets belong and where they don &apos;t , where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about ."
"But to have this debate , we have to do something we &apos;re not very good at , and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize , from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning to civic life ."
"Now these are controversial questions , and so we tend to shrink from them ."
"In fact , during the past three decades , when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige , our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out , empty of larger moral meaning ."
"For fear of disagreement , we shrink from these questions ."
"But once we see that markets change the character of goods , we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods ."
"One of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality , the sense that we are all in it together ."
"Against the background of rising inequality , marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives ."
We live and work and shop and play in different places .
Our children go to different schools .
"This isn &apos;t good for democracy , nor is it a satisfying way to live , even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line ."
Here &apos;s why .
"Democracy does not require perfect equality , but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life ."
And this is how we come to care for the common good .
"And so , in the end , the question of markets is not mainly an economic question ."
It &apos;s really a question of how we want to live together .
"Do we want a society where everything is up for sale , or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy ?"
Thank you very much .

Some of those reforms have been good .
And we know why kids drop out .
We know why kids don &apos;t learn .
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
I have looked at the best and I &apos;ve looked at some of the worst .
"Needless to say , it was ."
You ever thought about that ?
"I am powerful , and I am strong ."
I deserve the education that I get here .
"&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; I ain &apos;t all bad . &quot;"
Can we stand to have more relationships ?
Never .
It &apos;s the connection . It &apos;s the relationships .
"We teach anyway , because that &apos;s what we do ."
Teaching and learning should bring joy .
We &apos;re born to make a difference .
Thank you so much .

Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
"I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim-majority societies ."
"So let me begin by first of all giving a very , very brief history of time , if I may indulge ."
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances .
An identity was defined primarily by religion .
"In the age of globalization , we moved on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re moving into a new age , and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as &quot; &quot; the age of behavior . &quot; &quot; How I define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances , where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives ."
"But actually it &apos;s my belief that the people who &apos;ve been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until recent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances , using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies , those who &apos;ve been benefiting from this have been extremists ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to elaborate on .
"Now I should know , because for 13 years of my life , I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization ."
"And my story , my personal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I &apos;m attempting to elaborate upon here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an Essex lad , born and raised in Essex in the U.K."
"At the age of 17 , I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization ."
"Now that journey , and what took me from Essex all the way across the world — by the way , we were laughing at democratic activists ."
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear .
I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used .
"Eventually I was detected , of course , in Egypt ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation-state .
"So as I said , we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it ."
And it &apos;s not just Islamist extremists that did this .
A form of anti-Islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it &apos;s transnational .
And the consequences that this is having is that it &apos;s affecting the political climate across Europe .
Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world .
"In certain countries , mosque minarets are being banned ."
"In others , kosher and halal meat are being banned , as we speak ."
"And on the flip side , we have transnational Islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have felt isolated , until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far behind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot : there &apos;s a man called Anwar al-Awlaki .
"As an American citizen , ethnically a Yemeni , in hiding currently in Yemen , who inspired a Nigerian , son of the head of Nigeria &apos;s national bank ."
"This Nigerian student studied in London , trained in Yemen , boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America ."
"The Old mentality with a capital O , as represented by the nation-state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recognizing the power of transnational social movements , got left behind ."
And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the United States of America .
"Again with the example of the far right : that we find , ironically , xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization ."
So why are they succeeding ?
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this .
"And a social movement is comprised , in my view , it &apos;s comprised of four main characteristics ."
It &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aware of , and that &apos;s the example of Al-Qaeda ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind immediately ."
"Incidentally , the difference between ideas and narratives : the idea is the cause that one believes in ; and the narrative is the way to sell that cause — the propaganda , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately .
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently .
And that &apos;s the power of social movements .
"However , if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan , and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today , you &apos;ll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto ."
"Which means , by definition , that particular leader no longer exists ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re facing is , in my view , that there are no globalized , youth-led , grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across Muslim-majority societies ."
"There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda , without the terrorism , for democracy across Muslim-majority societies ."
So that begs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reasons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s complacency ."
And that level of complacency means they don &apos;t feel the need to advocate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political correctness ."
That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that — we associate believing in the universality of our values — with extremists .
"Yet actually , whenever we talk about human rights , we do say that human rights are universal ."
But actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with Islamist extremism .
To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we &apos;ve arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .
"And then you have a third party saying , &quot; Vote for us ; we &apos;ll establish a theocracy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a result of this is , when those parties are elected , and inevitably they fail , or inevitably they make political mistakes , democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried democracy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reasons , let &apos;s break down certain preconceptions ."
"Anecdotally , we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor , well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia ."
"His deputy , Ayman al-Zawahiri , was a pediatrician — not an ill-educated man ."
"And what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground , in addition to international aid , in addition to education , in addition to health ."
"Not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside-down .
Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down .
"Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations , for decades , have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots ."
"Mass movements in Pakistan have been represented after the Arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy , rather than for a democratic uprising ."
"Because since pre-partition , they &apos;ve been building demand for their ideology on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture — which is necessarily more than just elections .
"What that will do is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier , where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here — the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy , not for a democracy ."
"Now to conclude , how does that happen ?"
"Well , Egypt is a good starting point ."
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt was particularly cathartic for me .
We need to move one step beyond that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi , where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and thank you for your time ."
"Back in New York , I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood ."
"When I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company ."
"Now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remember my first fire .
"I was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
"When I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life ."
"Here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , barefoot , while her house was in flames ."
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let &apos;s call him Lex Luther — ( Laughter ) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
The dog ! I was stunned with jealousy .
"Here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The captain waved me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house ."
"I need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I swear ."
"So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went — up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero ."
( Laughter ) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door .
"We took our treasures outside to the homeowner , where , not surprisingly , his received much more attention than did mine ."
"A few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home ."
The act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
"( Laughter ) In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait ."
Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
Serve food at a soup kitchen . Clean up a neighborhood park .
Be a mentor .
"Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one ."
So get in the game . Save the shoes .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , come back . ( Applause )"
Mark Bezos : Thank you .
"Good morning everyone . First of all , it &apos;s been fantastic being here over these past few days ."
"And secondly , I feel it &apos;s a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people , these amazing talks that we &apos;ve had ."
"I feel that I &apos;ve fitted in , in many ways , to some of the things that I &apos;ve heard ."
"I came directly here from the deep , deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador , where I was out — you could only get there by a plane — with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses , where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies , and keep the roads , out of their forests ."
"They &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t contaminated , a world that isn &apos;t polluted ."
"And what was so amazing to me , and what fits right in with what we &apos;re all talking about here at TED , is that there , right in the middle of this rainforest , was some solar panels — the first in that part of Ecuador — and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn &apos;t have to go down ."
"The water was cleaned , but because they got a lot of batteries , they were able to store a lot of electricity ."
"So every house — and there were , I think , eight houses in this little community — could have light for , I think it was about half an hour each evening ."
"And there is the Chief , in all his regal finery , with a laptop computer ."
"( Laughter ) And this man , he has been outside , but he &apos;s gone back , and he was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era , and we didn &apos;t even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with laptop computers , and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world ."
We want to know about health care .
We want to know about what other people do — we &apos;re interested in it .
And we want to learn other languages .
"We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese , and we &apos;re good at languages . &quot; &quot; So there he is with his little laptop computer , but fighting against the might of the pressures — because of the debt , the foreign debt of Ecuador — fighting the pressure of World Bank , IMF , and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil ."
"And so , coming directly from there to here ."
"But , of course , my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization — I can &apos;t really call it a civilization ."
"A different way of life , a different being ."
We &apos;ve talked earlier — this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world — but the world is not composed only of human beings ; there are also other animal beings .
"And I propose to bring into this TED conference , as I always do around the world , the voice of the animal kingdom ."
"Too often we just see a few slides , or a bit of film , but these beings have voices that mean something ."
"And so , I want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania — Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !"
( Applause ) I &apos;ve been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960 .
"During that time , there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work ."
"For example , for the first time , a few years ago , by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed — to have DNA profiling done — so for the first time , we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant ."
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society .
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research .
"And we use GSI — geographic whatever it is , GSI — to determine the range of the chimps ."
And we &apos;re using — you can see that I &apos;m not really into this kind of stuff — but we &apos;re using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area .
"And of course , there &apos;s developments in infrared , so you can watch animals at night , and equipment for recording by video , and tape recording is getting lighter and better ."
"So in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when I began in 1960 ."
"Especially when chimpanzees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in captivity , modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals ."
"So that we know today , they &apos;re capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began ."
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan — her name means love — and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her .
"She loves her computer — she &apos;ll leave her big group , and her running water , and her trees and everything ."
And she &apos;ll come in to sit at this computer — it &apos;s like a video game for a kid ; she &apos;s hooked .
"She &apos;s 28 , by the way , and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans ."
"She does very complex tasks , and I haven &apos;t got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn &apos;t like making mistakes ."
"If she has a bad run , and her score isn &apos;t good , she &apos;ll come and reach up and tap on the glass — because she can &apos;t see the experimenter — which is asking to have another go ."
"And her concentration — she &apos;s already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so , and now she wants to do it all over again , just for the satisfaction of having done it better ."
"And the food is not important — she does get a tiny reward , like one raisin for a correct response — but she will do it for nothing , if you tell her beforehand ."
"So here we are , a chimpanzee using a computer ."
"Chimpanzees , gorillas , orangutans also learn human sign language ."
"But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 — I remember so well , so vividly , as though it was yesterday — the first time , when I was going through the vegetation , the chimpanzees were still running away from me , for the most part , although some were a little bit acclimatized — and I saw this dark shape , hunched over a termite mound , and I peered with my binoculars ."
"It was , fortunately , one adult male whom I &apos;d named David Greybeard — and by the way , science at that time was telling me that I shouldn &apos;t name the chimps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific ."
"Anyway , David Greybeard — and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest ."
And not only that — he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves — modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose — the beginning of tool-making .
"The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time , it was thought that humans , and only humans , used and made tools ."
"When I was at school , we were defined as man , the toolmaker ."
"So that when Louis Leakey , my mentor , heard this news , he said , &quot; &quot; Ah , we must now redefine &apos; man , &apos; redefine &apos; tool , &apos; or accept chimpanzees as humans . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We now know that at Gombe alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes ."
"Moreover , we know that in different parts of Africa , wherever chimps have been studied , there are completely different tool-using behaviors ."
"And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next , through observation , imitation and practice — that is a definition of human culture ."
"What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes , and , as I say , other mammals with complex brains and social systems , we have found that after all , there isn &apos;t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom ."
It &apos;s a very wuzzy line .
"It &apos;s getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we , in our arrogance , used to think was just human ."
"The chimps — there &apos;s no time to discuss their fascinating lives — but they have this long childhood , five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother , and then another three , four or five years of emotional dependence on her , even when the next child is born ."
"The importance of learning in that time , when behavior is flexible — and there &apos;s an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society ."
"The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and sisters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years ."
"They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity , so we &apos;ve only done 40 years in the wild so far ."
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
"We find in their non-verbal communication — this is very rich — they have a lot of sounds , which they use in different circumstances , but they also use touch , posture , gesture , and what do they do ?"
They kiss ; they embrace ; they hold hands .
"They pat one another on the back ; they swagger ; they shake their fist — the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of context ."
They have very sophisticated cooperation .
"Sometimes they hunt — not that often , but when they hunt , they show sophisticated cooperation , and they share the prey ."
"We find that they show emotions , similar to — maybe sometimes the same — as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair ."
They know mental as well as physical suffering .
"And I don &apos;t have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you , save to say that there are very bright students , in the best universities , studying emotions in animals , studying personalities in animals ."
"We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors — &quot; &quot; self &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; They have a sense of humor , and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives ."
"But this teaches us a new respect — and it &apos;s a new respect not only for the chimpanzees , I suggest , but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet ."
"Once we &apos;re prepared to admit that after all , we &apos;re not the only beings with personalities , minds and above all feelings , and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient , sapient creatures on this planet , it really gives cause for deep shame , at least for me ."
"So , the sad thing is that these chimpanzees — who &apos;ve perhaps taught us , more than any other creature , a little humility — are in the wild , disappearing very fast ."
They &apos;re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
"The deforestation , the growth of human populations , needing more land ."
They &apos;re disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting .
They &apos;re disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads — as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched — to take out oil or timber .
"And this has led in Congo basin , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bush-meat trade ."
"This means that although for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years , people have lived in those forests , or whatever habitat it is , in harmony with their world , just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families — now , suddenly , because of the roads , the hunters can go in from the towns ."
"They shoot everything , every single thing that moves that &apos;s bigger than a small rat ; they sun-dry it or smoke it ."
And now they &apos;ve got transport ; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it .
"And people will pay more for bush-meat , as it &apos;s called , than for domestic meat — it &apos;s culturally preferred ."
"And it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted ."
They &apos;re given weapons ; they shoot for the logging camps ; they get money .
"Their culture is being destroyed , along with the animals upon whom they depend ."
"So , when the logging camp moves , there &apos;s nothing left ."
"We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity , and I &apos;ve seen it happening with my own eyes ."
"And the grim picture in Africa — I love Africa , and what do we see in Africa ?"
"We see deforestation ; we see the desert spreading ; we see massive hunger ; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support , and they &apos;re too poor to buy food from elsewhere ."
"Were the people that we heard about yesterday , on the Easter Island , who cut down their last tree — were they stupid ?"
Didn &apos;t they know what was happening ?
"Of course , but if you &apos;ve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s leave the tree for tomorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How am I going to feed my family today ?"
"Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer , and then we &apos;ll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end . &quot; &quot; So , this is a pretty grim picture ."
"The one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures , is this sophisticated spoken language — a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here ."
"We can talk about the distant past , plan for the distant future , discuss ideas with each other , so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group ."
We can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the written word .
"And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards , and we &apos;re destroying the world ."
"In the developed world , in a way , it &apos;s worse , because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we &apos;re doing ."
"Do you know , we &apos;re bringing little babies into a world where , in many places , the water is poisoning them ?"
"And the air is harming them , and the food that &apos;s grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them ."
And that &apos;s not just in the far-away developing world ; that &apos;s everywhere .
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn &apos;t have about 50 years ago ?
"And so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped ."
"We &apos;re harming ourselves around the world , as well as harming the animals , as well as harming nature herself — Mother Nature , that brought us into being ; Mother Nature , where I believe we need to spend time , where there &apos;s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development ."
"And yet , there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature , because they &apos;re growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality , with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun , or in the forest , with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above ."
"As I was traveling around the world , you know , I had to leave the forest — that &apos;s where I love to be ."
"I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because , finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now , I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world ."
"And the more I talked about the chimpanzees &apos; plight , the more I realized the fact that everything &apos;s interconnected , and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world , and everything was joining together , and making — not sense , hope lies in sense , you said — it &apos;s making a nonsense ."
How can we do it ?
Somebody said that yesterday .
"And as I was traveling around , I kept meeting young people who &apos;d lost hope ."
"They were feeling despair , they were feeling , &quot; &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we do ; eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we die ."
"Everything is hopeless — we &apos;re always being told so by the media . &quot; &quot; And then I met some who were angry , and anger that can turn to violence , and we &apos;re all familiar with that ."
"And I have three little grandchildren , and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re angry , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; We &apos;re filled with despair , because we feel you &apos;ve compromised our future , and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot; &quot; And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren , and think how much we &apos;ve harmed this planet since I was their age ."
"I feel this deep shame , and that &apos;s why in 1991 in Tanzania , I started a program that &apos;s called Roots and Shoots ."
"There &apos;s little brochures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , I beg that you pick up that brochure ."
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope .
Roots make a firm foundation .
"Shoots seem tiny , but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls ."
See the brick walls as all the problems that we &apos;ve inflicted on this planet .
"Then , you see , it is a message of hope ."
"Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through , and can make this a better world ."
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference .
Every individual has a role to play .
"Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday , and you scientists know that you can &apos;t actually — even if you stay in bed all day , you &apos;re breathing oxygen and giving out CO2 , and probably going to the loo , and things like that — you &apos;re making a difference in the world ."
"So , the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects ."
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place .
One project to show care and concern for your own human community .
"One for animals , including domestic animals — and I have to say , I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog , Rusty , who was my childhood companion ."
And the third kind of project : something for the local environment .
"So what the kids do depends first of all , how old are they — and we go now from pre-school right through university ."
It &apos;s going to depend whether they &apos;re inner-city or rural .
It &apos;s going to depend if they &apos;re wealthy or impoverished .
"It &apos;s going to depend which part , say , of America they &apos;re in ."
"We &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York ."
"It &apos;s going to depend on which country they &apos;re in — and we &apos;re already in 60-plus countries , with about 5,000 active groups — and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I &apos;ve never even heard of , because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves ."
Why ?
"Because they &apos;re buying into it , and they &apos;re the ones who get to decide what they &apos;re going to do ."
"It isn &apos;t something that their parents tell them , or their teachers tell them ."
"That &apos;s effective , but if they decide themselves , &quot; &quot; We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there ."
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden .
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories .
We want to go and work in a dog shelter .
"We want to learn about animals . We want ... &quot; &quot; You know , it goes on and on , and this is very hopeful for me ."
"As I travel around the world 300 days a year , everywhere there &apos;s a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages ."
"Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying , &quot; Look at the difference we &apos;ve made . &quot;"
"And now comes the technology into it , because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world ."
"And if anyone is interested to help us , we &apos;ve got so many ideas but we need help — we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement ."
"But also — and this is so important — to communicate their despair , to say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what shall we do ? &quot; &quot; And then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in America , or maybe this is a group in Israel , saying , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . This is how you should do it . &quot; &quot; The philosophy is very simple ."
We do not believe in violence .
"No violence , no bombs , no guns ."
That &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
"Violence leads to violence , at least in my view ."
So how do we solve ?
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding .
"Know the facts , but see how they fit in the big picture ."
Hard work and persistence — don &apos;t give up — and love and compassion leading to respect for all life .
"How many more minutes ? Two , one ?"
Chris Anderson : One — one to two .
"Jane Goodall : Two , two , I &apos;m going to take two ."
( Laughter ) Are you going to come and drag me off ? ( Laughter )
"Anyway — so basically , Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people &apos;s lives ."
It &apos;s what I &apos;m devoting most of my energy to .
"And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children ."
"And if you take this program out , and give it to your children , they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good , because they &apos;ve got parents like you ."
And it &apos;s been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .
It &apos;s very encouraging .
"But the kids do ask me — and this won &apos;t take more than two minutes , I promise — the kids say , &quot; &quot; Dr. Jane , do you really have hope for the future ?"
"You travel , you see all these horrible things happening . &quot; &quot; Firstly , the human brain — I don &apos;t need to say anything about that ."
"Now that we know what the problems are around the world , human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems ."
And we &apos;ve talked a lot about that .
"Secondly , the resilience of nature ."
"We can destroy a river , and we can bring it back to life ."
"We can see a whole area desolated , and it can be brought back to bloom again , with time or a little help ."
"And thirdly , the last speaker talked about — or the speaker before last , talked about the indomitable human spirit ."
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible .
"Nelson Mandela — I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison , where he labored for 27 years , and came out with so little bitterness , he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath ."
"Even after the 11th of September — and I was in New York and I felt the fear — nevertheless , there was so much human courage , so much love and so much compassion ."
"And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear — the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn &apos;t worry about the environment any more , in case they seemed not to be patriotic — and I was trying to encourage them , somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi , &quot; &quot; If you look back through human history , you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good . &quot; &quot; And just after that a woman brought me this little bell , and I want to end on this note ."
"She said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re talking about hope and peace , ring this ."
"This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine , from the killing fields of Pol Pot — one of the most evil regimes in human history — where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled ."
"So , yes , there is hope , and where is the hope ?"
Is it out there with the politicians ?
It &apos;s in our hands .
It &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
It &apos;s really up to us .
We &apos;re the ones who can make a difference .
"If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints , if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don &apos;t buy the things that are not , we can change the world overnight ."
Thank you .
"Mark Zuckerberg , a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed ."
"And the journalist was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Zuckerberg said , &quot; &quot; A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like ."
"So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine , the Internet meant something very different to me ."
It meant a connection to the world .
It meant something that would connect us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t pay attention to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time — my Facebook page .
"I &apos;m progressive , politically — big surprise — but I &apos;ve always gone out of my way to meet conservatives ."
I like hearing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like seeing what they link to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on , and it was noticing that , actually , I was clicking more on my liberal friends &apos; links than on my conservative friends &apos; links ."
"And without consulting me about it , it had edited them out ."
They disappeared .
"So Facebook isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of invisible , algorithmic editing of the Web ."
Google &apos;s doing it too .
"If I search for something , and you search for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different search results ."
Think about it for a second : there is no standard Google anymore .
"And you know , the funny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your search results are from anyone else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my friend Scott &apos;s screen shot .
And here &apos;s my friend Daniel &apos;s screen shot .
"When you put them side-by-side , you don &apos;t even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are ."
"But when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable ."
Daniel didn &apos;t get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results .
Scott &apos;s results were full of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization .
"Yahoo News , the biggest news site on the Internet , is now personalized — different people get different things ."
"Huffington Post , the Washington Post , the New York Times — all flirting with personalization in various ways ."
"And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see , but not necessarily what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these filters together , you take all these algorithms , you get what I call a filter bubble ."
"And your filter bubble is your own personal , unique universe of information that you live in online ."
"And what &apos;s in your filter bubble depends on who you are , and it depends on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t decide what gets in .
"And more importantly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets edited out ."
So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix .
"They enter the queue , they just zip right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; Iron Man &quot; &quot; zips right out , and &quot; &quot; Waiting for Superman &quot; &quot; can wait for a really long time ."
What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there &apos;s this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has watched &quot; &quot; Rashomon , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; &quot; for the fourth time ."
It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan .
It gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
"And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance ."
"And instead of a balanced information diet , you can end up surrounded by information junk food ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
And the thing is that the algorithms don &apos;t yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .
"So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to decide what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just keyed to relevance ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important — this is what TED does — other points of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 1915 , it &apos;s not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities ."
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a functioning democracy if citizens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed ."
"It wasn &apos;t perfect , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 1915 on the Web ."
And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they &apos;re writing .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google — Larry and Sergey — people who have helped build the Web as it is , and I &apos;m grateful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civic responsibility ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
We need it to connect us all together .
We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one .
Thank you .

"What you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is killing you ."
"More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your tush ."
"Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re sleeping , at 7.7 hours ."
"Sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even occur to us that it &apos;s not okay ."
"In that way , sitting has become the smoking of our generation ."
"Of course there &apos;s health consequences to this , scary ones , besides the waist ."
"Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical &#91; activity &#93; , Ten percent in fact , on both of those ."
"Six percent for heart disease , seven percent for type 2 diabetes , which is what my father died of ."
"Now , any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t ."
What did get me moving was a social interaction .
"Someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; I have to walk my dogs tomorrow . Could you come then ? &quot;"
"It seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , I remember thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings , I ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of obligations , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , several hundred of these walking meetings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"First , there &apos;s this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking ."
"Whether it &apos;s nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works ."
"And second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to solve problems and look at the world really differently , whether it &apos;s in governance or business or environmental issues , job creation , maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable .
"So I started this talk talking about the tush , so I &apos;ll end with the bottom line , which is , walk and talk ."
Walk the talk .
"You &apos;ll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas ."
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
Why consciousness ?
"Well , it &apos;s a curiously neglected subject , both in our scientific and our philosophical culture ."
Now why is that curious ?
So consciousness is number one .
"The second reason is that when people do get interested in it , as I think they should , they tend to say the most appalling things ."
"And then , even when they &apos;re not saying appalling things and they &apos;re really trying to do serious research , well , it &apos;s been slow . Progress has been slow ."
"When I first got interested in this , I thought , well , it &apos;s a straightforward problem in biology ."
"Okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?"
"Well , I think it &apos;s a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they &apos;re opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions ."
One feature is the tradition of religious dualism : Consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
It &apos;s a part of the spiritual world .
"It belongs to the soul , and the soul is not a part of the physical world ."
"That &apos;s the tradition of God , the soul and immortality ."
"Either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science ."
And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache .
"Science is objective , consciousness is subjective , therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness ."
"Okay , so these twin traditions are paralyzing us ."
It &apos;s very hard to get out of these twin traditions .
"And I have only one real message in this lecture , and that is , consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis , digestion , mitosis — you know all the biological phenomena — and once you accept that , most , though not all , of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate ."
And I &apos;m going to go through some of them .
"Okay , now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness ."
One : Consciousness does not exist .
"It &apos;s an illusion , like sunsets ."
Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions .
So consciousness is an illusion .
"Two : Well , maybe it exists , but it &apos;s really something else ."
It &apos;s a computer program running in the brain .
"Three : No , the only thing that exists is really behavior ."
"It &apos;s embarrassing how influential behaviorism was , but I &apos;ll get back to that ."
"And four : Maybe consciousness exists , but it can &apos;t make any difference to the world ."
How could spirituality move anything ?
Some days it goes up and some days it doesn &apos;t go up . &quot; &quot; No . It goes up whenever I damn well want it to .
Okay . I &apos;m going to tell you how that &apos;s possible .
"Now , I haven &apos;t yet given you a definition ."
You can &apos;t do this if you don &apos;t give a definition .
People always say consciousness is very hard to define .
I think it &apos;s rather easy to define if you &apos;re not trying to give a scientific definition .
"We &apos;re not ready for a scientific definition , but here &apos;s a common-sense definition ."
"It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep , and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious ."
Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
"Now , that &apos;s the common-sense definition . That &apos;s our target ."
"If you &apos;re not talking about that , you &apos;re not talking about consciousness ."
"But they think , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s it , that &apos;s an awful problem ."
"How can such a thing exist as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; And this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosophy course , this is known as the famous mind-body problem ."
I think that has a simple solution too . I &apos;m going to give it to you .
"And here it is : All of our conscious states , without exception , are caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain , and they are realized in the brain as higher-level or system features ."
It &apos;s about as mysterious as the liquidity of water .
It &apos;s a condition that the system is in .
The famous mind-body problem is that simple .
All right ? But now we get into some harder questions .
"Let &apos;s specify the exact features of consciousness , so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it ."
"Well , the first feature is , it &apos;s real and irreducible ."
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
"You see , the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are ."
"It consciously seems like there &apos;s — I like the French &quot; &quot; arc-en-ciel &quot; &quot; — it seems like there &apos;s an arch in the sky , or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains ."
"It consciously seems to us , but that &apos;s not really happening ."
"But for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are , you can &apos;t make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness , because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned , if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious , you are conscious ."
It &apos;s real and irreducible .
You cannot get rid of it by showing that it &apos;s an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions .
"Okay , the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us , and that is , all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them ."
Maybe we &apos;ll be able to build a conscious machine .
Okay . Another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields .
"So I don &apos;t just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor , but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward ."
That is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness .
And we have not been able to do that in a robot .
"The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don &apos;t know how to make a conscious robot , so we don &apos;t have a machine that can do this kind of thing ."
"Okay , the next feature of consciousness , after this marvelous unified conscious field , is that it functions causally in our behavior ."
"I gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand , but how is that possible ?"
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects ?
"Well , I &apos;ll tell you the answer ."
"I mean , we don &apos;t know the detailed answer , but we know the basic part of the answer , and that is , there is a sequence of neuron firings , and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons ."
"Now , think of what I told you ."
"One and the same event , my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy-feely spiritual qualities ."
"Now , what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete ."
"One and the same event has a level of description where it &apos;s neurobiological , and another level of description where it &apos;s mental , and that &apos;s a single event , and that &apos;s how nature works . That &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consciousness to function causally ."
"Okay , now with that in mind , with going through these various features of consciousness , let &apos;s go back and answer some of those early objections ."
"Well , the first one I said was , consciousness doesn &apos;t exist , it &apos;s an illusion . Well , I &apos;ve already answered that ."
I don &apos;t think we need to worry about that .
"But the second one had an incredible influence , and may still be around , and that is , &quot; &quot; Well , if consciousness exists , it &apos;s really something else ."
It &apos;s really a digital computer program running in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
"You get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code , and that &apos;s the defining trait of the computer program ."
But we know that that &apos;s purely syntactical . That &apos;s symbolic .
We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
It &apos;s got a content in addition to the syntax .
It &apos;s got a semantics .
"It creates a reality of money , property , government , marriage , CERN conferences , cocktail parties and summer vacations , and all of those are creations of consciousness ."
Their existence is observer-relative .
It &apos;s only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university .
"Now , ask yourself about computation ."
"Is that absolute , like force and mass and gravitational attraction ?"
Or is it observer-relative ?
"Well , some computations are intrinsic ."
I add two plus two to get four .
That &apos;s going on no matter what anybody thinks .
"But when I haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation , the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior ."
That &apos;s the only absolute phenomenon .
Computation only exists relative to consciousness .
"Either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation ."
Now that doesn &apos;t mean computation is arbitrary .
I spent a lot of money on this hardware .
That &apos;s a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity .
"You can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that &apos;s what neurologists do ."
Your mental states are identical with your behavior ?
You &apos;re giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
Thank you very much .

I grew up in a very small country town in Victoria .
"I had a very normal , low-key kind of upbringing ."
"I went to school , I hung out with my friends , I fought with my younger sisters ."
It was all very normal .
"And my parents said , &quot; &quot; Hm , that &apos;s really nice , but there &apos;s kind of one glaring problem with that ."
"She hasn &apos;t actually achieved anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they were right , you know ."
"Yeah , I know . What a contradiction ."
"But they were right , you know ."
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all .
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation .
"Years later , I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourne high school , and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said , &quot; Hey miss , when are you going to start doing your speech ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , like , your motivational speaking ."
And that &apos;s when it dawned on me : This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration .
"We are not , to this kid — and it &apos;s not his fault , I mean , that &apos;s true for many of us ."
"For lots of us , disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists ."
We &apos;re not real people . We are there to inspire .
"Well , ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to disappoint you dramatically ."
I am not here to inspire you .
"It &apos;s a bad thing , and to live with a disability makes you exceptional ."
"It &apos;s not a bad thing , and it doesn &apos;t make you exceptional ."
"And in the past few years , we &apos;ve been able to propagate this lie even further via social media ."
You may have seen images like this one : &quot; The only disability in life is a bad attitude . &quot;
Or this one : &quot; &quot; Your excuse is invalid . &quot; &quot; Indeed .
"Or this one : &quot; &quot; Before you quit , try ! &quot; &quot; These are just a couple of examples , but there are a lot of these images out there ."
You might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs .
"And these images , there are lots of them out there , they are what we call inspiration porn ."
"( Laughter ) And I use the term porn deliberately , because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people ."
"So in this case , we &apos;re objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people ."
"The purpose of these images is to inspire you , to motivate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; &quot; Well , however bad my life is , it could be worse ."
I could be that person . &quot; &quot; But what if you are that person ?
They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name . ( Laughter ) And it is objectifying .
"These images , those images objectify disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people ."
"They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren &apos;t so bad for you , to put your worries into perspective ."
And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult .
We do overcome some things .
But the things that we &apos;re overcoming are not the things that you think they are .
They are not things to do with our bodies .
"I use the term &quot; &quot; disabled people &quot; &quot; quite deliberately , because I subscribe to what &apos;s called the social model of disability , which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses ."
So I have lived in this body a long time .
I &apos;m quite fond of it .
"It does the things that I need it to do , and I &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pictures as well ."
They &apos;re not doing anything out of the ordinary .
They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity .
"So is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do , to share those images ?"
"People , when they say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re an inspiration , &quot; &quot; they mean it as a compliment ."
And I know why it happens .
"It &apos;s because of the lie , it &apos;s because we &apos;ve been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional ."
And it honestly doesn &apos;t .
And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
"You know , I &apos;m up here bagging out inspiration , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Jeez , Stella , aren &apos;t you inspired sometimes by some things ? &quot; &quot; And the thing is , I am ."
I learn from other disabled people all the time .
"I &apos;m learning not that I am luckier than them , though ."
Genius .
"We are learning from each others &apos; strength and endurance , not against our bodies and our diagnoses , but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us ."
I really think that this lie that we &apos;ve been sold about disability is the greatest injustice .
It makes life hard for us .
"And that quote , &quot; &quot; The only disability in life is a bad attitude , &quot; &quot; the reason that that &apos;s bullshit is because it &apos;s just not true , because of the social model of disability ."
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp .
Never . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Smiling at a television screen isn &apos;t going to make closed captions appear for people who are deaf .
No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop and radiating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into braille .
It &apos;s just not going to happen .
"I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm ."
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl sitting in her bedroom watching &quot; &quot; Buffy the Vampire Slayer &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t referred to as achieving anything because she &apos;s doing it sitting down . I want to live in a world
where we don &apos;t have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning .
"I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people , and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user ."
"Disability doesn &apos;t make you exceptional , but questioning what you think you know about it does ."
Thank you .

"Carlos , the Vietnam vet Marine who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one ."
"In 1971 , he was medically retired because he had so much shrapnel in his body that he was setting off metal detectors ."
"For the next 42 years , he suffered from nightmares , extreme anxiety in public , isolation , depression ."
He self-medicated with alcohol .
He was married and divorced three times .
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder .
"And so , we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
We put some veterans on heavy drugs .
"Others we hospitalized and gave generic group therapy , and others still we simply said to them , &quot; Just go home and try to forget about your experiences . &quot;"
"Now , making war — this is something that we are good at ."
We humans have been making war since before we were even fully human .
"And since then , we have gone from using stone and sinew to developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable ."
We are good at making war .
And we are good at training our warriors to fight .
"Yet , when we consider the experience of the modern-day combat veteran , we begin to see that we have not been as good at preparing them to come home ."
Why is that ?
"Well , our ancestors lived immersed in conflict , and they fought right where they lived ."
"So until only very recently in our evolutionary history , there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war , because we never really did ."
But just imagine for a moment what this must feel like .
&quot; &quot; Mindfuck &quot; &quot; is the most common term .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the most common term I &apos;ve heard to describe that experience .
"Now , the same holds for training-based treatments ."
"The first of these treatments is cognitive therapy , and this is a kind of mental recalibration ."
"So when you try to overlay that mind frame onto a peacetime environment , you get problems ."
You begin drowning in worries about dangers that aren &apos;t present .
You begin not trusting family or friends .
Which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life ; there are .
So we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely .
"We do train them , however , to adjust caution according to where they are ."
Out to dinner with family ?
"We train veterans to be fiercely rational , to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability of encountering , say , an IED here in peacetime America ."
This was the treatment that he chose .
"And , critically — staying in these environments ."
"Now , at first he was very anxious ."
"And he wanted to leave , but he didn &apos;t ."
"He remembered his training in the Marine Corps , and he pushed through his discomfort ."
"He also listened to recordings of his combat experiences , over and over and over ."
He listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety .
"Veterans will always remember their traumatic experiences , but with enough practice , those memories are no longer as raw or as painful as they once were ."
"They don &apos;t feel emotionally like they just happened yesterday , and that is an immensely better place to be ."
"And , like any training , it may not work for everybody ."
And there are trust issues .
"Sometimes I &apos;m asked , &quot; If you haven &apos;t been there , Doc , how can you help me ? &quot;"
"But at the point of returning to civilian life , you do not require somebody who &apos;s been there ."
You don &apos;t require training for operations on the battlefield ; you require training on how to come home .
"For the past 10 years of my work , I have been exposed to detailed accounts of the worst experiences that you can imagine , daily ."
And it hasn &apos;t always been easy .
There have been times where I have just felt my heart break or that I &apos;ve absorbed too much .
I see people &apos;s lives transform .
"Carlos can now enjoy outings with his grandchildren , which is something he couldn &apos;t even do with his own children ."
"And what &apos;s amazing to me is that after 43 years of suffering , it only took him 10 weeks of intense training to get his life back ."
Because ...
"this life is short , and if you are fortunate enough to have survived war or any kind of traumatic experience , you owe it to yourself to live your life well ."
"Now , the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war ."
"Until we are , the mental suffering that we create in our sons and in our daughters when we send them off to fight can be alleviated ."
"This much , we owe them ."
Thank you .

I &apos;m just going to play a brief video clip .
"Video : On the fifth of December 1985 , a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds — nine times the previous world record ."
"The buyer was Kip Forbes , son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century ."
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century .
"Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar ."
"Benjamin Wallace : Now , that &apos;s about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world ."
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock .
"In 1985 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery ."
"Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall , and happened upon this hidden cache of wines — apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson . 1787 , 1784 ."
"He wouldn &apos;t reveal the exact number of bottles , he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building ."
The mystery persisted for about 20 years .
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy .
"Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious ."
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .
"There &apos;s now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man , and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes ."
"But for those 20 years , an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles ."
"I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world ."
"I became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?"
"So , I decided to embark on a quest ."
"With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes , I decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine ."
( Laughter ) This was the first one .
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing .
"It may come from Wagyu cattle , but it &apos;s not from the original , Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan ."
"There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe , and one of them is Wolfgang Puck &apos;s restaurant , Cut , in Los Angeles ."
"I went there , and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars ."
"And it arrived , and it was tiny ."
And I was outraged .
"It was like , 160 dollars for this ?"
"And then I took a bite , and I wished that it was tinier , because Kobe beef is so rich ."
It &apos;s like foie gras — it &apos;s not even like steak .
I almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
I was really happy when I was done .
"( Laughter ) Now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to see this recurring character ."
"Which , I guess , you know , communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price ."
White truffles .
One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world .
"To try this , I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan — Del Posto ."
"The waiter , you know , came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver , and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said , you know , &quot; Would Signore like the truffles ? &quot;"
And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma .
"It &apos;s not in their taste , really . It &apos;s not in their texture ."
It &apos;s in the smell .
"These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up ."
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
"And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served , and so I &apos;m afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me ."
There were several — several of these items were disappointments .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
The magazine wouldn &apos;t pay for me to go there .
"( Laughter ) They did give me a tour , though ."
"And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet ."
It has 360-degree views .
It has four balconies .
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei .
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver .
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from .
"When I took the tour , it actually included some Opus One , I was glad to see ."
"30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel ."
"This is soap that &apos;s made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties ."
I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this .
"And it , you know , tickled a little bit and it smelled good , but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today ."
"( Laughter ) But then again , nobody has complimented me on the jeans I &apos;m wearing ."
"These ones GQ did spring for — I own these — but I will tell you , not only did I not get a compliment from any of you , I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these ."
"I don &apos;t think that whether or not you &apos;re getting a compliment should be the test of something &apos;s value , but I think in the case of a fashion item , an article of clothing , that &apos;s a reasonable benchmark ."
"That said , a lot of work goes into these ."
They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times .
But no compliments .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany .
And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light .
"He uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas ."
"And he actually — once he releases a batch of it , he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online , so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing , and , you know , gauge its freshness ."
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils .
It tasted fine . It tasted interesting .
"It was very green , it was very peppery ."
"But in the blind taste test , it came in last ."
The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months .
( Laughter ) A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan — you &apos;ll start to notice .
"I don &apos;t play golf , so I couldn &apos;t actually road test these , but I did interview a guy who owns them ."
"Even the people who market these clubs — I mean , they &apos;ll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther — but they &apos;ll say , look , you know , you &apos;re not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs ."
"You &apos;re paying for the bling , that they &apos;re encrusted with gold and platinum ."
"The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he &apos;s gotten a lot of pleasure out of them , so ..."
"Oh , yeah , you know this one ?"
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process .
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet .
"It &apos;s a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations ."
"And apparently it &apos;s a very picky eater and it , you know , hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries ."
"And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans , and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats &apos; leavings then go through the forest collecting the , you know , results and processing it into coffee — although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form ."
That &apos;s right .
Unrelatedly — ( Laughter ) Japan is doing crazy things with toilets . ( Laughter )
There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it .
There &apos;s one with a fragrance dispenser .
There &apos;s one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor .
It &apos;s almost like a home medical center — and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in .
"This one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it &apos;s pretty much the best — the Neorest 600 ."
"And to try this — I couldn &apos;t get a loaner , but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , Toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which I used ."
"It &apos;s fully automated — you walk towards it , and the seat lifts ."
The seat is preheated .
There &apos;s a water jet that cleans you .
There &apos;s an air jet that dries you .
"You get up , it flushes by itself ."
"The lid closes , it self-cleans ."
"Not only is it a technological leap forward , but I really do believe it &apos;s a bit of a cultural leap forward ."
"I mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet ."
And I want to get one of these .
( Laughter ) This was another one I could not get a loaner of .
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed .
"There &apos;s a little plaque on the end that , you know , each buyer gets their name engraved on it ."
"( Laughter ) To try this one , the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom ."
"Lights glaring in off the street , and we had to hire a security guard and all these things ."
"But anyway , we had a great night &apos;s sleep ."
And you spend a third of your life in bed .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a deal .
( Laughter ) This was a fun one .
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car .
"I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company , a professional race car driver , and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway ."
"And , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods ."
And it was really amazing .
It was such a smooth ride .
"Most of the cars that I drive , if I get up to 80 they start to rattle ."
"I switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , &quot; You know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . &quot;"
"And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic , because it was just that smooth ."
"And if I was a billionaire , I would get one ."
( Laughter ) This is a completely gratuitous video I &apos;m just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology .
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the &quot; &quot; Mission : Impossible III &quot; &quot; premiere .
"When he tries to open the door , you could call it &quot; &quot; Mission : Impossible IV . &quot; &quot; There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc ."
The &apos; 47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century .
And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape .
"And 1947 was a legendary vintage , especially in the right bank of Bordeaux ."
"And just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following ."
But it &apos;s 60 years old .
There &apos;s not much of it left .
What there is of it left you don &apos;t know if it &apos;s real — it &apos;s considered to be the most faked wine in the world .
Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist .
"So , I &apos;d about given up trying to get my hands on one of these ."
"I &apos;d put out feelers to retailers , to auctioneers , and it was coming up empty ."
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai .
"Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a tasting coming up where we &apos;re going to serve the &apos; 47 Cheval Blanc . &quot; &quot; And it was going to be a double vertical — it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc , and 30 vintages of Yquem ."
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .
I went .
"It was three days , four meals ."
"And at lunch on Saturday , we opened the &apos; 47 ."
"And you know , it had this fragrant softness , and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil ."
"And then I tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine — that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways ."
"There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic ."
There were some people who were a little less impressed .
And I wasn &apos;t that impressed .
"And I don &apos;t — call my palate a philistine palate — so it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean something that I wasn &apos;t impressed , but I was not the only one there who had that reaction ."
And it wasn &apos;t just to that wine .
"Any one of the wines served at this tasting , if I &apos;d been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my lifetime , and incredibly memorable ."
"But drinking 60 great wines over three days , they all just blurred together , and it became almost a grueling experience ."
And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech .
"And they gave subjects the same wine , labeled with different price tags ."
"A lot of people , you know , said that they liked the more expensive wine more — it was the same wine , but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive ."
"But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more — their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag ."
Thank you .
How do you observe something you can &apos;t see ?
This is the basic question of somebody who &apos;s interested in finding and studying black holes .
"Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it , not even light , so you can &apos;t see it directly ."
"So , my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole ."
"I &apos;m interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive , what we like to call &quot; &quot; supermassive &quot; &quot; black hole at the center of our galaxy ."
And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist .
"And second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in ."
"So , to begin with , we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole ."
"So , what is a black hole ?"
"Well , in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object , because there are only three characteristics that you can describe : the mass , the spin , and the charge ."
And I &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
"So , in that sense , it &apos;s a very simple object ."
"But in another sense , it &apos;s an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe , and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe ."
"But today , the way I want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume ."
"So , despite the fact that I &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s supermassive , and I &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no finite size ."
"So , this is a little tricky ."
"But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see , and that &apos;s known as the Schwarzschild radius ."
And that &apos;s named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius .
"This is a virtual radius , not reality ; the black hole has no size ."
So why is it so important ?
It &apos;s important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole .
"That means you , your neighbor , your cellphone , the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius ."
"At that point , what &apos;s going to happen ?"
At that point gravity wins .
Gravity wins over all other known forces .
And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object .
And then it &apos;s a black hole .
"So , if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube , it would become a black hole , because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius ."
"Now , the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is ."
And it turns out that it &apos;s actually pretty simple to figure out .
It depends only on the mass of the object .
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii .
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii .
"So , if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford , it would become a black hole ."
"So , now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is ."
"And it &apos;s actually quite a useful concept , because it tells us not only when a black hole will form , but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole ."
I only need two things .
"I need to understand the mass of the object I &apos;m claiming is a black hole , and what its Schwarzschild radius is ."
"And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius , there is actually only one thing I really need to know ."
"So , my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that &apos;s confined to within its Schwarzschild radius ."
And your job today is to be skeptical .
"Okay , so , I &apos;m going to talk about no ordinary black hole ; I &apos;m going to talk about supermassive black holes ."
"So , I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is , as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole ."
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star &apos;s life .
"So , if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun , it &apos;s going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here ."
And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun .
On an astronomical scale that &apos;s a very small black hole .
"Now , what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes ."
And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies .
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes .
There are big ones . There are little ones .
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy .
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left .
"And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy , just to give you a sense of scale ."
"And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy , which is the kind of galaxies that we &apos;re seeing here , comes from the light from the stars ."
"So , we see the galaxy because of the star light ."
"Now , there are a few relatively exotic galaxies ."
"I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show offs ."
And we call them active galactic nuclei .
"And we call them that because their nucleus , or their center , are very active ."
"So , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the starlight comes out from ."
"And yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be explained by the starlight ."
It &apos;s way more energetic .
"In fact , in a few examples it &apos;s like the ones that we &apos;re seeing here ."
There are also jets emanating out from the center .
"Again , a source of energy that &apos;s very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars ."
"So , what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to ."
"So , you can &apos;t see the black hole itself , but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see ."
"So , there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies ."
But it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
"Nonetheless , it &apos;s given rise to the notion that maybe it &apos;s not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes , but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers ."
And if that &apos;s the case — and this is an example of a normal galaxy ; what we see is the star light .
"And if there is a supermassive black hole , what we need to assume is that it &apos;s a black hole on a diet ."
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei .
"If we &apos;re going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies , the best place to look is in our own galaxy , our Milky Way ."
And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way .
And what we see is a line of stars .
"And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened , disk-like structure ."
"And we live in the middle of it , so when we look towards the center , we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy , or line that defines the plane of the galaxy ."
"Now , the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away ."
"So , we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in a moment , the ability to see detail is key to this experiment ."
"So , how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume ?"
Which is the job that I have to show you today .
And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole .
Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun .
It &apos;s the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .
"If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off , or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit ."
"So , this is great , because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume ."
"So , if I know how fast it goes around , I know the mass ."
And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius .
"So , I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible ."
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
"So , this means that I want to see a lot of detail ."
And that &apos;s the reason that for this experiment we &apos;ve used the world &apos;s largest telescope .
"This is the Keck observatory . It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters , which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court ."
"Now , this is wonderful , because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope , the smaller the detail that we can see ."
"But it turns out these telescopes , or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise ."
And that is because of the atmosphere .
Atmosphere is great for us ; it allows us to survive here on Earth .
But it &apos;s relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources .
"So , to give you a sense of what this is like , it &apos;s actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream ."
"Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream , the stream is continuously moving and turbulent , and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream ."
"Very much in the same way , it &apos;s very difficult to see astronomical sources , because of the atmosphere that &apos;s continuously moving by ."
"So , I &apos;ve spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere , to give us a cleaner view ."
And that buys us about a factor of 20 .
"And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20 , you &apos;ve probably improved your lifestyle by a lot , say your salary , you &apos;d notice , or your kids , you &apos;d notice ."
"And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use , called adaptive optics ."
"You &apos;re seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this technique — in other words , just a picture that shows the stars — and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is ."
"So , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars ."
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that &apos;s continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you .
"So , it &apos;s kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope ."
"Now , in the next few slides I &apos;m just going to focus on that little square there ."
"So , we &apos;re only going to look at the stars inside that small square , although we &apos;ve looked at all of them ."
"So , I want to see how these things have moved ."
"And over the course of this experiment , these stars have moved a tremendous amount ."
"So , we &apos;ve been doing this experiment for 15 years , and we see the stars go all the way around ."
"Now , most astronomers have a favorite star , and mine today is a star that &apos;s labeled up there , SO-2 ."
Absolutely my favorite star in the world .
And that &apos;s because it goes around in only 15 years .
"And to give you a sense of how short that is , the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy ."
"Stars that we knew about before , that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible , take 500 years ."
"And this one , this one goes around in a human lifetime ."
"That &apos;s kind of profound , in a way ."
But it &apos;s the key to this experiment . The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius .
"So , next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy ."
What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle .
"And as you can see , there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle ."
You can see a lot of stars .
"So , there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there ."
"But with this experiment , we &apos;ve confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that &apos;s 10,000 times smaller ."
"And because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there ."
"To give you a sense of how small that size is , that &apos;s the size of our solar system ."
"So , we &apos;re cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume ."
"Now , truth in advertising . Right ?"
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius .
"And the truth is , I &apos;m not quite there ."
But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .
"And , in fact , it &apos;s the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy , but any in our universe ."
"So , what next ? I actually think this is about as good as we &apos;re going to do with today &apos;s technology , so let &apos;s move on with the problem ."
"So , what I want to tell you , very briefly , is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy , now that we know that there is , or at least we believe , that there is a supermassive black hole there ."
"And the fun phase of this experiment is , while we &apos;ve tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy , almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see ."
And that &apos;s the fun .
"So , let me give you the two examples ."
"You can ask , &quot; &quot; What do you expect for the old stars , stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time , they &apos;ve had plenty of time to interact with the black hole . &quot; &quot; What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole ."
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .
"Likewise , for the young stars , or in contrast , the young stars , they just should not be there ."
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery .
"To get a star to form , you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse ."
And it &apos;s a very fragile entity .
And what does the big black hole do ?
It strips that gas cloud apart .
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart .
"In fact , we anticipated that star formation shouldn &apos;t proceed in that environment ."
"So , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars ."
"So , what do we see ?"
"Using observations that are not the ones I &apos;ve shown you today , we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young ."
The old ones are red .
"The young ones are blue . And the yellow ones , we don &apos;t know yet ."
"So , you can already see the surprise ."
There is a dearth of old stars .
"There is an abundance of young stars , so it &apos;s the exact opposite of the prediction ."
"So , this is the fun part ."
"And in fact , today , this is what we &apos;re trying to figure out , this mystery of how do you get — how do you resolve this contradiction ."
"So , in fact , my graduate students are , at this very moment , today , at the telescope , in Hawaii , making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage , where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars , and so few old stars ."
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away .
To do that we &apos;ll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today .
"Because , in truth , while I said we &apos;re correcting for the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced ."
"We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere , and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest ."
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
"And on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy ."
"So , we want to build a 30 meter telescope ."
And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy .
"And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein &apos;s theories of general relativity , some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form ."
"So , we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting ."
"So , in conclusion , I &apos;m going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving , in three dimensions ."
"And I hope , if nothing else , I &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy ."
"And this means that these things do exist in our universe , and we have to contend with this , we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world ."
"Second , we &apos;ve been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact , and understand , maybe , the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are , and how they work ."
"And last but not least , none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that &apos;s been made on the technology front ."
"And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast , and holds a lot in store for the future ."
Thanks very much .

I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor , living on less than one dollar a day ."
"I went to a very elitist , snobbish , expensive education in India , and that almost destroyed me ."
"I was all set to be a diplomat , teacher , doctor — all laid out ."
"Then , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was laid out for me .
Everything was at my feet .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of curiosity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 1965 , I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India , and I saw starvation , death , people dying of hunger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
Mother went into a coma .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is laid out for you , the best jobs are laid out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best eduction ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"No job , no money , no security , no prospect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and dig wells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dig wells for five years ?"
"You went to the most expensive school and college in India , and you want to dig wells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have , which are never brought into the mainstream — which is never identified , respected , applied on a large scale ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a Barefoot College — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"Elders came to me and said , &quot; &quot; Are you running from the police ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You failed in your exam ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"Is there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college . &quot; &quot; So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; Please , don &apos;t bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master &apos;s , you are disqualified to come ."
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a dignity of labor .
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community .
"So we started the Barefoot College , and we redefined professionalism ."
Who is a professional ?
"A professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief ."
A water diviner is a professional .
A traditional midwife is a professional .
A traditional bone setter is a professional .
These are professionals all over the world .
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal .
"It needs to be used , needs to be applied , needs to be shown to the world outside — that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today ."
So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi .
"You eat on the floor , you sleep on the floor , you work on the floor ."
"There are no contracts , no written contracts ."
"You can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to Barefoot College ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the Barefoot College ."
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
"Whatever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .
"Battered , bruised , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a certificate .
You are certified by the community you serve .
You don &apos;t need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986 .
"It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1.50 a sq. ft ."
"150 people lived there , worked there ."
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002 .
"But then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , they made the blueprints , but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia ."
"I asked a forester — high-powered , paper-qualified expert — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the soil and said , &quot; &quot; Forget it . No way ."
Not even worth it .
"No water , rocky soil . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a spot ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this spot ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked quietly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"Went to the roof , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; Clear out ."
The men should clear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is waterproofing the roof . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of jaggery , a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t leak .
"Since 1986 , it hasn &apos;t leaked ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully solar-electrified .
All the power comes from the sun .
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof .
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
"So long as the sun shines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest , a Hindu priest , who &apos;s only done eight years of primary schooling — never been to school , never been to college ."
He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed .
"Food , if you come to the Barefoot College , is solar cooked ."
"But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women , illiterate women , who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker ."
It &apos;s a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker .
"Unfortunately , they &apos;re almost half German , they &apos;re so precise ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find Indian women so precise .
"Absolutely to the last inch , they can make that cooker ."
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking .
"We have a dentist — she &apos;s a grandmother , illiterate , who &apos;s a dentist ."
"She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children ."
"Barefoot technology : this was 1986 — no engineer , no architect thought of it — but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs ."
Very little water is wasted .
"All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank , and no water is wasted ."
"If we have four years of drought , we still have water on the campus , because we collect rainwater ."
"60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after animals — sheep , goats — domestic chores ."
So we thought of starting a school at night for the children .
"Because the night schools of Tilonia , over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools ."
Because it &apos;s for the convenience of the child ; it &apos;s not for the convenience of the teacher .
And what do we teach in these schools ?
"Democracy , citizenship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if your animal is sick ."
This is what we teach in the night schools .
But all the schools are solar-lit .
Every five years we have an election .
"Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process , and they elect a prime minister ."
The prime minister is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 goats in the morning , but she &apos;s prime minister in the evening ."
"She has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health ."
"And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Children &apos;s Prize five years ago , and she went to Sweden ."
First time ever going out of her village .
Never seen Sweden .
Wasn &apos;t dazzled at all by what was happening .
"And the Queen of Sweden , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not dazzled by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said , &quot; &quot; Please tell her I &apos;m the prime minister . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high , we use puppetry ."
Puppets is the way we communicate .
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old .
He is my psychoanalyst . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doctor . He &apos;s my lawyer .
He &apos;s my donor .
"He actually raises money , solves my disputes ."
He solves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s tension in the village , if attendance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a friction between the teacher and the parent , the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; Shake hands ."
The attendance must not drop . &quot; &quot; These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this decentralized , demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages , we &apos;ve covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan — all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained ."
"And we went to Ladakh , and we asked this woman — this , at minus 40 , you have to come out of the roof , because there &apos;s no place , it was all snowed up on both sides — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the benefit you had from solar electricity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a minute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my husband &apos;s face in winter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Went to Afghanistan .
One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable .
"( Laughter ) Men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate . ( Laughter )"
"All across the globe , you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate ."
"Why ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great solution : train grandmothers .
What &apos;s the best way of communicating in the world today ?
Television ? No .
Telegraph ? No .
Telephone ? No .
Tell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to Afghanistan for the first time , and we picked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Impossible . They don &apos;t even go out of their rooms , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a concession . I &apos;ll take the husbands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the husbands along ."
"Of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we train these women ?"
Sign language .
You don &apos;t choose the written word .
You don &apos;t choose the spoken word .
You use sign language .
And in six months they can become solar engineers .
They go back and solar-electrify their own village .
"This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village , set up a workshop — the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This woman"
is an extraordinary grandmother .
"55 years old , and she &apos;s solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan ."
And they haven &apos;t collapsed .
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC .
He didn &apos;t know .
Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan .
"We went to Africa , and we did the same thing ."
"All these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speaking a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
"I went to Sierra Leone , and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night — comes across this village ."
"Comes back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grandmothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; The minister couldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Where did they go ? &quot; &quot; Went to India and back . &quot;
Went straight to the president .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he summoned me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you train me 150 grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , Mr. President ."
But they will . The grandmothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone .
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone .
Gambia : we went to select a grandmother in Gambia .
Went to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The community got together and said , &quot; &quot; Take these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; Difficult husband ; not possible . &quot;"
"Called the husband , the husband came , swaggering , politician , mobile in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she runs off with an Indian man ? &quot;"
That was his biggest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll ring you up on the mobile . &quot; &quot; She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger ."
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran .
"She handled the national press , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Where &apos;s your husband ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , somewhere . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Success story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just wind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solutions outside .
Look for solutions within .
And listen to people . They have the solutions in front of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
Don &apos;t even worry .
"Don &apos;t listen to the World Bank , listen to the people on the ground ."
They have all the solutions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi .
"&quot; &quot; First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , and then you win . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
"18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit , so I &apos;m going to dive straight in , right at the point where I get this thing to work ."
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
"I &apos;m going to talk about feasibility as well , of course ."
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
"Now , I want to ask a question ."
Hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ?
That was easy . OK .
OK . Hands up : anyone in the audience who &apos;s not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
And here is that characteristic .
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does .
"I mean , I know I &apos;m with a sympathetic audience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic ."
"And this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me ."
"You know , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time ."
"It &apos;s a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it ."
What part of this do people not understand ?
"It &apos;s not just about life , of course — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s about healthy life , you know — getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun , whether or not dying may be fun ."
"So really , this is how I would like to describe it ."
It &apos;s a global trance .
"But these are completely crazy , when you actually remember your sense of proportion ."
"You know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about ."
"But the question is , are they so dangerous — these risks of doing something about aging — that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ?"
"Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?"
"You know , if you haven &apos;t got an argument that &apos;s that strong , then just don &apos;t waste my time , is what I say ."
"( Laughter ) Now , there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong , and here it is ."
"I think it &apos;s true , that we will face a dilemma in this respect ."
"We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate , or a high death rate ."
"And , I say that that &apos;s fine — the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice ."
What &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging .
"Like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all ."
"But of course , that only works when we have both of these components ."
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .
"And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot — evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot — in order to get people &apos;s attention , and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard ."
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
"And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I &apos;m giving here ."
A very simple definition .
"Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place , which is to say , metabolism ."
This is not a completely tautological statement ; it &apos;s a reasonable statement .
"Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms , because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect ."
"So basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects ."
"And there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging ."
"They &apos;re what I &apos;m calling here the &quot; &quot; gerontology approach &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; geriatrics approach . &quot; &quot; The geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon ."
"The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface , because , you know , prevention is better than cure ."
But unfortunately the thing is that we don &apos;t understand metabolism very well .
"So then , what do we do about that ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?"
But it isn &apos;t .
"Before I tell you why it isn &apos;t , I &apos;m going to go a little bit into what I &apos;m calling step two ."
"Just suppose , as I said , that we do acquire — let &apos;s say we do it today for the sake of argument — the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age , let &apos;s say 55 ."
I &apos;m going to call that &quot; &quot; robust human rejuvenation . &quot; &quot; OK .
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
"There are two sorts of technological progress really , for this purpose ."
"There are fundamental , major breakthroughs , and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs ."
"Now , they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames ."
"We can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like ."
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
"So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all ."
"That in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp ."
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years .
"In other words , they will be staying ahead of the game ."
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
"Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more ."
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
"I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; &quot; longevity escape velocity . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , it seems to get the point across ."
"So , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive ."
"So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to , that the first 150-year-old — we don &apos;t know how old that person is today , because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take to get these first-generation therapies ."
"But irrespective of that age , I &apos;m claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 — subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes — is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old ."
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
"Alright , so finally I &apos;m going to spend the rest of the talk , my last seven-and-a-half minutes , on step one ; namely , how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity ?"
"And in order to do that , I need to talk about mice a little bit ."
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
"I &apos;m calling it &quot; &quot; robust mouse rejuvenation , &quot; &quot; not very imaginatively ."
And this is what it is .
"I say we &apos;re going to take a long-lived strain of mouse , which basically means mice that live about three years on average ."
We do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
"And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday ."
"Which we can now , as I &apos;ve explained , equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity ."
"Secondly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?"
"And thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?"
"And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it &apos;s extremely hard to answer ."
"One has to be very speculative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation , that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more ."
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
"We need to give our best guess as to the time frame , in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities ."
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
"They &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much ."
"That will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans , since it &apos;s been postponed so very effectively in mice ."
"So we &apos;re likely to end up with a very strong change in people &apos;s attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications ."
"So in order to tell you now how we &apos;re going to get these mice , I &apos;m going to add a little bit to my description of aging ."
But it is not part of metabolism itself .
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
And the reason it &apos;s a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
"And that &apos;s good because it means that it &apos;s not a losing battle , and it &apos;s something that we are within range of being able to do , because it doesn &apos;t involve improving on evolution ."
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
"It &apos;s a list of types of pathology that are age-related , and it &apos;s just an incomplete list ."
And there are only seven of them .
"They &apos;re categories of things , of course , but there &apos;s only seven of them ."
"Cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on ."
"First of all , I &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete ."
"The answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed — like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis — then the damage is gone , too ."
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
"Some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top ."
"I haven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my conclusion is that , if we can actually get suitable funding for this , then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years , but we do need to get serious about it ."
We do need to really start trying .
"So of course , there are some biologists in the audience , and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have ."
"You may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff ."
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I &apos;m predicting here .
"So if you think that I &apos;m wrong , you &apos;d better damn well go and find out why you think I &apos;m wrong ."
"And of course the main thing is that you shouldn &apos;t trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously ."
"So , you know , this does happen ."
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
"But , I mean , look — how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ?"
Not very long . OK .
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s got to be philanthropic , because profits distract biotech , but it &apos;s basically got a 90 percent chance , I think , of succeeding in this ."
And I think we know how to do it . And I &apos;ll stop there .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : OK . I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance .
"Audience : Since you &apos;ve been talking about aging and trying to defeat it , why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man ?"
( Laughter ) AG : Because I am an old man . I am actually 158 . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Audience : Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
"However , as far as I know , all the species have evolved to actually die , so when cells divide , the telomerase get shorter , and eventually species die ."
"So , why does — evolution has — seems to have selected against immortality , when it is so advantageous , or is evolution just incomplete ?"
AG : Brilliant . Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer .
CA : The genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
AG : That &apos;s right .
"Audience : Hello . I read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years ."
"If I project that , that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don &apos;t crash on my motorbike ."
"That means that I &apos;m one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old ?"
AG : If you lose a bit of weight .
( Laughter ) Your numbers are a bit out .
"If that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?"
"If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ?"
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
"Now , India is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity ."
"For me , the only relief from this heat is to drink plenty of water ."
"Now , while in India , my parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water , because unlike here in America , where I can just turn on a tap and easily get clean , potable water , in India , the water is often contaminated ."
"However , I soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to enjoy the clean water we did ."
"I even saw children , who looked the same age as me , filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside ."
"I wanted to know why these kids lacked water , a substance that is essential for life ."
"Now , this may seem surprising , as 75 percent of our planet is covered in water , but only 2.5 percent of that is freshwater , and less than one percent of Earth &apos;s freshwater supply is available for human consumption ."
"With rising populations , industrial development and economic growth , our demand for clean water is increasing , yet our freshwater resources are rapidly depleting ."
"According to the World Health Organization , 660 million people in our world lack access to a clean water source ."
"( Laughter ) Actually , at first I converted my kitchen into a laboratory , but my parents didn &apos;t really approve and kicked me out ."
"In SODIS , clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours ."
So what exactly is this photocatalysis ?
"Let &apos;s break it down : &quot; &quot; photo &quot; &quot; means from the sun , and a catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction ."
So what photocatalysis is doing is it &apos;s just speeding up this solar disinfection process .
"But unfortunately , there are several disadvantages to the way photocatalytic SODIS is currently deployed ."
"See , what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles and they coat the inside with this photocatalytic coating ."
But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide are actually commonly used in sunscreens to block UV radiation .
The composite combines titanium dioxide with cement .
"For example , you could create a rod that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families ."
You can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to purify larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time .
"You know , I didn &apos;t have access to a sophisticated laboratory ."
"See , water isn &apos;t just the universal solvent ."
Water is a universal human right .
"And this summer , I founded Catalyst for World Water , a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future .
"He had a vision . When he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision ."
"He &apos;d spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . ( Laughter ) It was my first week in federal prison , and I was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on TV ."
"In fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate ."
"Now , 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different jargon , but the business concepts that they talked about weren &apos;t unlike those that you &apos;d learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton : promotional incentives , you never charge a first-time user , focus-grouping new product launches , territorial expansion ."
But they didn &apos;t spend a lot of time reliving the glory days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive ."
It &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
"Contrary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , taxpayers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in prison . You &apos;ve got to pay for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
"First , everything &apos;s marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d pay on the street , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I unloaded trucks . That was my full-time job , unloading trucks at a food warehouse , for $ 5.25 , not an hour , but per month ."
So how do you survive ?
"Well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles ."
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency .
You charge another inmate to clean his cell .
"There &apos;s sort of illegal hustles , like you run a barbershop out of your cell ."
There &apos;s pretty illegal hustles : You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell .
"And there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be ."
You want a cigarette in prison ? Three to five dollars .
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head ? Three hundred bucks .
You want a dirty magazine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity ."
"Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people &apos;s hair with toenail clippers , or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses ."
"But there &apos;s no training , nothing to prepare them for that , no rehabilitation at all in prison , no one to help them write a business plan , figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises , no access to the Internet , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background ."
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years .
"Look , I lied to the Feds . I lost a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn &apos;t have to waste any more of their life than they already had ."
So I hope that you &apos;ll think about helping in some way .
"The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
All they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hustles .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important factor for success .
"And it was found close to here , Stanford ."
"And he would tell the child , a four-year-old kid , &quot; &quot; Johnny , I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this marshmallow is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes for something that they like , is equivalent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you coffee in two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Exact equivalent ."
So what happened when the professor left the room ?
As soon as the door closed ...
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
"Five seconds , 10 seconds , 40 seconds , 50 seconds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
( Laughter ) Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...
Would look at it .
Put it back .
They would walk around . They would play with their skirts and pants .
"That child already , at four , understood the most important principle for success , which is the ability to delay gratification ."
"15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19 .
They were happy . They had their plans .
"They had good relationships with the teachers , students ."
They were doing fine .
"A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble ."
They did not make it to university .
They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"Hispanic kids , two out of three ate the marshmallow ; one out of three did not ."
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the marshmallow .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register ."
But she will be successful .
And this applies for everything . Even in sales .
"If the sales person says , &quot; &quot; Wait a second ."
I end with — the Koreans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over Korea .
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
"And we need to learn that principle here in the States , because we have a big debt ."
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , jeez , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !"
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smart enough .
And there &apos;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
I want to discuss with you this afternoon why you &apos;re going to fail to have a great career .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m an economist .
I do dismal .
"End of the day , it &apos;s ready for dismal remarks ."
I only want to talk to those of you who want a great career .
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career .
"You &apos;re going to fail , too ."
"( Laughter ) Because — goodness , you &apos;re all cheery about failing . ( Laughter )"
"Canadian group , undoubtedly . ( Laughter )"
"Those trying to have good careers are going to fail , because , really , good jobs are now disappearing ."
"First reason is that no matter how many times people tell you , &quot; &quot; If you want a great career , you have to pursue your passion , you have to pursue your dreams , you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life , &quot; &quot; you hear it again and again , and then you decide not to do it ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter how many times you download Steven J. &apos; s Stanford commencement address , you still look at it and decide not to do it ."
I &apos;m not quite sure why you decide not to do it .
You &apos;re too lazy to do it . It &apos;s too hard .
They are Steven J.
I &apos;m not a genius .
"When I was five , I thought I was a genius , but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And now I know I am completely competent . &quot;"
"Now , you see , if this was 1950 , being completely competent — that would have given you a great career ."
But guess what ?
"This is almost 2012 , and saying to the world , &quot; I am totally , completely competent , &quot; is damning yourself with the faintest of praise ."
"And then , of course , another excuse : &quot; &quot; Well , I would do this , I would do this , but , but — well , after all , I &apos;m not weird ."
A little strange .
Hmm ? Hmm ? Okay ?
"You know , a fine line between madness and genius ."
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not weird . I &apos;ve read Steven J. &apos; s biography .
Oh my goodness — I &apos;m not that person . I am nice .
I am normal .
"I &apos;m a nice , normal person , and nice , normal people — don &apos;t have passion . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Ah , but I still want a great career ."
"I &apos;m not prepared to pursue my passion , so I know what I &apos;m going to do , because I have a solution ."
I have a strategy .
It &apos;s the one Mommy and Daddy told me about .
"Mommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard , I &apos;d have a good career ."
"So , if you work hard and have a good career , if you work really , really , really hard , you &apos;ll have a great career ."
"Doesn &apos;t that , like , mathematically make sense ? &quot; &quot; Hmm . Not ."
"You know what ? Here &apos;s a little secret : You want to work ? You want to work really , really , really hard ?"
You know what ? You &apos;ll succeed .
"The world will give you the opportunity to work really , really , really , really hard ."
"But , are you so sure that that &apos;s going to give you a great career , when all the evidence is to the contrary ?"
So let &apos;s deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion .
"You actually understand that you really had better do it , never mind the excuses ."
You found something you &apos;re interested in .
&quot; I have an interest ! I have an interest ! &quot;
You tell me .
"You say , &quot; &quot; I have an interest ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s wonderful !"
"And what are you trying to tell me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I have an interest . &quot;"
"I say , &quot; &quot; Do you have passion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an interest , &quot; &quot; you say ."
&quot; Your interest is compared to what ? &quot;
"&quot; Well , I &apos;m interested in this . &quot;"
&quot; And what about the rest of humanity &apos;s activities ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not interested in them . &quot;
"&quot; You &apos;ve looked at them all , have you ? &quot;"
&quot; No . Not exactly . &quot;
Passion is your greatest love .
Passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent .
"Passion , interest — it &apos;s not the same thing ."
"Are you really going to go to your sweetie and say , &quot; Marry me ! You &apos;re interesting . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Won &apos;t happen .
"Won &apos;t happen , and you will die alone ."
"( Laughter ) What you want , what you want , what you want , is passion ."
It is beyond interest .
"You need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might grab you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love , in comparison to all the other things that interest you , and that &apos;s what passion is ."
"I have a friend , proposed to his sweetie ."
He was an economically rational person .
"He said to his sweetie , &quot; &quot; Let us marry ."
"Let us merge our interests . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Yes , he did ."
"&quot; &quot; I love you truly , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I love you deeply ."
I love you more than any other woman I &apos;ve ever encountered .
"I love you more than Mary , Jane , Susie , Penelope , Ingrid , Gertrude , Gretel — I was on a German exchange program then ."
I love you more than — &quot; &quot; All right .
"After he got over his surprise at being , you know , turned down , he concluded he &apos;d had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person ."
"Although , he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed , it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part ."
( Laughter ) But the point stands .
"You must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny , or are you afraid of the word &quot; &quot; destiny &quot; &quot; ?"
Does the word &quot; &quot; destiny &quot; &quot; scare you ?
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
"And if you don &apos;t find the highest expression of your talent , if you settle for &quot; &quot; interesting , &quot; &quot; what the hell ever that means , do you know what will happen at the end of your long life ?"
One was a great career .
One was a missed opportunity .
"But then , there are some of you who , in spite of all these excuses , you will find , you will find your passion ."
And you &apos;ll still fail .
"You &apos;re going to fail , because — because you &apos;re not going to do it , because you will have invented a new excuse , any excuse to fail to take action , and this excuse , I &apos;ve heard so many times : &quot; &quot; Yes , I would pursue a great career , but , I value human relationships — ( Laughter ) more than accomplishment ."
I want to be a great friend .
I want to be a great spouse .
"I want to be a great parent , and I will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What do you want me to say ?"
"Now , do you really want me to say now , tell you , &quot; Really , I swear I don &apos;t kick children . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Look at the worldview you &apos;ve given yourself .
You &apos;re a hero no matter what .
I don &apos;t hate children . I don &apos;t kick them .
"( Laughter ) Course , I had to tell him the building was for adults only , and to get out ."
"He mumbled something about his mother , and I told him she &apos;d probably find him outside anyway ."
"Last time I saw him , he was on the stairs crying ."
( Laughter ) What a wimp . ( Laughter )
But what do you mean ? That &apos;s what you expect me to say .
Do you really think it &apos;s appropriate that you should actually take children and use them as a shield ?
"You know what will happen someday , you ideal parent , you ?"
"The kid will come to you someday and say , &quot; &quot; I know what I want to be ."
I know what I &apos;m going to do with my life . &quot; &quot; You are so happy .
"It &apos;s the conversation a parent wants to hear , because your kid &apos;s good in math , and you know you &apos;re going to like what comes next ."
"Says your kid , &quot; &quot; I have decided I want to be a magician ."
I want to perform magic tricks on the stage . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And what do you say ?
"You say , you say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s risky , kid ."
"Might fail , kid . Don &apos;t make a lot of money at that , kid ."
"I don &apos;t know , kid , you should think about that again , kid ."
And what are you going to say ?
You know what you &apos;re going to say ?
"&quot; &quot; Look kid . I had a dream once , too , but — But — &quot; &quot; So how are you going to finish the sentence with your &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; ?"
"&quot; But . I had a dream too , once , kid , but I was afraid to pursue it . &quot;"
"Or are you going to tell him this : &quot; &quot; I had a dream once , kid ."
"But then , you were born . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Do you really want to use your family , do you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid , and see your jailers ?"
"There was something you could have said to your kid , when he or she said , &quot; &quot; I have a dream . &quot; &quot; You could have said — looked the kid in the face and said , &quot; &quot; Go for it , kid !"
"Just like I did . &quot; &quot; But you won &apos;t be able to say that , because you didn &apos;t ."
So you can &apos;t .
( Laughter ) And so the sins of the parents are visited on the poor children .
Why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion ?
You know why .
"In your heart of hearts , you know why , and I &apos;m being deadly serious ."
You know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships .
It is because you are — you know what you are .
You &apos;re afraid to pursue your passion .
You &apos;re afraid to look ridiculous .
You &apos;re afraid to try .
You &apos;re afraid you may fail .
"Great friend , great spouse , great parent , great career ."
Is that not a package ? Is that not who you are ?
How can you be one without the other ?
But you &apos;re afraid .
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to have a great career .
"Unless — &quot; &quot; unless , &quot; &quot; that most evocative of all English words — &quot; unless . &quot;"
"But the &quot; &quot; unless &quot; &quot; word is also attached to that other , most terrifying phrase , &quot; If only I had ... &quot; &quot; If only I had ... &quot;"
"If you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain ,"
it will hurt a lot .
"So , those are the many reasons why you are going to fail to have a great career ."
Unless — Unless .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Martin Luther King did not say , &quot; I have a nightmare , &quot; when he inspired the civil rights movements ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dream . &quot; &quot; And I have a dream ."
"I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times , nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic ."
"I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; &quot; The Road . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead ."
"And just a father and son trying to survive , walking along the road ."
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future .
"For too long , we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have focused on the worst-case scenario .
We have focused on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solutions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to grab people &apos;s attention ."
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism .
"It &apos;s part of the fight and flight mechanism , that when an animal is frightened — think of a deer ."
"A deer freezes very , very still , poised to run away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .
People are freezing and running away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is , an economic definition of what progress is — that somehow , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the stock market , whether that &apos;s with GDP and economic growth , that somehow life is going to get better ."
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear — that more is better .
"Come on . In the Western world , we have enough ."
"Maybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations .
"In fact , the architect of our national accounting system , Simon Kuznets , in the 1930s , said that , &quot; &quot; A nation &apos;s welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff ."
"And indeed , this is probably historical , and it had its time ."
"In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff ."
"And indeed , we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe , and we had to rebuild it afterwards ."
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce .
"But as early as 1968 , this visionary man , Robert Kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been ."
"And he finished his talk with the phrase , that , &quot; &quot; The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot; &quot; How crazy is that ? That our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?"
"I believe , if Kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile ."
"He &apos;d be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being ."
"And actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global survey .
"It &apos;s asking people , what do they want ."
"And unsurprisingly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their families , their children , their communities ."
"Okay , they think money is slightly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not nearly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not nearly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
We want to be healthy and live a full life .
These seem to be natural human aspirations .
Why are statisticians not measuring these ?
"Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my adult life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environmental limits ."
"And we created , at the organization that I work for , the New Economics Foundation , something we call the Happy Planet Index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that shows that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens ."
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
"But we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resources we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ultimate scarce resource , the one planet that we share ."
And economics is very interested in scarcity .
"When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency ."
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use .
It is an efficiency measure .
"And probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph ."
"Running horizontally along the graph , is &quot; &quot; ecological footprint , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet ."
More is bad .
"Running vertically upwards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-being of nations ."
It &apos;s like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
It &apos;s like quality and quantity of life in nations .
"And the yellow dot there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a huge array of nations around that global average ."
"To the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.S.A. , other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually ."
"Conversely , at the bottom left of the graph , are countries that are not producing much well-being — typically , sub-Saharan Africa ."
"In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there ."
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"Malaria , HIV / AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , yellow triangles , that are doing better than global average , that are heading up towards the top left of the graph ."
This is an aspirational graph .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the earth ."
They &apos;re Latin American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven &apos;t been to .
Maybe some of you have .
Costa Rica .
Costa Rica — average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .
That is longer than in the USA .
"They are , according to the latest Gallup world poll , the happiest nation on the planet — than anybody ; more than Switzerland and Denmark ."
They are the happiest place .
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in &#91; the &#93; Western world — a quarter of the resources .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in Costa Rica ?
We can look at some of the data .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021 .
They abolished the army in 1949 — 1949 .
And they invested in social programs — health and education .
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world .
"And they have that Latin vibe , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connectedness .
"( Laughter ) The challenge is , that possibly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be North American , might not be Western European ."
It might be Latin American .
"And the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pull countries from the bottom , and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph ."
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the richest countries , the OECD group , we do ."
"And this is the trend in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the trend in ecological footprint ."
"And so in strict happy-planet methodology , we &apos;ve become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human lifetime away .
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .
This is not the very distant future .
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not business as usual ."
That is changing our business .
"That is changing the way we create our organizations , we do our government policy and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to carry on increasing well-being ."
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce .
"None of us , I think , want human progress to stop ."
I think we want it to carry on .
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want quality of life to keep increasing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to engage them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"Human beings are very motivated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Why is it , on the radio news every evening , I hear the FTSE 100 , the Dow Jones , the dollar pound ratio — I don &apos;t even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Why don &apos;t I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday , or American used yesterday ?"
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ?
That &apos;s how you create a collective goal .
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it .
"And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level , they might create national accounts of well-being ."
"At a business level , you might look at the well-being of your employees , which we know is really linked to creativity , which is linked to innovation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues ."
"At a personal level , we need these nudges too ."
"Maybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need reminders ."
"In the U.K. , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier ?
"We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago , a big program called the Foresight program — lots and lots of people — involved lots of experts — everything evidence based — a huge tome ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the secrets of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life ."
"Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
Keep building them .
The second one is be active .
"The fastest way out of a bad mood : step outside , go for a walk , turn the radio on and dance ."
Being active is great for our positive mood .
The third one is take notice .
"How aware are you of things going on around the world , the seasons changing , people around you ?"
Do you notice what &apos;s bubbling up for you and trying to emerge ?
"Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being ."
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important — learning throughout the whole life course .
"Older people who keep learning and are curious , they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be formal learning ; it &apos;s not knowledge based .
It &apos;s more curiosity .
"It can be learning to cook a new dish , picking up an instrument you forgot as a child ."
Keep learning .
"And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities , but give ."
"Our generosity , our altruism , our compassion , are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put onto these handy postcards , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the earth ."
They don &apos;t have any carbon content .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth .
"Now , Martin Luther King , on the eve of his death , gave an incredible speech ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I know there are challenges ahead , there may be trouble ahead , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care ."
"I have been to the mountain top , and I have seen the Promised Land . &quot; &quot; Now , he was a preacher , but I believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the Promised Land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want ."
"And not only that , we need to create a Great Transition to get there , and we need to pave that great transition with good things ."
Human beings want to be happy .
Pave them with the five ways .
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them — something like the Happy Planet Index .
"And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the earth ."

"To understand the business of mythology and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do , you have to hear a story of Ganesha , the elephant-headed god who is the scribe of storytellers , and his brother , the athletic warlord of the gods , Kartikeya ."
"The two brothers one day decided to go on a race , three times around the world ."
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans .
"He went around once , he went around twice , he went around thrice ."
"But his brother , Ganesha , simply walked around his parents once , twice , thrice , and said , &quot; &quot; I won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How come ? &quot; &quot; said Kartikeya ."
"And Ganesha said , &quot; &quot; You went around &apos; the world . &apos; I went around &apos; my world . &apos; &quot; &quot; What matters more ?"
"If you understand the difference between &apos; the world &apos; and &apos; my world , &apos; you understand the difference between logos and mythos ."
"&apos;The world &apos; is objective , logical , universal , factual , scientific ."
&apos;My world &apos; is subjective .
It &apos;s emotional . It &apos;s personal .
"It &apos;s perceptions , thoughts , feelings , dreams ."
It is the belief system that we carry .
It &apos;s the myth that we live in .
"&apos;The world &apos; tells us how the world functions , how the sun rises , how we are born ."
"&apos;My world &apos; tells us why the sun rises , why we were born ."
Every culture is trying to understand itself : &quot; Why do we exist ? &quot;
"And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life , its own customized version of mythology ."
"Culture is a reaction to nature , and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories , symbols and rituals , which are always indifferent to rationality ."
"And so , when you study it , you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world ."
Different people see things differently — different viewpoints .
"There is my world and there is your world , and my world is always better than your world , because my world , you see , is rational and yours is superstition ."
Yours is faith .
Yours is illogical .
This is the root of the clash of civilizations .
"It took place , once , in 326 B.C."
"on the banks of a river called the Indus , now in Pakistan ."
This river lends itself to India &apos;s name .
India . Indus .
"Alexander , a young Macedonian , met there what he called a &quot; &quot; gymnosophist , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; the naked , wise man . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know who he was ."
"Perhaps he was a Jain monk , like Bahubali over here , the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore ."
"Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock , staring at the sky and the sun and the moon ."
"Alexander asked , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ? &quot; &quot; and the gymnosophist answered , &quot; I &apos;m experiencing nothingness . &quot;"
"Then the gymnosophist asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;"
"and Alexander said , &quot; &quot; I am conquering the world . &quot; &quot; And they both laughed ."
Each one thought that the other was a fool .
"The gymnosophist said , &quot; &quot; Why is he conquering the world ?"
"It &apos;s pointless . &quot; &quot; And Alexander thought , &quot; &quot; Why is he sitting around , doing nothing ?"
"What a waste of a life . &quot; &quot; To understand this difference in viewpoints , we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander — his myth , and the mythology that constructed it ."
"Alexander &apos;s mother , his parents , his teacher Aristotle told him the story of Homer &apos;s &quot; &quot; Iliad . &quot; &quot; They told him of a great hero called Achilles , who , when he participated in battle , victory was assured , but when he withdrew from the battle , defeat was inevitable ."
"&quot; &quot; Achilles was a man who could shape history , a man of destiny , and this is what you should be , Alexander . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what he heard ."
&quot; &quot; What should you not be ?
"You should not be Sisyphus , who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night ."
"Don &apos;t live a life which is monotonous , mediocre , meaningless ."
"Be spectacular ! — like the Greek heroes , like Jason , who went across the sea with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece ."
"Be spectacular like Theseus , who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur ."
"When you play in a race , win ! — because when you win , the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods . &quot; &quot; Because , you see , the Greeks believed you live only once , and when you die , you have to cross the River Styx ."
"And if you have lived an extraordinary life , you will be welcomed to Elysium , or what the French call &quot; &quot; Champs-Élysées &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — the heaven of the heroes ."
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .
He heard a very different story .
"He heard of a man called Bharat , after whom India is called Bhārata ."
Bharat also conquered the world .
And then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru .
"And he wanted to hoist his flag to say , &quot; I was here first . &quot;"
"But when he reached the mountain peak , he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him , each one claiming &quot; &quot; &apos; I was here first &apos; ..."
"that &apos;s what I thought until I came here . &quot; &quot; And suddenly , in this canvas of infinity , Bharat felt insignificant ."
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist .
"You see , he had heroes , like Ram — Raghupati Ram and Krishna , Govinda Hari ."
But they were not two characters on two different adventures .
They were two lifetimes of the same hero .
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins .
"When Ram dies , Krishna is born ."
"When Krishna dies , eventually he will be back as Ram ."
"You see , the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead ."
But you don &apos;t cross it once .
You go to and fro endlessly .
It was called the Vaitarani .
You go again and again and again .
"Because , you see , nothing lasts forever in India , not even death ."
"And so , you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for 10 days ..."
And what do you do at the end of 10 days ?
You dunk it in the river .
Because it has to end .
"And next year , she will come back ."
"What goes around always comes around , and this rule applies not just to man , but also the gods ."
"You see , the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram , as Krishna ."
"Not only do they live infinite lives , but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all ."
&quot; Groundhog Day . &quot;
( Laughter ) Two different mythologies .
Which is right ?
"Two different mythologies , two different ways of looking at the world ."
"One linear , one cyclical ."
One believes this is the one and only life .
The other believes this is one of many lives .
"And so , the denominator of Alexander &apos;s life was one ."
"So , the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements ."
The denominator of the gymnosophist &apos;s life was infinity .
"So , no matter what he did , it was always zero ."
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero .
Who knows ?
And that brings us to the mythology of business .
"If Alexander &apos;s belief influenced his behavior , if the gymnosophist &apos;s belief influences his behavior , then it was bound to influence the business they were in ."
"You see , what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves ?"
"And if you look at cultures around the world , all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business ."
Take a look .
"If you live only once , in one-life cultures around the world , you will see an obsession with binary logic , absolute truth , standardization , absoluteness , linear patterns in design ."
"But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives , you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic , with opinion , with contextual thinking , with everything is relative , sort of — ( Laughter ) mostly . ( Laughter )"
"You look at art . Look at the ballerina , how linear she is in her performance ."
"And then look at the Indian classical dancer , the Kuchipudi dancer , the Bharatanatyam dancer , curvaceous ."
( Laughter ) And then look at business .
"Standard business model : vision , mission , values , processes ."
"Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land , with the commandments held by the leader ."
"And if you comply , you will go to heaven ."
But in India there is no &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; promised land .
"There are many promised lands , depending on your station in society , depending on your stage of life ."
"You see , businesses are not run as institutions , by the idiosyncrasies of individuals ."
It &apos;s always about taste .
It &apos;s always about my taste .
"You see , Indian music , for example , does not have the concept of harmony ."
There is no orchestra conductor .
"There is one performer standing there , and everybody follows ."
And you can never replicate that performance twice .
It is not about documentation and contract .
It &apos;s about conversation and faith .
"It &apos;s not about compliance . It &apos;s about setting , getting the job done , by bending or breaking the rules — just look at your Indian people around here , you &apos;ll see them smile ; they know what it is ."
"( Laughter ) And then look at people who have done business in India , you &apos;ll see the exasperation on their faces . ( Laughter )"
"( Applause ) You see , this is what India is today . The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view ."
"So , it &apos;s rapidly changing , highly diverse , chaotic , ambiguous , unpredictable ."
And people are okay with it .
And then globalization is taking place .
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in .
Which is rooted in one-life culture .
"And a clash is going to take place , like on the banks of the Indus ."
It is bound to happen .
I have personally experienced it . I &apos;m trained as a medical doctor .
I did not want to study surgery . Don &apos;t ask me why .
I love mythology too much .
I wanted to learn mythology . But there is nowhere you can study .
"So , I had to teach it to myself ."
"And mythology does not pay , well , until now ."
"( Laughter ) So , I had to take up a job . And I worked in the pharma industry ."
And I worked in the healthcare industry .
"And I worked as a marketing guy , and a sales guy , and a knowledge guy , and a content guy , and a training guy ."
"I even was a business consultant , doing strategies and tactics ."
"And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues , when they were dealing with India ."
Example : Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals .
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly .
( Laughter ) How do you parameterize &quot; &quot; mostly &quot; &quot; ?
How do you put it in a nice little software ? You can &apos;t .
I would give my viewpoints to people .
"But nobody was interested in listening to it , you see , until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group ."
"You see , he has established the largest retail chain , called Big Bazaar ."
"And there are more than 200 formats , across 50 cities and towns of India ."
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets .
"And he knew very intuitively , that best practices , developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India ."
He knew that institutional thinking doesn &apos;t work in India . Individual thinking does .
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India .
"So , he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer , and said , &quot; All I want to do is align belief . &quot;"
Sounds so simple .
But belief is not measurable .
You can &apos;t measure it . You can &apos;t manage it .
"So , how do you construct belief ?"
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness .
"Even if you are Indian , it is not very explicit , it is not very obvious ."
"So , I tried to work on the standard model of culture , which is , develop stories , symbols and rituals ."
And I will share one of the rituals with you .
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan .
Hindus don &apos;t have the concept of commandments .
"So , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life ."
"So , you &apos;re not really sure how you stand in front of God ."
"So , when you go to the temple , all you seek is an audience with God ."
You want to see God .
"And you want God to see you , and hence the gods have very large eyes , large unblinking eyes , sometimes made of silver , so they look at you ."
"Because you don &apos;t know whether you &apos;re right or wrong , and so all you seek is divine empathy ."
"&quot; Just know where I came from , why I did the Jugaad . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Why did I do the setting , why I don &apos;t care for the processes . Just understand me , please . &quot; &quot; And based on this , we created a ritual for leaders ."
"After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store , we blindfold him , we surround him with the stakeholders , the customer , his family , his team , his boss ."
"You read out his KRA , his KPI , you give him the keys , and then you remove the blindfold ."
"And invariably , you see a tear , because the penny has dropped ."
"He realizes that to succeed , he does not have to be a &quot; &quot; professional , &quot; &quot; he does not have to cut out his emotions , he has to include all these people in his world to succeed , to make them happy , to make the boss happy , to make everyone happy ."
"The customer is happy , because the customer is God ."
"That sensitivity is what we need . Once this belief enters , behavior will happen , business will happen ."
And it has .
"So , then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist ."
"And everybody asks me , &quot; &quot; Which is the better way , this way or that way ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very dangerous question , because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence ."
"So , I will not answer the question ."
"What I will give you is an Indian answer , the Indian head-shake ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Depending on the context , depending on the outcome , choose your paradigm ."
"You see , because both the paradigms are human constructions ."
"They are cultural creations , not natural phenomena ."
"And so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : Understand that you live in the subjective truth , and so does he ."
Understand it .
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular .
You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth .
Who sees it all ?
Varuna has but a thousand eyes .
"Indra , a hundred ."
"You and I , only two ."
Thank you . Namaste .
( Applause )
"But on the right , you have the students with the growth mindset , the idea that abilities can be developed ."
Are we raising them for now instead of yet ?
How can we build that bridge to yet ?
There are other ways to reward yet .
"In this game , students were rewarded for effort , strategy and progress ."
So the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids .
That &apos;s when they &apos;re getting smarter .
Do you remember the story of Odysseus and the Sirens from high school or junior high school ?
"There was this hero , Odysseus , who &apos;s heading back home after the Trojan War ."
"And he &apos;s standing on the deck of his ship , he &apos;s talking to his first mate , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow , we will sail past those rocks , and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens ."
"And these women sing an enchanting song , a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die . &quot; &quot; Now you would expect , given that , that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens , but instead Odysseus says , &quot; &quot; I want to hear that song ."
"And so what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men — stay with me — so that you can &apos;t hear the song , and then I &apos;m going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected . &quot; &quot; So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song ."
"And I &apos;d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have rehearsed it a few times ."
"Odysseus would have said , &quot; &quot; Okay , let &apos;s do a dry run ."
"You tie me to the mast , and I &apos;m going to beg and plead ."
"And no matter what I say , you cannot untie me from the mast ."
"All right , so tie me to the mast . &quot; &quot; And the first mate takes a rope and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot ."
"And Odysseus does his best job playacting and says , &quot; &quot; Untie me . Untie me ."
I want to hear that song . Untie me . &quot; &quot; And the first mate wisely resists and doesn &apos;t untie Odysseus .
"And then Odysseus says , &quot; &quot; I see that you can get it ."
"All right , untie me now and we &apos;ll get some dinner . &quot; &quot; And the first mate hesitates ."
"He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Is this still the rehearsal , or should I untie him ? &quot; &quot; And the first mate thinks , &quot; Well , I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end . &quot;"
"So he unties Odysseus , and Odysseus flips out ."
"He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You idiot . You moron ."
"If you do that tomorrow , I &apos;ll be dead , you &apos;ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead ."
Now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot; &quot; He throws the first mate to the ground .
"This repeats itself through the night — rehearsal , tying to the mast , conning his way out of it , beating the poor first mate up mercilessly ."
Hilarity ensues .
Tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device .
A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don &apos;t do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
Because there &apos;s two heads inside one person when you think about it .
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation .
"There is first , the present self ."
This is like Odysseus when he &apos;s hearing the song .
He just wants to get to the front row .
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification .
"But then there &apos;s this other self , the future self ."
This is Odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife Penelope outside of Ithaca — the other one .
So why do we need commitment devices ?
"Well resisting temptation is hard , as the 19th century English economist Nassau William Senior said , &quot; &quot; To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power , or to seek distant rather than immediate results , are among the most painful exertions of the human will . &quot; &quot; If you set goals for yourself and you &apos;re like a lot of other people , you probably realize it &apos;s not that your goals are physically impossible that &apos;s keeping you from achieving them , it &apos;s that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them ."
It &apos;s physically possible to lose weight .
It &apos;s physically possible to exercise more .
But resisting temptation is hard .
The other reason that it &apos;s difficult to resist temptation is because it &apos;s an unequal battle between the present self and the future self .
"I mean , let &apos;s face it , the present self is present ."
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
"It has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth ."
And the future self is not even around .
It &apos;s off in the future . It &apos;s weak .
It doesn &apos;t even have a lawyer present .
There &apos;s nobody to stick up for the future self .
And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
"So there &apos;s this battle between the two selves that &apos;s being fought , and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two ."
Now I &apos;m a big fan of commitment devices actually .
"Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one , but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won &apos;t eat it or unplugging your Internet connection so you can use your computer ."
I was creating commitment devices of my own long before I knew what they were .
"So when I was a starving post-doc at Columbia University , I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career ."
I had to write five pages a day towards papers or I would have to give up five dollars .
"And when you try to execute these commitment devices , you realize the devil is really in the details ."
Because it &apos;s not that easy to get rid of five dollars .
"I mean , you can &apos;t burn it ; that &apos;s illegal ."
"And I thought , well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that ."
"But then I thought , oh , I &apos;m sending myself mixed messages ."
"Because not writing is bad , but giving to charity is good ."
So then I would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift .
"And then I kind of flipped that around and thought , well I could give it to the neo-Nazis ."
"But then I was like , that &apos;s more bad than writing is good , and so that wouldn &apos;t work ."
"So ultimately , I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway ."
"Sometimes a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it ."
"On average , it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that I would regret ."
( Laughter ) Such it is with commitment devices .
"But despite my like for them , there &apos;s two nagging concerns that I &apos;ve always had about commitment devices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself ."
"So the first is , when you &apos;ve got one of these devices going , such as this contract to write everyday or pay , it &apos;s just a constant reminder that you have no self-control ."
"You &apos;re just telling yourself , &quot; &quot; Without you , commitment device , I am nothing , I have no self-discipline . &quot; &quot; And then when you &apos;re ever in a situation where you don &apos;t have a commitment device in place — like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , that person &apos;s offering me a doughnut , and I have no defense mechanism , &quot; &quot; — you just eat it ."
So I don &apos;t like the way that they take the power away from you .
"I think self-discipline is something , it &apos;s like a muscle ."
"The more you exercise it , the stronger it gets ."
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
"You say , &quot; &quot; Well , of course I can &apos;t write today , because I &apos;m giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews , and then I &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then I &apos;ll be drunk after that ."
"And so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot; &quot; So in effect , you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person ."
"You &apos;re putting yourself , you &apos;re binding yourself , and you &apos;re weaseling your way out of it , and then you &apos;re beating yourself up afterwards ."
So I &apos;ve been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people &apos;s relationship to the future self without using commitment devices .
"In particular , I &apos;m interested in the relationship to the future financial self ."
And this is a timely issue .
I &apos;m talking about the topic of saving .
Now saving is a classic two selves problem .
The present self does not want to save at all .
It wants to consume .
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
So this is a timely problem .
We look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .
"At the same time , the Retirement Risk Index , the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement , has been increasing ."
"And we &apos;re at a situation now where for every three baby boomers , the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they &apos;re in retirement ."
So what can we do about this ?
"There &apos;s a philosopher , Derek Parfit , who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I."
"He said that , &quot; &quot; We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination . &quot; &quot; That is to say , we somehow might not believe that we &apos;re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we &apos;re going to get old some day ."
"On the one hand , it sounds ridiculous ."
"Of course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old ."
But aren &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
"So my coauthors and I have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people &apos;s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future ."
And I &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
The first is called the distribution builder .
It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future .
"Each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement ."
Being up at the top means that you &apos;re enjoying a high income in retirement .
Being down at the bottom means that you &apos;re struggling to make ends meet .
"When you make an investment , what you &apos;re really saying is , &quot; &quot; I accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth . &quot; &quot; Now you can try to move your outcomes around ."
"You can try to manipulate your fate , like this person is doing , but it costs you something to do it ."
It means that you have to save more today .
"Once you find an investment that you &apos;re happy with , what people do is they click &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one ."
It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out .
"At the end , there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement ."
"Yes , this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement ."
They &apos;re making more money while retired than they were making while they were working .
"If you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy — just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before ."
"However , had you ended up on the very bottom , it might have given you a slight sense of dread and / or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement ."
"By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome , people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future ."
"Now people are motivated through emotions , but different people find different things motivating ."
"This is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers ."
"So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes , I show people what those outcomes will get you , in particular apartments that you can afford if you &apos;re retiring on 3,000 , 2,500 , 2,000 dollars per month and so on ."
"As you move down the ladder of apartments , you see that they get worse and worse ."
Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student .
"And as you get to the very bottom , you &apos;re faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don &apos;t save anything for retirement , you won &apos;t be able to afford any housing at all ."
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the Internet .
"The last thing I &apos;ll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that I created with Hal Hershfield , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , Bill Sharpe ."
And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .
"So what we do is we take pictures of people — in this case , college-age people — and we use software to age them and show these people what they &apos;ll look like when they &apos;re 60 , 70 , 80 years old ."
And we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior .
So this is one of our experiments .
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left .
He &apos;s given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate .
"As he moves his savings rate down , it means that he &apos;s saving zero when it &apos;s all the way here at the left ."
"You can see his current annual income — this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today — is quite high , 91 percent , but his retirement income is quite low ."
He &apos;s going to retire on 44 percent of what he earned while he was working .
"If he saves the maximum legal amount , his retirement income goes up , but he &apos;s unhappy because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today ."
Other conditions show people the future self .
"And from the future self &apos;s point of view , everything is in reverse ."
"If you save very little , the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income ."
"Whereas if the present self saves a lot , the future self is delighted , where the income is close up near 100 percent ."
"To bring this to a wider audience , I &apos;ve been working with Hal and Allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine , in which you not only get to see yourself in the future , but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth ."
"So for instance , here is somebody using the tool ."
And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
"The younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing ."
The older face is miserable .
"And slowly , slowly we &apos;re bringing it up to a moderate savings rate ."
And then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
The younger face is getting unhappy .
The older face is quite pleased with the decision .
We &apos;re going to see if this has an effect on what people do .
"And what &apos;s nice about it is it &apos;s not something that biasing people actually , because as one face smiles , the other face frowns ."
"It &apos;s not telling you which way to put the slider , it &apos;s just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self ."
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being .
And that &apos;s something that &apos;s easy to forget .
This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older .
"There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke , if they get too much exposure to the sun , if they gain weight and so on ."
"And what &apos;s good is , unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith , you don &apos;t have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality ."
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
"This is actually a picture of Hal , my coauthor ."
You might recognize him from the previous demos .
"And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look ."
"Hal is here , so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image ."
And I &apos;ll close it there .
"On behalf of Hal and myself , I wish all the best to your present and future selves ."
Thank you .

A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever .
"And today , after briefly describing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery , namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth , the Milky Way and other distant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse ."
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
"I mean , most of us were raised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with forethought , as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was holding her and I said , &quot; &quot; Sophia , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Daddy , universe or multiverse ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But barring such an anomalous upbringing , it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours , most with fundamentally different features , that would rightly be called universes of their own ."
"And yet , speculative though the idea surely is , I aim to convince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll offer a solution to that mystery ."
"It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story ."
"Finally , in part three , I &apos;m going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together ."
"Okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it &apos;s expanding ."
Now this was revolutionary .
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The expansion must be slowing down ."
"That , much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward , the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing .
"And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the surprise : They found that the expansion is not slowing down .
"Instead they found that it &apos;s speeding up , going faster and faster ."
That &apos;s like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster .
"Now if you saw an apple do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
"Similarly , the astronomers &apos; results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize , but they raised an analogous question ."
What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together ."
"But in Einstein &apos;s theory of gravity , his general theory of relativity , gravity can also push things apart ."
"How ? Well according to Einstein &apos;s math , if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy , sort of like a uniform , invisible mist , then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive , repulsive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observations ."
"Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it smokey white here so you can see it — its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other , driving expansion to speed up , not slow down ."
And this explanation represents great progress .
But I promised you a mystery here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"Expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small ."
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
"We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might wonder , should you care ?"
"Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue , a technical detail of interest to experts , but of no relevance to anybody else ."
"Well it surely is a technical detail , but some details really matter ."
"Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality , and this peculiar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes — an idea that naturally emerges from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory ."
So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
"First off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an approach to realize Einstein &apos;s dream of a unified theory of physics , a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe ."
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
"It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely , at first you &apos;ll find molecules and then you &apos;ll find atoms and subatomic particles ."
"But the theory says that if you could probe smaller , much smaller than we can with existing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibrating filament of energy , a little tiny vibrating string ."
"And just like the strings on a violin , they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes ."
"These little fundamental strings , when they vibrate in different patterns , they produce different kinds of particles — so electrons , quarks , neutrinos , photons , all other particles would be united into a single framework , as they would all arise from vibrating strings ."
"It &apos;s a compelling picture , a kind of cosmic symphony , where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little , tiny strings can play ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has internal inconsistencies , unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the usual three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as height , width and depth ."
"But string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them ."
"But even though the dimensions are hidden , they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate ."
"And in string theory , vibration determines everything ."
"So particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to calculate these features , calculate the amount of dark energy ."
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math .
"Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe ."
But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes .
"From five , the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands — A large , but still manageable , collection to analyze , since after all , graduate students need something to do ."
"But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions , until today ."
The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some researchers lost heart , concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions , each giving rise to different physical features , string theory would never make definitive , testable predictions ."
"But others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
"Each is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions ."
And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery : the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results .
"Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measured would take on a wholly different character .
"In this context , the laws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
"Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies , the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes ."
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"Mystery solved , multiverse found ."
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe .
"But the point is , if the feature you &apos;re observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided ."
An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number — why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth .
"And he worked for decades trying to explain this number , but he never succeeded , and we know why ."
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
"So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number , 93 million miles , well that is simply wrongheaded ."
"Instead the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance , instead of any of the other possibilities ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exist .
"And those planets that are much farther away from the star , well they &apos;re so cold that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
"And when it comes to planets and their distances , this clearly is the right kind of reasoning ."
"The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain , it may also be the right kind of reasoning ."
"One key difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes ."
"So to pull it all together , we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes ."
"And that takes me to my final part , part three ."
Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang .
"You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward ."
But there &apos;s a little secret .
"The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important , the Bang ."
"It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang , but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself ."
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory .
"It &apos;s called inflationary cosmology , which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space ."
"The fuel is based on something called a quantum field , but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it &apos;s virtually impossible to use it all up , which means in the inflationary theory , the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event ."
"Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang , but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes ."
"And now , when we meld this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
The different shapes yield different physical features .
"And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical features , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider .
"One big remaining question , of course , is , could we ever confirm the existence of other universes ?"
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
"Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed ."
"Going further , if there are other universes , the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide ."
"And if our universe got hit by another , that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect ."
"And so exotic as this picture is , it may one day be grounded in observations , establishing the existence of other universes ."
I &apos;ll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies ."
"But because the expansion is speeding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of technological limitations , but because of the laws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies emit , even traveling at the fastest speed , the speed of light , will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us ."
"So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static , inky , black stillness ."
And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit — a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies ."
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
"Or would they believe in the black , static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal ?"
I suspect the latter .
Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
"Because today &apos;s astronomers , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , have captured a handful of starkly informative photons — a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit ."
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law .
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Brian , thank you ."
"The range of ideas you &apos;ve just spoken about are dizzying , exhilarating , incredible ."
"How do you think of where cosmology is now , in a sort of historical side ?"
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
BG : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain deep , critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves ."
"So from that perspective , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"On the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."
"We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches ."
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
"So on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve gotten , but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future ."
CA : You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
"Thank you . Thank you , Brian . ( BG : My pleasure . ) ( Applause )"
"In the year 1919 , a virtually unknown German mathematician , named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and , in some ways , a very bizarre idea ."
He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of .
"That is in addition to left , right , back , forth and up , down , Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea , sometimes that &apos;s all it is — bold and bizarre , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , however — although we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
To begin we need a little bit of back story . Go to 1907 .
"This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the grand , pervasive force of gravity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved ."
"Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s that works well , describes the motion of planets , the motion of the moon and so forth , the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees , hitting people on the head ."
All of that could be described using Newton &apos;s work .
"But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story , because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity , he &apos;d been unable to figure out how it really works ."
"How is it that the Sun , 93 million miles away , &#91; that &#93; somehow it affects the motion of the Earth ?"
How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence ?
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself — to figure out how gravity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a substrate of all there is .
"Einstein said space is nice and flat , if there &apos;s no matter present ."
"But if there is matter in the environment , such as the Sun , it causes the fabric of space to warp , to curve ."
And that communicates the force of gravity .
Even the Earth warps space around it .
Now look at the Moon .
"The Moon is kept in orbit , according to these ideas , because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence ."
We go to a full-frame view of this .
The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that &apos;s curved because of the Sun &apos;s presence .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
"Now , this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations ."
It really works . It describes the data .
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world .
And that is what got Kaluza thinking .
"He , like Einstein , was in search of what we call a unified theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to describe all of nature &apos;s forces from one set of ideas , one set of principles , one master equation , if you will ."
"So Kaluza said to himself , Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more precise ."
"Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force , which was , at that time , known as the electromagnetic force — we know of others today , but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about ."
"You know , the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth ."
"So Kaluza says , maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves ."
That raised a question : warps and curves in what ?
"Einstein had already used up space and time , warps and curves , to describe gravity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to warp or curve .
"So Kaluza said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to describe one more force , maybe I need one more dimension ."
"So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space , not three , and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension . Now here &apos;s the thing : when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions , not three , he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions — those were for gravity — but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension ."
"And when he looked at that equation , it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force ."
Amazing — it just popped out .
"He was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming , &quot; &quot; Victory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the unified theory ."
"Now clearly , Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a treatise on swimming — ( Laughter ) — then dove into the ocean ."
This is a man who would risk his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded , two questions immediately arise from his observation ."
"Number one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in detail , when you try to apply it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was answered in 1926 by a fellow named Oskar Klein ."
"He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties — there might be big , easy-to-see dimensions , but there might also be tiny , curled-up dimensions , curled up so small , even though they &apos;re all around us , that we don &apos;t see them ."
Let me show you that one visually .
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light ."
"It &apos;s in Manhattan . You &apos;re in Central Park — it &apos;s kind of irrelevant — but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint , but you and I all know that it does have some thickness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around — little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions — the long dimension , but also this clockwise , counter-clockwise direction ."
And I hope you appreciate this .
It took so long to get these ants to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see , but there might be additional dimensions curled up , sort of like the circular part of that cable , so small that they have so far remained invisible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"So , if we take a look , say , at space itself — I can only show , of course , two dimensions on a screen ."
"Some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that &apos;s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have additional curled up dimensions — here is a little shape of a circle — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around , you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the grid part — but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment ."
"But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
Now that &apos;s an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see .
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time , and , in detail , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In detail , for instance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 40s , certainly by the &apos; 50s , this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away ."
Until something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called superstring theory , as you were indicating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study superstring theory , we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Superstring theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivisible , uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a familiar object , just a candle in a holder , and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents .
"So deep inside — we all know , you go sufficiently far down , you have atoms ."
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons .
Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks .
That is where conventional ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
"Deep inside any of these particles , there is something else ."
This something else is this dancing filament of energy .
"It looks like a vibrating string — that &apos;s where the idea , string theory comes from ."
"And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns , these can also vibrate in different patterns ."
They don &apos;t produce different musical notes .
"Rather , they produce the different particles making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are correct , this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies ."
The different frequencies produce the different particles .
The different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us .
"And there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravitons , are all built up from one entity ."
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a unified theory .
Now here is the catch .
"When you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six ."
"Finally , you can study the equations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time ."
"It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein — that our world , when appropriately described , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , OK , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really tightly curled up , yeah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them either . That is true ."
"One of the other predictions of string theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predictions of string theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the remaining time , I &apos;d like to tell you two features of them ."
"First is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics , theoretical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe ."
"These are numbers like the mass of the particles , like electrons and quarks , the strength of gravity , the strength of the electromagnetic force — a list of about 20 numbers that have been measured with incredible precision , but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do ."
"Now , does string theory offer an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other values than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t exist ."
This is a deep question .
"Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form , when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers — if I had 20 dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers , almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimension , as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein ."
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very rich , intertwined geometry ."
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape — name isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape , interesting structure ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales ."
"When you swing your hand , you &apos;d be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physical implication , though , relevant to those 20 numbers ?"
"Consider this . If you look at the instrument , a French horn , notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument ."
"Now in string theory , all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate ."
"So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument , strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving ."
So let me bring some strings into the story .
"And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to calculate the allowed notes , the allowed vibrational patterns ."
"And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns , we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second issue that I want to finish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly ?"
"Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?"
"And we think — and this is , I think , very exciting — that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions ."
"Here &apos;s how it goes . In CERN , Geneva , Switzerland , a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider ."
"It &apos;s a machine that will send particles around a tunnel , opposite directions , near the speed of light ."
"Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other , so there &apos;s a head-on collision ."
"The hope is that if the collision has enough energy , it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions , forcing it to enter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the collision , compare it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the collision than before , this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away ."
"And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea visually .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton — that &apos;s the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You slam them together .
"You slam them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment bears fruit , if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we began , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"And to me this is a really remarkable story , and a remarkable opportunity . Going back to Newton with absolute space — didn &apos;t provide anything but an arena , a stage in which the events of the universe take place ."
"Einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can warp and curve — that &apos;s what gravity is ."
"And now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .
Amazing possibility .
Thank you very much .

Let me ask you all a question .
OK . And how about this minibus ?
All right .
So she didn &apos;t grow up hearing a lot about nuclear weapons .
"For Jasmine , a fallout shelter is an app in the Android store ."
We have solid evidence that terrorists are trying to get ahold of them .
"But at that time , Russian President Boris Yeltsin came within five minutes of launching a full-scale retaliatory nuclear attack against the United States ."
"So , most of the world &apos;s nuclear nations have committed to getting rid of these weapons of mass destruction ."
He gave us a challenge that would have been incredible just a few years earlier .
"And with that challenge , he inspired scientists and marketers , astronauts and schoolteachers ."
He gave us a vision .
"And apparently , Nikita Khrushchev , the Soviet Premier , agreed ."
"But before that cooperation could be realized , Kennedy was assassinated , and that part of the vision was deferred ."
But the promise of joint innovation between these two nuclear superpowers wasn &apos;t totally extinguished .
"They called it , &quot; &quot; Megatons to Megawatts . &quot; &quot; So the result is that for over 20 years , our two nations had a program that meant that one in 10 lightbulbs in the United States was essentially fueled by former Russian warheads ."
"So , together these two nations did something truly audacious ."
"But the good news is , the global community has the chance to do something just as audacious today ."
"To get rid of nuclear weapons and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them , some experts tell me would take 30 years ."
"It would take a renaissance of sorts , the kinds of innovation that , for better or worse , underpinned both the Manhattan Project , which gave rise to nuclear weapons , and the Megatons to Megawatts program ."
It would take design constraints .
"These are fundamental to creativity , things like a platform for international collaboration ; a date certain , which is a forcing mechanism ; and a positive vision that inspires action ."
It would take us to 2045 .
"Now , 2045 happens to be the 100th anniversary of the birth of nuclear weapons in the New Mexico desert ."
But it &apos;s also an important date for another reason .
"It &apos;s predicted to be the advent of the singularity , a new moment in human development , where the lines between artificial intelligence and human intelligence blur , where computing and consciousness become almost indistinguishable and advanced technologies help us solve the 21st century &apos;s greatest problems : hunger , energy , poverty , ushering in an era of abundance ."
And we all get to go to space on our way to becoming a multi-planetary species .
"Now , the people who really believe this vision are the first to say they don &apos;t yet know precisely how we &apos;re going to get there ."
But the values behind their vision and the willingness to ask &quot; &quot; How might we ? &quot; &quot; have inspired a generation of innovators .
"They &apos;re working backward from the outcomes they want , using the creative problem-solving methods of collaborative design ."
They &apos;re busting through obstacles .
They &apos;re redefining what we all consider possible .
"It has to be about strategies for mutually assured prosperity or , at the very least , mutually assured survival ."
"Now , every day , I get to meet people who are real pioneers in the field of nuclear threats ."
It &apos;s as if there &apos;s a taboo .
"No problem of human destiny , he said , is beyond human beings ."
I believe that .
"And I bet a lot of you here believe that , too ."
And I know Generation Possible believes it .
So it &apos;s time to commit to a date .
Let &apos;s end the nuclear weapons chapter on the 100th anniversary of its inception .
"After all , by 2045 , we will have held billions of people hostage to the threat of nuclear annihilation ."
"Surely , 100 years will have been enough ."
"Surely , if ever there was a global moon shot worth supporting , this is it ."
"Now , in the face of real threats — for instance , North Korea &apos;s recent nuclear weapons tests , which fly in the face of sanctions — reasonable people disagree about whether we should maintain some number of nuclear weapons to deter aggression ."
But the question is : What &apos;s the magic number ?
Is it a thousand ?
Is it a hundred ? Ten ?
And then we have to ask : Who should be responsible for them ?
"I think we can agree , however , that having 15,000 of them represents a greater global threat to Jasmine &apos;s generation than a promise ."
"It &apos;s time we pledge our resources as leaders across the spectrum to work on this old problem in new ways , to ask , &quot; &quot; How might we ? &quot; &quot; How might we make good on a promise of greater security for Jasmine &apos;s generation in a world beyond nuclear weapons ?"
I truly hope you will join us .

"I am a chef and a food policy guy , but I come from a whole family of teachers ."
My sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago .
My father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade .
My aunt and uncle were professors .
My cousins all teach .
"Everybody in my family , basically , teaches except for me ."
They taught me that the only way to get the right answers is to ask the right questions .
So what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children ?
"There &apos;s obviously many important questions , but I think the following is a good place to start : What do we think the connection is between a child &apos;s growing mind and their growing body ?"
What can we expect our kids to learn if their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients ?
What can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally going hungry ?
"And with all the resources that we are pouring into schools , we should stop and ask ourselves : Are we really setting our kids up for success ?"
"Now , a few years ago , I was a judge on a cooking competition called &quot; &quot; Chopped . &quot; &quot; Four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes ."
Except for this episode — it was a very special one .
"Now , I know it &apos;s been a long time since most of you have had a school lunch , and we &apos;ve made a lot of progress on nutrition , but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias ."
But the dish that I will never forget was cooked by a woman named Cheryl Barbara .
She cooked this delicious pasta .
"It was delicious , like , restaurant-quality good , except — she basically just threw the quinoa , pretty much uncooked , into the dish ."
"It was a strange choice , and it was super crunchy ."
"( Laughter ) So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing that you &apos;re supposed to do , and I asked her why she did that ."
"Cheryl responded , &quot; &quot; Well , first , I don &apos;t know what quinoa is . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; But I do know that it &apos;s a Monday , and that in my school , at High School in the Community , I always cook pasta . &quot; &quot; See , Cheryl explained that for many of her kids , there were no meals on the weekends ."
No meals on Saturday .
"No meals on Sunday , either ."
So she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew her children would eat .
"Something that would stick to their ribs , she said ."
Something that would fill them up .
"Cheryl talked about how , by the time Monday came , her kids &apos; hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn &apos;t even begin to think about learning ."
Food was the only thing on their mind .
The only thing .
"And unfortunately , the stats — they tell the same story ."
"So , let &apos;s put this into the context of a child ."
Meet Allison .
"She &apos;s 12 years old , she &apos;s smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up ."
"Her chances of getting a nutritious meal , one with fruit and milk , one lower in sugar and salt , dramatically increase ."
Allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid .
She &apos;ll have to visit the nurse less .
She &apos;ll have lower levels of anxiety and depression .
She &apos;ll have better behavior .
"She &apos;ll have better attendance , and she &apos;ll show up on time more often ."
Why ?
"Well , because there &apos;s a good meal waiting for her at school ."
"Overall , Allison is in much better health than the average school kid ."
So what about that kid who doesn &apos;t have a nutritious breakfast waiting for him ?
He &apos;s also 12 . He &apos;s a wonderful kid .
He wants to be a doctor .
"By the time Tommy is in kindergarten , he &apos;s already underperforming in math ."
"By the time he &apos;s in third grade , he &apos;s got lower math and reading scores ."
"By the time he &apos;s 11 , it &apos;s more likely that Tommy will have to have repeated a grade ."
So how widespread is this problem ?
"Well , unfortunately , it &apos;s pervasive ."
"In this city alone , in New York City , 474,000 kids under the age of 18 face hunger every year ."
It &apos;s crazy .
"On the other hand , diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country , by far ."
And fully a third of the kids that we &apos;ve been talking about tonight are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime .
"Now , what &apos;s hard to put together but is true is that , many times , these are the same children ."
So they fill up on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities and that their families can afford .
"But we should be able to solve this problem , right ?"
We know what the answers are .
"This program has been incredibly successful , because it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast ."
And that was the barrier of stigma .
"See , schools serve breakfast before school , and it was only available for the poor kids ."
So everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help .
"Now , all kids , no matter how much or how little their parents make , have a lot of pride ."
So what happened ?
"Well , the schools that have implemented this program saw an increase in math and reading scores by 17.5 percent . 17.5 percent ."
"And research shows that when kids have a consistent , nutritious breakfast ,"
their chances of graduating increase by 20 percent . 20 percent .
"When we give our kids the nourishment they need ,"
"we give them the chance to thrive , both in the classroom and beyond ."
"Now , you don &apos;t have to trust me on this , but you should talk to Donna Martin ."
I love Donna Martin .
"Donna Martin is the school nutrition director at Burke County in Waynesboro , Georgia ."
"Burke County is one of the poorest districts in the fifth-poorest state in the country , and about 100 percent of Donna &apos;s students live at or below the poverty line ."
"A few years ago , Donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming , and overhaul her nutrition standards ."
She improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains .
She served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids .
And she implemented a dinner program .
Why ?
"Well , many of her kids didn &apos;t have dinner when they went home ."
So how did they respond ?
"Well , the kids loved the food ."
"They loved the better nutrition , and they loved not being hungry ."
But Donna &apos;s biggest supporter came from an unexpected place .
"His name from Eric Parker , and he was the head football coach for the Burke County Bears ."
"Now , Coach Parker had coached mediocre teams for years ."
The Bears often ended in the middle of the pack — a big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states in the Union .
"( Laughter ) And Coach Parker , he credited that championship to Donna Martin ."
"When we give our kids the basic nourishment , they &apos;re going to thrive ."
It &apos;s on all of us .
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point .
What I &apos;ve laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face .
"If we focus on the simple goal of properly nourishing ourselves , we could see a world that is more stable and secure ; we could dramatically improve our economic productivity ; we could transform our health care and we could go a long way in ensuring that the Earth can provide for generations to come ."
Food is that place where our collective efforts can have the greatest impact .
So we have to ask ourselves : What is the right question ?
What would be the impact ?
"Cheryl Barbara , Donna Martin , Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears — I think they know the answer ."
Thank you guys so very much .

"Michelangelo had this elegant way of describing it when he said , &quot; &quot; Every block of stone has a statue inside of it , and it &apos;s the task of the sculptor to discover it . &quot; &quot; But what if he worked in the opposite direction ?"
I know that &apos;s an absurd notion .
It &apos;s probably impossible .
The only way you get a statue from a pile of dust is if the statue built itself — if somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together to form the statue .
"I don &apos;t build with stone , I build with nanomaterials ."
"They &apos;re these just impossibly small , fascinating little objects ."
There were scientific breakthroughs happening all the time .
"The conferences were buzzing , there was tons of money pouring in from funding agencies ."
We were trying to make blazing fast computers using nanomaterials .
The same thing that makes them so interesting — their small size — also makes them impossible to work with .
It &apos;s literally like trying to build a statue out of a pile of dust .
And we just don &apos;t have the tools that are small enough to work with them .
"But even if we did , it wouldn &apos;t really matter , because we couldn &apos;t one by one place millions of particles together to build a technology ."
"So because of that , all of the promise and all of the excitement has remained just that : promise and excitement ."
We &apos;ve built entire economies on this idea .
It &apos;s exponential .
And we owe it to ourselves to keep this progress going .
"We want to say the same thing 10 , 20 , 30 years from now : look what we &apos;ve done over the last 30 years ."
Yet we know this progress may not last forever .
"So if we want to keep this party going , we have to do what we &apos;ve always been able to do , and that is to innovate ."
They are just like they sound .
"And the science tells us if we could employ them in computing , we could see up to a ten times improvement in performance ."
It &apos;s like skipping through several technology generations in just one step .
So there we have it .
"The science is screaming at us , &quot; This is what you should be doing to solve your problem . &quot;"
"So , all right , let &apos;s get started , let &apos;s do this ."
But you just run right back into that double-edged sword .
This &quot; &quot; ideal solution &quot; &quot; contains a material that &apos;s impossible to work with .
I &apos;d have to arrange billions of them just to make one single computer chip .
"It &apos;s that same conundrum , it &apos;s like this undying problem ."
"What are we not doing that needs to be done ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like in &quot; &quot; The Godfather , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"When Fredo betrays his brother Michael , we all know what needs to be done ."
( Laughter ) But Michael — he puts it off .
"Fine , I get it ."
"Their mother &apos;s still alive , it would make her upset ."
"We just said , &quot; What &apos;s the Fredo in our problem ? &quot;"
"We have to find a way , somehow , to compel , to convince billions of these particles to assemble themselves into the technology ."
We can &apos;t do it for them . They have to do it for themselves .
"And it &apos;s the hard way , and this is not trivial , but in this case , it &apos;s the only way ."
"Now , as it turns out , this is not that alien of a problem ."
We just don &apos;t build anything this way .
People don &apos;t build anything this way .
But if you look around — and there &apos;s examples everywhere — Mother Nature builds everything this way .
Everything is built from the bottom up .
"You can go to the beach , you &apos;ll find these simple organisms that use proteins — basically molecules — to template what is essentially sand , just plucking it from the sea and building these extraordinary architectures with extreme diversity ."
She &apos;s been there for hundreds of millions of years .
We &apos;re the ones that are late to the party .
"So we decided that we &apos;re going to use the same tool that nature uses , and that &apos;s chemistry ."
Chemistry is the missing tool .
"We &apos;ve developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust , into the pile of nanoparticles , and pulls out exactly the ones we need ."
"Now , computing is just one example ."
"It &apos;s the one that I &apos;m interested in , that my group is really invested in , but there are others in renewable energy , in medicine , in structural materials , where the science is going to tell you to move towards the nano ."
That &apos;s where the biggest benefit is .
And they will need chemistry . That &apos;s the point .
"The beauty of science is that once you develop these new tools , they &apos;re out there ."
Thank you so much for your time . I appreciate it .

"We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly , and in many of the places where it counts the most , women are , in fact , taking control of everything ."
"In my mother &apos;s day , she didn &apos;t go to college ."
Not a lot of women did .
"And now , for every two men who get a college degree , three women will do the same ."
"Women , for the first time this year , became the majority of the American workforce ."
"And they &apos;re starting to dominate lots of professions — doctors , lawyers , bankers , accountants ."
"Over 50 percent of managers are women these days , and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade , all but two of them are dominated by women ."
"So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture — what our romantic comedies look like , what our marriages look like , what our dating lives look like , and our new set of superheroes ."
"For a long time , this is the image of American manhood that dominated — tough , rugged , in control of his own environment ."
"A few years ago , the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen , who is a parody of American manhood , and that &apos;s what we have in our commercials today ."
The phrase &quot; &quot; first-born son &quot; &quot; is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me .
"In American fertility clinics , 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys ."
"And in places where you wouldn &apos;t think , such as South Korea , India and China , the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little , and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons ."
"If you think about this , if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots , you can see the evidence everywhere ."
"You can see it in college graduation patterns , in job projections , in our marriage statistics , you can see it in the Icelandic elections , which you &apos;ll hear about later , and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference , that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women ."
Certainly this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had great progress with women .
The &apos; 20s and the &apos; 60s also come to mind .
"But the difference is that , back then , it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires , whereas this time , it &apos;s not about passion , and it &apos;s not about any kind of movement ."
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in .
"The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &apos;s why I talk about the &quot; &quot; end of men . &quot; &quot; Now all you men out there , this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes , because the point is that this is happening to all of us ."
I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love .
"And this is why I like to talk about this , because if we don &apos;t acknowledge it , then the transition will be pretty painful ."
"But if we do take account of it , then I think it will go much more smoothly ."
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago .
"I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else , and I started to notice a distinct pattern — that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women ."
"And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called &quot; &quot; Stiffed : The Betrayal of the American Man , &quot; &quot; in which she described how hard the recession had hit men , and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession ."
And I realized that two things were different this time around .
The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men — that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy .
"And second , that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men , but it was also about what was happening to women ."
And now look at this second set of slides .
These are headlines about what &apos;s been going on with women in the next few years .
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago .
"Women , a majority of the workplace ."
And labor statistics : women take up most managerial jobs .
This second set of headlines — you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift .
And look at that last headline — young women earning more than young men .
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm .
They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future .
"And they expected that it would be young families , or young men , just like it had always been ."
"But in fact , they found something very surprising ."
"It was young , single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood ."
"And so they decided , because they were intrigued by this finding , to do a nationwide survey ."
"So they spread out all the census data , and what they found , the guy described to me as a shocker , which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities , women , young women , were making more money than young men ."
So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them .
"Now , I &apos;ve just laid out the picture for you , but I still haven &apos;t explained to you why this is happening ."
"And in a moment , I &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;ll see on this graph — it begins in 1973 , just before women start flooding the workforce , and it brings us up to our current day ."
And basically what you &apos;ll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy .
Now what does that mean ?
"It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill , high-wage jobs and low-skill , low-wage jobs — and that the middle , the middle-skill jobs , and the middle-earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy ."
This has been going on for 40 years now .
But this process is affecting men very differently than it &apos;s affecting women .
"You &apos;ll see the women in red , and you &apos;ll see the men in blue ."
"You &apos;ll watch them both drop out of the middle class , but see what happens to women and see what happens to men ."
There we go .
So watch that . You see them both drop out of the middle class .
Watch what happens to the women . Watch what happens to the men .
"The men sort of stagnate there , while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs ."
So what &apos;s that about ?
"It looks like women got some power boost on a video game , or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high ."
"But of course , it &apos;s not about that ."
What it &apos;s about is that the economy has changed a lot .
"We used to have a manufacturing economy , which was about building goods and products , and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy ."
"Those two economies require very different skills , and as it happens , women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been ."
"It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn &apos;t have a college degree , but you had a specific set of skills , and with the help of a union , you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life ."
But that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
"This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength , which is what &apos;s helped men along all these years ."
What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills .
"You basically need intelligence , you need an ability to sit still and focus , to communicate openly , to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be , and those are things that women do extremely well , as we &apos;re seeing ."
"If you look at management theory these days , it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton , right ?"
You would be issuing orders from above .
You would be very hierarchical .
You would tell everyone below you what to do .
But that &apos;s not what an ideal leader is like now .
"If you read management books now , a leader is somebody who can foster creativity , who can get his — get the employees — see , I still say &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; — who can get the employees to talk to each other , who can basically build teams and get them to be creative ."
And those are all things that women do very well .
"And then on top of that , that &apos;s created a kind of cascading effect ."
"Women enter the workplace at the top , and then at the working class , all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home ."
"So that &apos;s childcare , elder care and food preparation ."
"So those are all the jobs that are growing , and those are jobs that women tend to do ."
"Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work , middle-aged , former steelworker guy to watch their children at home , and that would be good for the men , but that hasn &apos;t quite happened yet ."
"To see what &apos;s going to happen , you can &apos;t just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce ."
And here the story is fairly simple .
Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men .
Why ? This is a real mystery .
"People have asked men , why don &apos;t they just go back to college , to community college , say , and retool themselves , learn a new set of skills ?"
Well it turns out that they &apos;re just very uncomfortable doing that .
"They &apos;re used to thinking of themselves as providers , and they can &apos;t seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college ."
So for some reason men just don &apos;t end up going back to college .
And what &apos;s even more disturbing is what &apos;s happening with younger boys .
"There &apos;s been about a decade of research about what people are calling the &quot; &quot; boy crisis . &quot; &quot; Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys , for whatever reason , are doing worse in school than very young girls , and people have theories about that ."
"Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum , and little girls are better at that than little boys ?"
"Or that we require kids to sit still too much , and so boys initially feel like failures ?"
"And some people say it &apos;s because , in 9th grade , boys start dropping out of school ."
"Because I &apos;m writing a book about all this , I &apos;m still looking into it , so I don &apos;t have the answer ."
"But in the mean time , I &apos;m going to call on the worldwide education expert , who &apos;s my 10-year-old daughter , Noa , to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse ."
( Video ) Noa : The girls are obviously smarter .
I mean they have much larger vocabulary .
They learn much faster .
They are more controlled .
"On the board today for losing recess tomorrow , only boys ."
Hanna Rosin : And why is that ?
Noa : Why ? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely .
HR : So there you go .
This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City — working-class college .
"Certainly , when I was in college , I had certain expectations about my life — that my husband and I would both work , and that we would equally raise the children ."
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future .
"Basically , the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day , that their husband would maybe have a job , but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies ."
And this was kind of a shocker to me .
And then here &apos;s my favorite quote from one of the girls : &quot; Men are the new ball and chain . &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now you laugh , but that quote has kind of a sting to it , right ?"
"And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t reverse themselves without a lot of pain , and that &apos;s why I talk about us all going through this together ."
"The night after I talked to these college girls , I also went to a men &apos;s group in Kansas , and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier ."
"They were men who had been contractors , or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom , and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support ."
And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age .
"He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority , that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore , and they were not really the providers ."
So who were they ?
And this was very disheartening for them .
"And what he did was he wrote down on the board &quot; $ 85,000 , &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s her salary , &quot; &quot; and then he wrote down &quot; &quot; $ 12,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your salary ."
So who &apos;s the man now ? &quot; &quot; he asked them .
&quot; &quot; Who &apos;s the damn man ?
She &apos;s the man now . &quot; &quot; And that really sent a shudder through the room .
"And that &apos;s part of the reason I like to talk about this , because I think it can be pretty painful , and we really have to work through it ."
And the other reason it &apos;s kind of urgent is because it &apos;s not just happening in the U.S.
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
"In India , poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India ."
"In China , a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses , small businesses , faster than men ."
"And here &apos;s my favorite example , which is in South Korea ."
"Over several decades , South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about ."
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code .
"And if women failed to birth male children , they were basically treated like domestic servants ."
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child .
"But over the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the workforce ."
Now they &apos;ve been asking a question since 1985 : &quot; How strongly do you prefer a first-born son ? &quot;
And now look at the chart .
That &apos;s from 1985 to 2003 .
How much do you prefer a first-born son ?
So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture .
"Now because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing ."
"And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the &quot; &quot; omega males &quot; &quot; popping up , who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can &apos;t find a job ."
And they come up in lots of different forms .
So we have the perpetual adolescent .
We have the charmless misanthrope .
Then we have our Bud Light guy who &apos;s the happy couch potato .
"And then here &apos;s a shocker : even America &apos;s most sexiest man alive , the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie ."
"And then on the female side , you have the opposite , in which you have these crazy superhero women ."
You &apos;ve got Lady Gaga .
"You &apos;ve got our new James Bond , who &apos;s Angelina Jolie ."
"And it &apos;s not just for the young , right ?"
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days .
And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we &apos;ve got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal .
"So for a long time in the economic sphere , we &apos;ve lived with the term &quot; &quot; glass ceiling . &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;ve never really liked this term ."
"For one thing , it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another , because the men are these devious tricksters up there who &apos;ve put up this glass ceiling ."
"And we &apos;re always below the glass ceiling , the women ."
"And we have a lot of skill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?"
"And also , &quot; &quot; shattering the glass ceiling &quot; &quot; is a terrible phrase ."
What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
"So the image that I like to think of , instead of glass ceiling , is the high bridge ."
"It &apos;s definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge , but it &apos;s also pretty exhilarating , because it &apos;s beautiful up there , and you &apos;re looking out on a beautiful view ."
And the great thing is there &apos;s no trick like with the glass ceiling .
There &apos;s no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables .
There &apos;s no hole in the middle that you &apos;re going to fall through .
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you .
You can bring your husband along .
"You can bring your friends , or your colleagues , or your babysitter to walk along with you ."
"And husbands can drag their wives across , if their wives don &apos;t feel ready ."
"But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge , that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge , but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it ."
Thanks very much .

"At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we &apos;re going to become , and then when we become those people , we &apos;re not always thrilled with the decisions we made ."
So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get .
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry .
Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain .
On and on and on .
"The question is , as a psychologist , that fascinates me is , why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret ?"
"Now , I think one of the reasons — I &apos;ll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time ."
"Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan , that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl ?
Is it teenage years ? Is it middle age ?
"Is it old age ? The answer , it turns out , for most people , is now , wherever now happens to be ."
"What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion , an illusion that history , our personal history , has just come to an end , that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives ."
Let me give you some data to back up that claim .
Here &apos;s three values .
So how does it do so ?
"Well , we asked thousands of people ."
"We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years , and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years ."
"And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis , because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people , say , 18 years old , to the reports of people who were 28 , and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan ."
Here &apos;s what we found .
"At every age , from 18 to 68 in our data set , people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years ."
We call this the &quot; &quot; end of history &quot; &quot; illusion .
"To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect , you can connect these two lines , and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do ."
Now it &apos;s not just values . It &apos;s all sorts of other things .
"For example , personality ."
"Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality : neuroticism , openness to experience , agreeableness , extraversion , and conscientiousness ."
"Again , we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years , and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years , and what we found , well , you &apos;re going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over , because once again the rate of change does slow as we age , but at every age , people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade ."
And it isn &apos;t just ephemeral things like values and personality .
"You can ask people about their likes and dislikes , their basic preferences ."
"For example , name your best friend , your favorite kind of vacation , what &apos;s your favorite hobby , what &apos;s your favorite kind of music ."
People can name these things .
"We ask half of them to tell us , &quot; Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years ? &quot;"
"and half of them to tell us , &quot; Did that change over the last 10 years ? &quot;"
Does any of this matter ?
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn &apos;t have consequences ?
"No , it matters quite a bit , and I &apos;ll give you an example of why ."
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways .
Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago .
I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
"And yet , when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today , they say only 80 dollars ."
"Now , in a perfectly rational world , these should be the same number , but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability ."
"Why does this happen ? We &apos;re not entirely sure , but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining ."
"Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago , but we find it hard to imagine who we &apos;re going to be , and then we mistakenly think that because it &apos;s hard to imagine , it &apos;s not likely to happen ."
"Sorry , when people say &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re usually talking about their own lack of imagination , and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they &apos;re describing ."
"The bottom line is , time is a powerful force ."
It transforms our preferences .
It reshapes our values .
It alters our personalities .
"We seem to appreciate this fact , but only in retrospect ."
Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade .
It &apos;s a watershed on the timeline .
It &apos;s the moment at which we finally become ourselves .
Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they &apos;re finished .
"The person you are right now is as transient , as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you &apos;ve ever been ."
The one constant in our life is change .
Thank you .

We &apos;ve been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising .
"So I &apos;ll try and do that , but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows ."
"And the first one , in fact , is something that has been known for most of recorded history , and that is , that the planet Earth , or the solar system , or our environment or whatever , is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution — or creation , as it used to be thought — and our present existence , and most important , our future survival ."
"Nowadays , this idea has a dramatic name : Spaceship Earth ."
"And the idea there is that outside the spaceship , the universe is implacably hostile , and inside is all we have , all we depend on , and we only get the one chance : if we mess up our spaceship , we &apos;ve got nowhere else to go ."
"Now , the second thing that everyone already knows is that , contrary to what was believed for most of human history , human beings are not , in fact , the hub of existence ."
"As Stephen Hawking famously said , we &apos;re just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that &apos;s in orbit around a typical star , which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy , and so on ."
"Now , the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we &apos;re at a very un-typical place , uniquely suited and so on , and the second one is saying that we &apos;re at a typical place ."
But that doesn &apos;t prevent them from both being completely false .
( Laughter ) And they are .
"So let me start with the second one : &quot; &quot; Typical . &quot; &quot; Well , is this a typical place ?"
"Well , let &apos;s look around , you know , look in a random direction , and we see a wall , and chemical scum — ( Laughter ) and that &apos;s not typical of the universe at all ."
"All you &apos;ve got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back , and you won &apos;t see any walls or chemical scum at all — all you see is a blue planet ."
"And if you go further than that , you &apos;ll see the Sun , the solar system and the stars and so on , but that &apos;s still not typical of the universe , because stars come in galaxies ."
"So let &apos;s go out further , till we &apos;re outside the galaxy , and look back , and yeah , there &apos;s the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us ."
"And at this point , we &apos;ve come 100,000 light-years from here ."
But we &apos;re still nowhere near a typical place in the universe .
"To get to a typical place , you &apos;ve got to go 1,000 times as far as that , into intergalactic space ."
"And so , what does that look like — &quot; &quot; typical ? &quot; &quot; What does a &quot; &quot; typical &quot; &quot; place in the universe look like ?"
"Well , at enormous expense , TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space ."
"Can we have the lights off , please , so we can see it ?"
"Well , not quite , not quite perfect ."
"You see , intergalactic space is completely dark , pitch dark ."
"It &apos;s so dark , that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you , and that star were to explode as a supernova , and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you , you still wouldn &apos;t be able to see even a glimmer ."
That &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
"And that &apos;s despite the fact that a supernova is so bright , so brilliant an event , that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years ."
"( Laughter ) And yet , from intergalactic space , it &apos;s so far away you wouldn &apos;t even see it ."
It &apos;s also very cold out there — less than three degrees above absolute zero .
And it &apos;s very empty .
The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create .
So that &apos;s how different a typical place is from this place .
And that is how un-typical this place is .
So can we have the lights back on please ? Thank you .
"Now , how do we know about an environment that &apos;s so far away and so different and so alien from anything we &apos;re used to ?"
"Well , the Earth — our environment , in the form of us — is creating knowledge ."
"Well , what does that mean ?"
"Well , look out even further than we &apos;ve just been — I mean from here , with a telescope — and you &apos;ll see things that look like stars , they &apos;re called quasars ."
"&quot; Quasars &quot; originally meant &quot; quasi-stellar object , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; things that look a bit like stars . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But they &apos;re not stars ."
And we know what they are .
"Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away , the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole ."
"Now , the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet ."
We couldn &apos;t survive for an instant in it .
Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets .
"( Laughter ) And yet , that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later , on the other side of the universe , some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain , above all — there &apos;s your reference — what was happening there , in reality ."
"Not just a superficial image of it , though it contains that as well , but an explanatory model , embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure ."
"Now , that is knowledge ."
"And if that weren &apos;t amazing enough , the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time ."
That is the growth of knowledge .
"So , the laws of physics have this special property , that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time ."
So we are a chemical scum that is different .
This chemical scum has universality .
"Its structure contains , with ever-increasing precision , the structure of everything ."
"This place , and not other places in the universe , is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality ."
"And so , far from being insignificant , the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen , is one of the most important things about the physical world ."
"Now how does the solar system — our environment , in the form of us — acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe ?"
"Well , one thing that &apos;s true about Stephen Hawking &apos;s remark — I mean , it is true , but it &apos;s the wrong emphasis ."
"One thing that &apos;s true about it is that it doesn &apos;t do it with any special physics , there &apos;s no special dispensation , no miracles involved ."
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance .
"One of them is matter , because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing ."
"Information processing is computation , computation requires a computer — there &apos;s no known way of making a computer without matter ."
"We also need energy to make the computer , and most important , to make the media , in effect , onto which we record the knowledge that we discover ."
"And then thirdly , less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge , of explanations , is evidence ."
"Now , our environment is inundated with evidence ."
"But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that , and will continue to fall for billions of years afterwards ."
And the same is true for all the other sciences .
"As far as we know , evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking , on our planet ."
Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy .
"Out in intergalactic space , those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply — as I said , it &apos;s empty , it &apos;s cold and it &apos;s dark out there ."
Or is it ?
"Now actually , that &apos;s just another parochial misconception ."
"( Laughter ) Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space , the same size as our home , the solar system ."
"Now that cube is very empty by human standards , but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter ."
"And a million tons is enough to make , say , a self-contained space station , on which there &apos;s a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge , and so on ."
"But the thing is , in a comprehensible universe , if something isn &apos;t forbidden by the laws of physics , then what could possibly prevent us from doing it , other than knowing how ?"
"In other words , it &apos;s a matter of knowledge , not resources ."
"If we could do that , we &apos;d automatically have an energy supply , because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor ."
And evidence ?
"Well , again , it &apos;s dark out there to human senses , but all you &apos;ve got to do is take a telescope , even one of present-day design , look out , and you &apos;ll see the same galaxies as we do from here ."
"And with a more powerful telescope , you &apos;ll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies , you &apos;ll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics ."
"And locally there you could build particle accelerators , and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry , and so on ."
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips — ( Laughter ) because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back .
"But I have to tell you — and sorry , Richard — but I never did like biology field trips much , ( Laughter ) and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years . ( Laughter )"
"So in fact , intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge ."
"Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are , if the knowledge of how to do so were present there ."
"So , we &apos;re not in a uniquely hospitable place ."
"If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations , then so is almost every other environment , so is the Earth ."
So is a polluted Earth .
"And the limiting factor , there and here , is not resources , because they &apos;re plentiful , but knowledge , which is scarce ."
Now this cosmic knowledge-based view may — and I think ought to — make us feel very special .
"But it should also make us feel vulnerable , because it means that without the specific knowledge that &apos;s needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe , we won &apos;t survive them ."
"All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away , and we &apos;ll all be dead !"
"Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things , from astrophysics , to scientific experiments gone wrong , and most importantly , to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction ."
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century .
I think he &apos;s going to talk about that later in the conference .
"Now , I don &apos;t think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in , but I do agree with him about this : We can survive and we can fail to survive ."
"But it depends not on chance , but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time ."
The danger is not at all unprecedented .
Species go extinct all the time .
Civilizations end .
The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history .
"And if we want to be the exception to that , then logically , our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others — namely , our special relationship with the laws of physics , our ability to create new explanations , new knowledge — to be a hub of existence ."
"Now , I &apos;m a physicist , but I &apos;m not the right kind of physicist ."
"In regard to global warming , I &apos;m just a layman ."
And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory .
"And according to that theory , it &apos;s already too late to avoid a disaster , because if it &apos;s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars , or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure ."
"And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem , merely to postpone it by a little ."
"It was probably already too late in the 1970s , when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age , in which billions would die ."
"Now , the lesson of that seems clear to me , and I don &apos;t know why it isn &apos;t informing public debate ."
It is that we can &apos;t always know .
"When we know of an impending disaster , and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself , then there &apos;s not going to be much argument , really ."
But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee .
"Hence , we need a stance of problem-fixing , not just problem-avoidance ."
"If you &apos;ve been punched on the nose , then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches ."
"( Laughter ) If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only , then it would achieve very little of either ."
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .
"It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature , and with plans to live at the higher temperature — and not at all costs , but efficiently and cheaply ."
"At the moment , these things are fringe research ; they &apos;re not central to the human effort to face this problem , or problems in general ."
"And with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right — not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely — is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival ."
"So take two stone tablets , and carve on them ."
"On one of them , carve : &quot; &quot; Problems are soluble . &quot; &quot; And on the other one , carve : &quot; &quot; Problems are inevitable . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
They need to be part of the pack .
"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use digital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TEDTalks ."
"Instead , I have progressed , and I am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA : this box ."
This box contains one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people ."
"In the developing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they lived away then .
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
"In the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families ."
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
"And in 1960 , all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this ."
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
"But in contrast to this , in the developing world , far away , the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day ."
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up .
"And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the West &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the Developing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the West ."
"A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here ."
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them ."
They are now buying cars .
"And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company , Geely , they acquired the Volvo company , and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; richer also &#93; have ."
"And their aspiration now is , of course , to buy a bicycle , and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any gap ."
"But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever ."
"But there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying — there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 ."
"I was in Shanghai recently , and I listened to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as Japan did ."
All the projections &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"&#91; But this second &#93; grows with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start flying .
"And these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically ."
"And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology — so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; among emerging economies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing ."
"So these &#91; poorest &#93; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the poorest &#93; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
The yellow on there is the Americas ; dark blue is Africa ; brown is Europe ; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
"Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big families , small families ."
The year is 1960 .
"And down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion Western world here — high child-survival , small families — and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"Can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?"
"They get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . Family size is decreasing ."
"&#91; When &#93; they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there &#91; to small families &#93; ."
"Look , Bangladesh catching up with India ."
"The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion ."
"Can you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; boxes I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation ."
And the population will double in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
"That &apos;s why investments by Gates Foundation , UNICEF and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world ."
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
Child survival is the new green .
It &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an optimist , neither am I a pessimist ."
"I &apos;m a very serious &quot; &quot; possibilist . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old West .
"Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him Bill — is transfixed by embarrassment , at staring at the thing there in the center ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush , which for Al Gore ?"
"And in this case , the stereotype corresponds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience .
"People low on it like things that are familiar , that are safe and dependable ."
"Once you understand this trait , you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee &apos;s , but not anybody that you know ."
( Laughter ) This trait also tells us a lot about politics .
This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join .
So here &apos;s the description of a group I found on the Web .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to raise your hand , whether you are liberal , left of center — on social issues , we &apos;re talking about , primarily — or conservative , and I &apos;ll give a third option , because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience ."
Please raise your hand high right now . OK .
Please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re libertarian .
"OK , about a — two dozen ."
And please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or conservative .
OK . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our goal is to understand the world , to seek a deeper understanding of the world , our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder ."
"Because when people all share values , when people all share morals , they become a team , and once you engage the psychology of teams , it shuts down open-minded thinking ."
"When the liberal team loses , as it did in 2004 , and as it almost did in 2000 , we comfort ourselves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team .
"We think they must be blinded by religion , or by simple stupidity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way , then my message to you is that you &apos;re trapped in a moral matrix , in a particular moral matrix ."
"I was going to ask you which one you picked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
What is morality and where does it come from ?
The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience ."
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The third foundation is in-group / loyalty .
You do find groups in the animal kingdom — you do find cooperative groups — but these groups are always either very small or they &apos;re all siblings .
"It &apos;s only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate , join together into groups , but in this case , groups that are united to fight other groups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of tribal living , of tribal psychology ."
( Laughter ) Sports is to war as pornography is to sex .
"We get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives ."
The fourth foundation is authority / respect .
Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species .
"It &apos;s based on more voluntary deference , and even elements of love , at times ."
The fifth foundation is purity / sanctity .
"This painting is called &quot; &quot; The Allegory Of Chastity , &quot; &quot; but purity &apos;s not just about suppressing female sexuality ."
"And so far , 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens ."
"They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board , but as you also see , liberals care about it a little more than conservatives — the line slopes down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
"Notice also that on all of these graphs , the slope is steeper on in-group , authority , purity ."
"Which shows that within any country , the disagreement isn &apos;t over harm and fairness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first panel , we see the moment of creation ."
"All is ordered , all is beautiful , all the people and animals are doing what they &apos;re supposed to be doing , where they &apos;re supposed to be ."
"But then , given the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing whatever he wants , with every aperture of every other person and every other animal ."
Some of you might recognize this as the &apos; 60s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 60s inevitably gives way to the &apos; 70s , where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more ."
"Of course , Bosch called this hell ."
"So this triptych , these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay ."
The truth of social entropy .
"On the first round , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they quickly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people aren &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a sucker . I &apos;m not going to cooperate . &quot; &quot; And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good , down to close to zero ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the trick — Fehr and Gachter said , on the seventh round , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New rule ."
Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon .
The Grand Canyon is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of rock , and then a lot of water and wind , and a lot of time , and you get the Grand Canyon ."
It &apos;s not that complicated .
"This is an absolute miracle , much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon ."
And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives .
This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained .
Think about yin and yang .
You find the same thing in Hinduism .
There are many high gods in Hinduism .
"Two of them are Vishnu , the preserver , and Shiva , the destroyer ."
This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body .
"You have the markings of Vishnu on the left , so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god ."
"You have the markings of Shiva on the right , Shiva &apos;s the liberal god . And they work together ."
"These two stanzas contain , I think , the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology ."
"From the Zen master Seng-ts &apos;an : &quot; &quot; If you want the truth to stand clear before you , never be for or against ."
"The struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot; &quot; Now unfortunately , it &apos;s a disease that has been caught by many of the world &apos;s leaders ."
"But before you feel superior to George Bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?"
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil ?
Can you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? Am I telling you to not strive ?
"Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts &apos;an and stop , stop with this struggle of for and against ?"
"No , absolutely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from Samantha Power , in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello , you can &apos;t just go charging in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thinks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people .
Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama — and it comes from his moral humility .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better ."
People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .

Is there anything unique about human beings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .
We &apos;re obsessed with morality as social creatures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I personally am obsessed with morality .
"It was all due to this woman , Sister Mary Marastela , also known as my mom ."
"As an altar boy , I breathed in a lot of incense , and I learned to say phrases in Latin , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s top-down morality applied to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some earthly basis for moral decisions ."
But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality . I want to know
if there was a moral molecule .
"After 10 years of experiments , I found it ."
Would you like to see it ? I brought some with me .
This little syringe contains the moral molecule .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals .
"In rodents , it was known to make mothers care for their offspring , and in some creatures , allowed for toleration of burrowmates ."
"But in humans , it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women , and is released by both sexes during sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colleagues .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; Paul , that is the world &apos;s stupidist idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a female molecule ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I countered , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s brains make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stupid idea ."
But it was testably stupid .
"In other words , I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
Turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"First of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule ."
"Baseline levels are near zero , without some stimulus to cause its release ."
"And when it &apos;s produced , it has a three-minute half-life , and degrades rapidly at room temperature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin , have to grab it fast and keep it cold ."
I think I can do that .
"Now luckily , oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood , so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery ."
Then I had to measure morality .
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project .
So I started smaller .
I studied one single virtue : trustworthiness .
Why ? I had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous .
"So in these countries , more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created , alleviating poverty ."
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
"So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , I might help alleviate poverty ."
But I &apos;m also a skeptic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; Are you trustworthy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research ."
"If you &apos;re so virtuous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we recruit some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they agree to show up .
"We give them lots of instruction , and we never ever deceive them ."
Then we match them in pairs by computer .
"And in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot; &quot; The trick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person &apos;s account .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot wealthier .
And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
"Do you want to keep it all , or do you want to send some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for minute .
You &apos;re going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half .
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?
So this was the birth of vampire economics .
Make a decision and give me some blood .
"So in fact , experimental economists had run this test around the world , and for much higher stakes , and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness ."
"But in fact , economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money ."
"They assumed money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money , and of those who received money , 95 percent returned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received , the more their brain produced oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on board , the more money they returned ."
So we have a biology of trustworthiness .
But wait . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
Two things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .
"So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effect ."
But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly ."
I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler .
"So along with colleagues in Zurich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger — all without altering mood or cognition ."
"So oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?"
"Using the oxytocin inhaler , we ran more studies ."
We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent .
We showed it increases donations to charity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
"These include massage , dancing and praying ."
"Yes , my mom was happy about that last one ."
"And whenever we raise oxytocin , people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin ?
"To investigate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has terminal brain cancer ."
"After they watched the video , we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .
So it &apos;s empathy that makes us connect to other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in 1759 called &quot; &quot; The Theory of Moral Sentiments . &quot; &quot; In this book , Smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social creatures , so we share the emotions of others ."
"So if I do something that hurts you , I feel that pain ."
So I tend to avoid that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your joy ."
So I tend to do those things .
"Now this is the same Adam Smith who , 17 years later , would write a little book called &quot; &quot; The Wealth of Nations &quot; &quot; — the founding document of economics ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the molecule behind it .
"But knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it tells us why we see immorality ."
"So to investigate immorality , let me bring you back now to 1980 ."
"I &apos;m working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara , California ."
"You sit in a gas station all day , you see lots of morality and immorality , let me tell you ."
"So one Sunday afternoon , a man walks into my cashier &apos;s booth with this beautiful jewelry box ."
Opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very valuable .
"We have to find the owner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yea . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to decide what to do with this , and the phone rings ."
"And a man says very excitedly , &quot; &quot; I was in your gas station a while ago , and I bought this jewelry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Pearl necklace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; &quot; Hey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re saving my life . Here &apos;s my phone number ."
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 reward . &quot; &quot; Great , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; Look , relax ."
"Get yourself a fat reward . Life &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; Again he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so nice , let &apos;s split the reward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the jewelry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was conned ."
"So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and I was the pigeon ."
"So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him , it &apos;s that he shows he trusts the victim ."
Now we know what happens .
"The victim &apos;s brain releases oxytocin , and you &apos;re opening up your wallet or purse , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
"We found , testing thousands of individuals , that five percent of the population don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus ."
"So if you trust them , their brains don &apos;t release oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a technical word for these people in my lab .
We call them bastards .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a beer with .
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited .
One is through improper nurturing .
"So we &apos;ve studied sexually abused women , and about half those don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus ."
You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly .
"Also , high stress inhibits oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really stressed out , we &apos;re not acting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting — through the action of testosterone ."
"So we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men ."
"And instead of sharing money , they become selfish ."
"But interestingly , high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own biology , we have the yin and yang of morality ."
"We have oxytocin that connects us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have testosterone .
"And men have 10 times the testosterone as women , so men do this more than women — we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally ."
We don &apos;t need God or government telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wondering : these are beautiful laboratory experiments , do they really apply to real life ?"
"Yeah , I &apos;ve been worrying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives .
"So last summer , I attended a wedding in Southern England ."
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall .
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes .
And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .
( Laughter ) And guess what ?
"Weddings cause a release of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
The bride .
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
"Her mother , that &apos;s right ."
Her mother was number two .
"Then the groom &apos;s father , then the groom , then the family , then the friends — arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun ."
"So I think it tells us that we &apos;ve designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple , connect us emotionally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn &apos;t really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .
"So even though I have a fear of heights , I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft ."
"I took my blood before and after , and I had a huge spike of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can connect to people .
"For example , through social media ."
Many people are Tweeting right now .
So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System .
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .
"And one of these guys , he must have been 22 , he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin ."
"I mean , astounding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social media in private .
"When I wrote my report to the Koreans , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend ."
They checked .
He was interacting on his girlfriend &apos;s Facebook page .
There you go . That &apos;s connection .
"So there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal ."
"Two weeks ago , I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands — very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia ."
There are 800 different languages in the highlands .
These are the most primitive people in the world .
And they indeed also release oxytocin .
So oxytocin connects us to other people .
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s brains to release oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my favorite way to do it is , in fact , the easiest ."
Let me show it to you .
Come here . Give me a hug .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr. Love .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your prescription from Dr. Love : eight hugs a day ."
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .
And they &apos;re happier because they have better relationships of all types .
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day .
Eight hugs a day — you &apos;ll be happier and the world will be a better place .
"Of course , if you don &apos;t like to touch people , I can always shove this up your nose ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
Maybe you remember .
"Every day , we heard devastating reports from the war in Iraq ."
There were waves of terror rolling across the globe .
It seemed like humanity was spinning out of control .
"We were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies , in politics , in religion , in populations ."
Everything felt so precarious .
"And I remember thinking , &quot; &quot; My God , what kind of world did we bring this child into ?"
"And as we entered the 21st century , it was very clear that religious extremism was once again on the rise ."
"And even when religion-related extremism does not lead to violence , it is still used as a political wedge issue , cynically leading people to justify the subordination of women , the stigmatization of LGBT people , racism , Islamophobia and anti-Semitism ."
We need to call this what it is : a great failure of religion .
"But the thing is , this isn &apos;t even the only challenge that religion faces today ."
Let me explain what I mean like this .
"One of the great blessings of being a rabbi is standing under the chuppah , under the wedding canopy , with a couple , and helping them proclaim publicly and make holy the love that they found for one another ."
"That &apos;s when we find ourselves in endless , mindless repetitions of words that don &apos;t mean anything to us , rising and being seated because someone has asked us to , holding onto jealously guarded doctrine that &apos;s completely and wildly out of step with our contemporary reality , engaging in perfunctory practice simply because that &apos;s the way things have always been done ."
Religion is waning in the United States .
"Now , we had no money , no space , no game plan , but we did have email ."
So my friend Melissa and I sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues .
"It basically said this : &quot; &quot; Before you bail on religion , why don &apos;t we come together this Friday night and see what we might make of our own Jewish inheritance ? &quot; &quot; We hoped maybe 20 people would show up ."
It turned out 135 people came .
"They were cynics and seekers , atheists and rabbis ."
Many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience in their entire lives .
"There are Jewish and Christian and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders , many of them women , by the way , who have set out to reclaim the heart of our traditions , who firmly believe that now is the time for religion to be part of the solution ."
"And while the theologies and the practices vary very much between these independent communities , what we can see are some common , consistent threads between them ."
I &apos;m going to share with you four of those commitments now .
The first is wakefulness .
We live in a time today in which we have unprecedented access to information about every global tragedy that happens on every corner of this Earth .
We all saw this picture .
We saw this picture of a five-year-old child pulled out of the rubble of his building in Aleppo .
"And once we see these images , we are called to a certain kind of action ."
This is extremely difficult to do .
"Psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what &apos;s broken in our world , the less likely we are to do anything ."
"The second principle is hope , and I want to say this about hope ."
"Hope is not naive , and hope is not an opiate ."
&quot; &quot; I need you . You need me .
"It &apos;s supposed to be about giving people back a sense of purpose , a sense of hope , a sense that they and their dreams fundamentally matter in this world that tells them that they don &apos;t matter at all ."
The third principle is the principle of mightiness .
There &apos;s a rabbinic tradition that we are to walk around with two slips of paper in our pockets .
"One says , &quot; &quot; I am but dust and ashes . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not all about me ."
"I can &apos;t control everything , and I cannot do this on my own ."
"The other slip of paper says , &quot; &quot; For my sake the world was created . &quot; &quot; Which is to say it &apos;s true that I can &apos;t do everything , but I can surely do something ."
I can forgive .
I can love .
I can show up .
I can protest .
I can be a part of this conversation .
It &apos;s a sign of total submission .
"Now in our community , when we get up off the ground , we stand with our hands raised to the heavens , and we say , &quot; &quot; I am strong , I am mighty , and I am worthy ."
The fourth and final is interconnectedness .
"He took a picture of it and posted it up on social media , and a Japanese teenager contacted him ."
How small our world has become .
It &apos;s so hard for us to remember how interconnected we all are as human beings .
Let me tell you how this works .
"And guess what ? Transphobia and Islamophobia and racism of all forms , those are also all of our problems ."
And so too is anti-Semitism all of our problems .
Because Emma Lazarus was right .
"Our hearts hurt from the failed religion of extremism , and we deserve more than the failed religion of routine-ism ."
"It is time for religious leaders and religious communities to take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift that this country and the world so desperately needs — a shift toward love , toward justice , toward equality and toward dignity for all ."
I believe that our children deserve no less than that .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Democracy .
"In the West , we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted ."
"We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is , but we see it as part of our society &apos;s furniture ."
We tend to think of it as an intransigent given .
We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
It doesn &apos;t .
"Singapore &apos;s Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism , spectacular growth , while politics remains democracy-free ."
"Indeed , democracy is receding in our neck of the woods , here in Europe ."
"Earlier this year , while I was representing Greece — the newly elected Greek government — in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister , I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation &apos;s democratic process — our elections — could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece ."
"Tonight , here , I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy ."
"And without democracy , our societies will be nastier , our future bleak and our great , new technologies wasted ."
"Speaking of waste , allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak ."
I call it the twin peaks paradox .
We all recognize the mountain of debts .
But few people discern its twin .
"A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations , too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs , like green energy ."
Now let me give you two numbers .
"Over the last three months , in the United States , in Britain and in the Eurozone , we have invested , collectively , 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods — things like industrial plants , machinery , office blocks , schools , roads , railways , machinery , and so on and so forth ."
"So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks , failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets ."
"And consequently , low aggregate demand , which in a never-ending cycle , reinforces the pessimism of the investors , who , fearing low demand , reproduce it by not investing — exactly like Oedipus &apos; father , who , terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him , unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus , his son , would kill him ."
This is my quarrel with capitalism .
Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer ?
"I believe so , but before we move on , what do we mean by democracy ?"
"Now , of course Athenian democracy excluded too many ."
"Women , migrants and , of course , the slaves ."
But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded .
"Now , of course , Athenian democracy didn &apos;t last long ."
"Like a candle that burns brightly , it burned out quickly ."
"And indeed , our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens ."
"They have their roots in the Magna Carta , in the 1688 Glorious Revolution , indeed in the American constitution ."
"Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor , our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition , which was , after all , a charter for masters ."
"And indeed , liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere , so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere , leaving the economic sphere — the corporate world , if you want — as a democracy-free zone ."
"Now , in our democracies today , this separation of the economic from the political sphere , the moment it started happening , it gave rise to an inexorable , epic struggle between the two , with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere , eating into its power ."
Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be ?
It &apos;s not because their DNA has degenerated .
"( Laughter ) It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere , which is separate ."
"Indeed , I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism ."
"If you think about it , it is a little bit like a population of predators , that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on , that in the end they starve ."
"Similarly , the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself , causing economic crisis ."
"Corporate power is increasing , political goods are devaluing , inequality is rising , aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations ."
"Now , this is not an original idea ."
"The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go very well , did it ?"
"The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered , as they were in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brutality and waste ."
But there is a solution : eliminate the working poor .
"Capitalism &apos;s doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata , androids , robots ."
"The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate , automation makes the twin peaks taller , the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper , including — soon , I believe — in places like China ."
"So we need to reconfigure , we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres , but we &apos;d better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere , lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix , the movie , look like a documentary ."
( Laughter ) So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning .
"The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society , where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient , Athenian-like , high tech agora ."
I think we can afford to be optimistic .
"In practical terms , allow me to share just briefly , a couple of examples ."
"At the level of the enterprise , imagine a capital market , where you earn capital as you work , and where your capital follows you from one job to another , from one company to another , and the company — whichever one you happen to work at at that time — is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment ."
"Then all income stems from capital , from profits , and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete ."
"No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company ; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor ; no great gap between investment and saving ; indeed , no towering twin peaks ."
"At the level of the global political economy , imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate , with a universal , global , digital currency , one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund , the G-20 , on behalf of all humanity ."
"And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency — let &apos;s call it &quot; &quot; the cosmos , &quot; &quot; in units of cosmos — with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country &apos;s trade deficit , or indeed to a country &apos;s trade surplus ."
"And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce ."
This is not a new idea .
"It &apos;s what , effectively , John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference ."
"The problem is that back then , they didn &apos;t have the technology to implement it ."
"Now we do , especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere ."
"The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian , in that it prioritizes empowered individuals , Marxist , since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor , and Keynesian , global Keynesian ."
"But above all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy ."
Will such a world dawn ?
Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia ?
The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively .
"It is our choice , and we &apos;d better make it democratically ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Yanis ...
It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist .
What is the relevance of Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
"Yanis Varoufakis : Well , if there was any relevance in what I just said , then Marx is relevant ."
"With this crisis migrating from one part of the world , as it is now , it will destabilize not only our democracies , but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy ."
"So if this analysis holds water , then Marx is absolutely relevant ."
"But so is Hayek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a libertarian Marxist , and so is Keynes , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally confused ."
"( Laughter ) BG : Indeed , and possibly we are too , now . ( Laughter )"
"( Applause ) YV : If you are not confused , you are not thinking , OK ?"
"BG : That &apos;s a very , very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say — YV : That was Einstein , actually — BG : During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China , and last night at the speaker dinner , you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China ."
Would you like to share that ?
"YV : Well , there &apos;s a great degree of hypocrisy ."
"In our liberal democracies , we have a semblance of democracy ."
"In a sense , if I am allowed to be provocative , China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century ."
"Liberalism , liberal , it &apos;s like John Stuart Mill ."
John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process .
"So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second ."
"And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century , smacks of hypocrisy ."
BG : I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year .
YV : I knew this was coming .
"BG : Six months after , how do you look back at the first half of the year ?"
"YV : Extremely exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone ."
"Not just Greece , the Eurozone ."
"To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive — and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone , which is threatening , massively , the whole of the European Union process ."
"And , unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , in the Eurogroup , chose to maintain denial ."
But you know what happens .
This is the experience of the Soviet Union .
BG : What kind of change are you foreseeing ?
"YV : Well , there &apos;s no doubt that if we don &apos;t change the architecture of the Eurozone , the Eurozone has no future ."
BG : Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister ?
YV : Every day .
"If there &apos;s any Minister of Finance , or of anything else for that matter , who tells you after six months in a job , especially in such a stressful situation , that they have made no mistake , they &apos;re dangerous people ."
Of course I made mistakes .
I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground .
And there wasn &apos;t .
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP .
This is worse than the Great Depression .
YV : Absolutely .
"Look , my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe ."
My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive .
"Because if it doesn &apos;t , the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic , and they will destroy the European Union ."
And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy .
"And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930 &apos;s , which seems to me to be what we are doing , then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike ."

"When I was nine years old , I went off to summer camp for the first time ."
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books .
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were .
"And at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world &apos;s loss ."
"Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best ."
So that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
"So even if you &apos;re an extrovert yourself , I &apos;m talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now — all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society ."
"Now , to see the bias clearly , you need to understand what introversion is ."
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
"Introversion is more about , how do you respond to stimulation , including social stimulation ."
"Our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts &apos; need for lots of stimulation ."
"We sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously ."
And kids are working in countless group assignments .
"( Laughter ) Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces ."
"Now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers ."
"And what I &apos;m saying is that culturally , we need a much better balance ."
"And in fact , we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude ."
It &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve strangely begun to forget it .
"This is no surprise , though , if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology ."
"It turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring , mimicking their opinions ."
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
"Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always favored the man of action over the &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; of contemplation ."
"So , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important ."
"Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant , and I &apos;m also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
"We need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own ."
"Be like Buddha , have your own revelations ."
"Whatever it is , I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy ."
"Hi , my name is Marcin — farmer , technologist ."
"I was born in Poland , now in the U.S."
I started a group called Open Source Ecology .
"We &apos;ve identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist — things from tractors , bread ovens , circuit makers ."
"Then we set out to create an open source , DIY , do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost ."
We call this the Global Village Construction Set .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy , and I discovered I was useless ."
I had no practical skills .
"The world presented me with options , and I took them ."
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle .
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming .
I bought a tractor — then it broke .
I paid to get it repaired — then it broke again .
"Then pretty soon , I was broke too ."
"I realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn &apos;t exist yet ."
"I needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low-cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence ."
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I tested them .
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale .
"So then I published the 3D designs , schematics , instructional videos and budgets on a wiki ."
"Then contributors from all over the world began showing up , prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits ."
"So far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines ."
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity .
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
We &apos;re focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people &apos;s lives in such tangible material ways .
"If we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing , then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential ."
That &apos;s not only in the developing world .
"Our tools are being made for the American farmer , builder , entrepreneur , maker ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of excitement from these people , who can now start a construction business , parts manufacturing , organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid ."
"Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear , so complete , that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit ."
I &apos;ve planted a hundred trees in a day .
"I &apos;ve pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days ."
"From what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant ."
"A greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity ."
We &apos;re exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology .
Thank you .

"In non-professional circles outside America , it &apos;s largely ignored ."
"If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself , I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to have to look at my books , which you won &apos;t find in the bookstore outside ."
Don &apos;t be fooled . There &apos;s nothing new about ID .
"It &apos;s not a thing I often do , so listen carefully ."
I think they &apos;re right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion .
The God theory is not just a bad theory .
"It has certain ideas at the heart of it , which we call &apos; sacred &apos; or &apos; holy . &apos; What it means is : here is an idea or a notion that you &apos;re not allowed to say anything bad about ."
"Now , the next one ."
Mr. Bush &apos;s reply has become infamous .
"&quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots ."
The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading .
Why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
About 20 percent are agnostic ; the rest could fairly be called atheists .
"Among biological scientists , the figure is even lower : 5.5 percent , only , believe in God ."
"I &apos;ve not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such as history or philosophy , but I &apos;d be surprised if they were different ."
"From what I &apos;ve seen of TED , I think this may be the ideal place to launch it ."
"In most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists ."
"There should be a snowball effect , a positive feedback , such that the more names we have , the more we get ."
It &apos;s not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse .
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .
My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism .

"( Music ) Roughly 43,000 years ago , a young cave bear died in the rolling hills on the northwest border of modern day Slovenia ."
"A thousand years later , a mammoth died in southern Germany ."
"A few centuries after that , a griffon vulture also died in the same vicinity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths , but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space did share one remarkable fate ."
"After their deaths , a bone from each of their skeletons was crafted by human hands into a flute ."
Think about that for a second .
"It seems preposterous that you would invent the flute , a tool that created useless vibrations in air molecules ."
But that is exactly what our ancestors did .
Now this turns out to be surprisingly common in the history of innovation .
"But just as often , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fun ."
"And here &apos;s the really strange thing : many of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions ended up sparking momentous transformations in science , in politics and society ."
Take what may be the most important invention of modern times : programmable computers .
"Someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our fingers , inventing the first musical keyboard ."
"Now , keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords to harpsichords to the piano , until the middle of the 19th century , when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters ."
"In fact , the very first typewriter was originally called &quot; &quot; the writing harpsichord . &quot; &quot; Flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs ."
"About a thousand years ago , at the height of the Islamic Renaissance , three brothers in Baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the instrument that plays itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the instrument was basically a giant music box ."
The organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder .
"And if you wanted the machine to play a different song , you just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it ."
This instrument was the first of its kind .
It was programmable .
"Now , conceptually , this was a massive leap forward ."
The whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention .
"And that incredibly powerful concept didn &apos;t come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest , or necessity at all ."
It came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music .
"In fact , the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years ."
"In the 1700s , music-making machines became the playthings of the Parisian elite ."
"Showmen used the same coded cylinders to control the physical movements of what were called automata , an early kind of robot ."
"And as de Vaucanson was designing his robot musician , he had another idea ."
"If you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds , why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth ?"
"If you wanted a new pattern for your fabric , you just programmed a new cylinder ."
This was the first programmable loom .
Paper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible as a way of programming the device .
"That punch card system inspired Victorian inventor Charles Babbage to create his analytical engine , the first true programmable computer ever designed ."
So ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
"Yes , the military involvement is an important part of the story , but inventing a computer also required other building blocks : music boxes , toy robot flute players , harpsichord keyboards , colorful patterns woven into fabric , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
"There &apos;s a long list of world-changing ideas and technologies that came out of play : public museums , rubber , probability theory , the insurance business and many more ."
Necessity isn &apos;t always the mother of invention .
"The playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory , seeking out new possibilities in the world around us ."
And that seeking is why so many experiences that started with simple delight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs .
"Now , I think this has implications for how we teach kids in school and how we encourage innovation in our workspaces , but thinking about play and delight this way also helps us detect what &apos;s coming next ."
"Think about it : if you were sitting there in 1750 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th , the 20th centuries , automated machines , computers , artificial intelligence , a programmable flute entertaining the Parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time ."
You &apos;ll find the future wherever people are having the most fun .
Everyone needs a coach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player ."
"( Laughter ) My bridge coach , Sharon Osberg , says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else &apos;s in the world . ( Laughter ) Sorry , Sharon . Here you go ."
We all need people who will give us feedback .
That &apos;s how we improve .
"Unfortunately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better , and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get , we were blown away ."
"Until recently , over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback : Satisfactory ."
"If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; satisfactory , &quot; &quot; I would have no hope of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differently ?
"Today , districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers , but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice ."
Our teachers deserve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fair to them .
"It &apos;s not fair to students , and it &apos;s putting America &apos;s global leadership at risk ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , unfortunately there &apos;s no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems ."
"So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically , and looked at what they &apos;re doing to help their teachers improve ."
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland .
"Now , out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading , how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve ?"
Eleven out of 14 .
"The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading , but we &apos;re 23rd in science and 31st in math ."
"So there &apos;s really only one area where we &apos;re near the top , and that &apos;s in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills ."
"Let &apos;s look at the best academic performer : the province of Shanghai , China ."
"Now , they rank number one across the board , in reading , math and science , and one of the keys to Shanghai &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving ."
They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
"They have weekly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much variation in the teaching profession .
Some teachers are far more effective than others .
"In fact , there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blowing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching ."
We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices .
"For example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?"
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea ?
"We also had students fill out surveys with questions like , &quot; &quot; Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you learn to correct your mistakes ? &quot;"
And what we found is very exciting .
"First , the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes ."
So it tells us we &apos;re asking the right questions .
"And second , teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools , because they pointed to specific places where they can improve ."
I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action .
( Music ) ( Video ) Sarah Brown Wessling : Good morning everybody .
Let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s going on today .
"To get started , we &apos;re doing a peer review day , okay ?"
"A peer review day , and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays ."
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling .
"I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston , Iowa ."
Turn to somebody next to you .
Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove . I &apos;ve talk about — I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it .
"Okay , so I would like you to please bring up your papers ."
I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality .
"You can &apos;t really dispute what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this ."
I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens .
"At the beginning of class , I just perch it in the back of the classroom . It &apos;s not a perfect shot ."
It doesn &apos;t catch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
But I can hear the sound . I can see a lot .
And I &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection .
"All right , let &apos;s take a look at the long one first , okay ?"
"Once I &apos;m finished taping , then I put it in my computer , and then I &apos;ll scan it and take a peek at it ."
"If I don &apos;t write things down , I don &apos;t remember them ."
"So having the notes is a part of my thinking process , and I discover what I &apos;m seeing as I &apos;m writing ."
"I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management , and just all of those different facets of the classroom ."
"I &apos;m glad that we &apos;ve actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works , what doesn &apos;t ."
"I think that video exposes so much of what &apos;s intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand , and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about ."
"I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan , things you cannot convey in a standard , things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy ."
"Alrighty , everybody , have a great weekend ."
I &apos;ll see you later .
"&#91; Every classroom could look like that &#93; ( Applause ) Bill Gates : One day , we &apos;d like every classroom in America to look something like that ."
But we still have more work to do .
Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle .
We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis .
"If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions , you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions ."
So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won &apos;t be easy .
"For example , I know some teachers aren &apos;t immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom ."
"That &apos;s understandable , but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to submit , a lot of them will be eager to participate ."
Building this system will also require a considerable investment .
Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars .
"Now that &apos;s a big number , but to put it in perspective , it &apos;s less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries ."
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
"We would finally have a way to give them feedback , as well as the means to act on it ."
But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country .
"It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education , find a career that &apos;s fulfilling and rewarding , and have a chance to live out their dreams ."
This wouldn &apos;t just make us a more successful country .
"It would also make us a more fair and just one , too ."
I &apos;m excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve .
I hope you are too .
Thank you .

"A year ago , I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing , that has come out in the interim , and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired ."
"The book is called &quot; &quot; The Blank Slate , &quot; &quot; based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate , and that all of its structure comes from socialization , culture , parenting , experience ."
The &quot; &quot; blank slate &quot; &quot; was an influential idea in the 20th century .
"Here are a few quotes indicating that : &quot; &quot; Man has no nature , &quot; &quot; from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset ; &quot; &quot; Man has no instincts , &quot; &quot; from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu ; &quot; &quot; The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none , &quot; &quot; from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould ."
"There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate , and some of them just come from common sense ."
"As many people have told me over the years , anyone who &apos;s had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents ; it doesn &apos;t all come from the outside ."
And anyone who &apos;s ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable .
"There are also , I think , increasing results from the scientific study of humans that , indeed , we &apos;re not born blank slates ."
"One of them , from anthropology , is the study of human universals ."
"If you &apos;ve ever taken anthropology , you know that it &apos;s a — kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be , and that there are places out there where , supposedly , everything is the opposite to the way it is here ."
"But if you instead look at what is common to the world &apos;s cultures , you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world &apos;s 6,000-odd cultures ."
"The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all , and they range from aesthetics , affection and age statuses all the way down to weaning , weapons , weather , attempts to control , the color white and a worldview ."
"Also , genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured ."
"This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they — using MRI — measured the distribution of gray matter — that is , the outer layer of the cortex — in a large sample of pairs of people ."
"They coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme , in which no difference is coded as purple , and any color other than purple indicates a statistically significant correlation ."
"Well , this is what happens when you pair people up at random ."
"By definition , two people picked at random can &apos;t have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex ."
This is what happens in people who share half of their DNA — fraternal twins .
"And as you can see , large amounts of the brain are not purple , showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region , so does his fraternal twin ."
And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter .
"Now , these aren &apos;t just differences in anatomy , like the shape of your ear lobes , but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams : &quot; Separated at birth , the Mallifert twins meet accidentally . &quot;"
"As you can see , there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap , meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney ."
"Now , the cartoon is not such an exaggeration , because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities ."
And this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied — but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth .
"My favorite example is a pair of twins , one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany , the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad ."
"Now — the story might seem to good to be true , but when you administer batteries of psychological tests , you get the same results — namely , identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities ."
"Now , given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question , why should it have been such an appealing notion ?"
"Well , there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial ."
"The foremost is that if we &apos;re blank slates , then , by definition , we are equal , because zero equals zero equals zero ."
"But if something is written on the slate , then some people could have more of it than others , and according to this line of thinking , that would justify discrimination and inequality ."
"Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates , we can perfect mankind — the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering ."
"Whereas , if we &apos;re born with certain instincts , then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness , prejudice and violence ."
"Well , in the book , I argue that these are , in fact , non sequiturs ."
"And just to make a long story short : first of all , the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness ."
"And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence , &quot; &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , &quot; &quot; he did not mean &quot; &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are clones . &quot; &quot; Rather , that all men are equal in terms of their rights , and that every person ought to be treated as an individual , and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to ."
"Also , even if we were born with certain ignoble motives , they don &apos;t automatically lead to ignoble behavior ."
"That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts , and some of them can inhibit others ."
"For example , there &apos;s excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense , and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history ."
"So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed , that &apos;s not the only thing in the skull , and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them ."
"In the book , I go over controversies such as this one , and a number of other hot buttons , hot zones , Chernobyls , third rails , and so on — including the arts , cloning , crime , free will , education , evolution , gender differences , God , homosexuality , infanticide , inequality , Marxism , morality , Nazism , parenting , politics , race , rape , religion , resource depletion , social engineering , technological risk and war ."
"And needless to say , there were certain risks in taking on these subjects ."
"When I wrote a first draft of the book , I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments , and here are some of the reactions that I got : &quot; Better get a security camera for your house . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t expect to get any more awards , job offers or positions in scholarly societies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio . &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you have tenure ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Well , the book came out in October , and nothing terrible has happened ."
"I — I like — There was indeed reason to be nervous , and there were moments in which I did feel nervous , knowing the history of what has happened to people who &apos;ve taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences ."
"There are many cases , some of which I talk about in the book , of people who have been slandered , called Nazis , physically assaulted , threatened with criminal prosecution for stumbling across or arguing about controversial findings ."
And you never know when you &apos;re going to come across one of these booby traps .
"My favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on left-handers , and published some data showing that left-handers are , on average , more susceptible to disease , more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan ."
"It &apos;s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate generalization , but the data at the time seemed to support that ."
"Well , pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters , death threats , ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals , coming from irate left-handers and their advocates , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired . Well ,"
"the night is young , but the book has been out for half a year , and nothing terrible has happened ."
None of the dire professional consequences has taken place — I haven &apos;t been exiled from the city of Cambridge .
But what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80-odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received .
"I &apos;ll just put that list up for a few seconds , and see if you can guess which two — I would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably 90 percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews ."
"It &apos;s not violence and war , it &apos;s not race , it &apos;s not gender , it &apos;s not Marxism , it &apos;s not Nazism ."
They are : the arts and parenting .
"( Laughter ) So let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and I &apos;ll let you decide if whether they — the claims are really that outrageous ."
Let me start with the arts .
I note that among the long list of human universals that I presented a few slides ago are art .
There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts .
Visual arts — decoration of surfaces and bodies — appears to be a human universal .
"The telling of stories , music , dance , poetry — found in all cultures , and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies : a preference for symmetrical forms , the use of repetition and variation , even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world , you have lines that are very close to three seconds long , separated by pauses ."
"Now , on the other hand , in the second half of the 20th century , the arts are frequently said to be in decline ."
"And I have a collection , probably 10 or 15 headlines , from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time ."
"I &apos;ll give you a couple of representative quotes : &quot; &quot; We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline , that the standards of culture are lower than they were 50 years ago , and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a quote from T. S. Eliot , a little more than 50 years ago ."
And a more recent one : &quot; &quot; The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical .
"Serious book stores are losing their franchise , nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory , symphony orchestras are diluting their programs , public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of British sitcoms , classical radio stations are dwindling , museums are resorting to blockbuster shows , dance is dying . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s from Robert Brustein , the famous drama critic and director , in The New Republic about five years ago ."
"Well , in fact , the arts are not in decline ."
"I don &apos;t think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room , but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent ."
"There are , of course , entirely new art forms and new media , many of which you &apos;ve heard over these few days ."
The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres .
"One of them is in elite art since the 1930s — say , the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras , where most of the repertory is before 1930 , or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums ."
"In literary criticism and analysis , probably 40 or 50 years ago , literary critics were a kind of cultural hero ; now they &apos;re kind of a national joke ."
"And the humanities and arts programs in the universities , which by many measures , indeed are in decline ."
"Students are staying away in droves , universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities ."
"Well , here &apos;s a diagnosis ."
"They didn &apos;t ask me , but by their own admission , they need all the help that they can get ."
And I would like to suggest that it &apos;s not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature .
"A famous quotation can be found — if you look on the web , you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses — &quot; &quot; In or about December 1910 , human nature changed . &quot; &quot; A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf , and there &apos;s some debate as to what she actually meant by that ."
"But it &apos;s very clear , looking at these syllabuses , that — it &apos;s used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries , or millennia , in the 20th century were discarded ."
"The beauty and pleasure in art — probably a human universal — were — began to be considered saccharine , or kitsch , or commercial ."
Barnett Newman had a famous quote that &quot; &quot; the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty &quot; &quot; — which was considered bourgeois or tacky .
And here &apos;s just one example .
"I mean , this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century ; here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century ."
"And , as you can see , there — something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses ."
"Indeed , in movements of modernism and post-modernism , there was visual art without beauty , literature without narrative and plot , poetry without meter and rhyme , architecture and planning without ornament , human scale , green space and natural light , music without melody and rhythm , and criticism without clarity , attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition ."
( Laughter ) Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement .
"But here , there — one of the most famous literary English scholars of our time is the Berkeley professor , Judith Butler ."
"And here is an example of one of her analyses : &quot; &quot; The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition , convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure , and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ... &quot; &quot; Well , you get the idea ."
"By the way , this is one sentence — you can actually parse it ."
"Well , the argument in &quot; &quot; The Blank Slate &quot; &quot; was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have disdained beauty , pleasure , clarity , insight and style ."
People are staying away from elite art and criticism .
What a puzzle — I wonder why .
"Well , this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book ."
Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on . I won &apos;t comment on that .
But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
"Well , the other hot button is parenting ."
And the starting point is the — for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex .
"Now , here is — here is a representative quote from a besieged mother : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m overwhelmed with parenting advice ."
I &apos;m supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they &apos;ll grow up to be healthy adults .
And I &apos;m supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they &apos;ll grow up smart .
"And there are all kinds of play — clay for finger dexterity , word games for reading success , large motor play , small motor play . I feel like I could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids . &quot; &quot; I think anyone who &apos;s recently been a parent can sympathize with this mother ."
"Well , here &apos;s some sobering facts about parenting ."
"Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless . They &apos;re useless because they don &apos;t control for heritability . They measure some correlation between what the parents do , how the children turn out and assume a causal relation : that the parenting shaped the child ."
"Parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate , parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on ."
And very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for — that increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on .
"Until the studies are redone with adoptive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid ."
The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results .
"Remember the Mallifert twins : separated at birth , then they meet in the patent office — remarkably similar ."
"Well , what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together ?"
"You might think , well , then they &apos;d be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment ."
"That would make them super-similar , right ?"
"Wrong . Identical twins , or any siblings , who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together ."
Everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect .
"A complementary finding , from a completely different methodology , is that adopted siblings reared together — the mirror image of identical twins reared apart , they share their parents , their home , their neighborhood , don &apos;t share their genes — end up not similar at all ."
OK — two different bodies of research with a similar finding .
"What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run , but in part — only in part — by their genes , in part by their culture — the culture of the country at large and the children &apos;s own culture , namely their peer group — as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today , that &apos;s what kids care about — and , to a very large extent , larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge , by chance : chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero ; chance events as you live your life ."
So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices .
"I think that the sciences of human nature — behavioral genetics , evolutionary psychology , neuroscience , cognitive science — are going to , increasingly in the years to come , upset various dogmas , careers and deeply-held political belief systems ."
And that presents us with a choice .
"I have my own answer to that question , which comes from a great artist of the 19th century , Anton Chekhov , who said , &quot; &quot; Man will become better when you show him what he is like . &quot; &quot; And I think that the argument can &apos;t be put any more eloquently than that ."
Thank you very much .
