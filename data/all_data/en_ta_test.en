"Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors ."
"We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes ."
"And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family ."
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
"And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands ."
And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out ."
This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
"So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital ."
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
"And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it ."
"The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures ."
"So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide ."
"And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out ."
"And at the slightest sound , they hide back again ."
So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
"So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do ."
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
"So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on ."
So this is a very early prototype .
"Of course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them ."
This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
"So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
"On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible ."
Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall ."
"And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun ."
"And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak ."
"So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around ."
"But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion ."
"And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
"His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant ."
Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
"Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wires .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object ."
"And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up ."
"So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics ."
"And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
"So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling ."
"And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume ."
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
"And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake ."
Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
Even the BBC and The New York Times .
"So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication ."
"When we think about communication , we think about interactions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
"And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date ."
"For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued ."
"If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?"
"We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology ."
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics ."
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
"So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up ."
It &apos;s about opening up .
"This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them ."
"So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?"
"When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out ."
"You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it ."
I notice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
"Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising ."
"And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade ."
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
"So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?"
"And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
"So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
"But really , power is also about how you react to stress ."
"So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?"
"Probably not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind ."
"So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
"So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
"So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"Also , our bodies change our minds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations ."
"Again , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled ."
People hate this .
"We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them ."
They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect ."
"So I said , fake it till you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
"When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident ."
"I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times ."
I was thrown from the car .
"I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college ."
I am an impostor .
"You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling ."
"Like , she can fake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it ."
Fake it till you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
"Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity ."
"Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful ."
"Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea ."
"( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so ."
"Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable ."
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
"Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic ."
This is a time of need .
"Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly ."
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
"( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk ."
"Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things ."
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
"Sure , she had aged a little ."
"In fact , she had aged a lot ."
But he felt all his old passion for her return .
"&quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name ."
"&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name ."
"&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here ."
"Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other ."
"Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer ."
The earth moved for both of them .
And they lived together happily ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
"( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate ."
The moral imperative is on the table .
"Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp ."
To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
"So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community ."
Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
( Applause )
"Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
I want to know how I impact them .
I want to know how they impact me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it restorative seafood .
"Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress ."
"Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency ."
"It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment ."
Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
"Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species ."
"The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list ."
We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
But what if we eat only in the green list ?
You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
Pole caught — no bycatch .
Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors ."
"The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this ."
Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
"Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well folks , we have a protein problem ."
"We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost ."
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
"Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant ."
Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
"We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all ."
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
"It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake ."
Whooo !
This is an easy sell .
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
There &apos;s a pattern here .
Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
We have eco-friendly shrimp .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
"While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood ."
"Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood ."
That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
"As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone ."
"People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals ."
"People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein ."
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
They got healthier . I made more money .
This is great .
"Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon ."
"Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species ."
"We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options ."
This is what we need to favor .
This is what the green list says .
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
"But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
Put it on four plates .
"Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it ."
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
"Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe ."
I expect a lot from food .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
"I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests ."
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
I remember well the meals of my childhood .
"They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice ."
This is still how I largely eat today .
I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
I get the meat sweats .
It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
It &apos;s disgusting .
"But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
Eat your vegetables .
It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
So what are we looking for in a meal ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body ."
"For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank ."
But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore ."
We need to savor vegetables .
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
And we need to save dinner .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
"In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation ."
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
"And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell ."
You can see the bars of the window there .
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way ."
"And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done ."
"Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?"
"I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked ."
"I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist ."
I met him at a 46664 event .
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
"This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV ."
"And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
"It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive ."
They work in the field .
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
They have education programs .
They bring out the issues of stigma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
"And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds ."
"A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa ."
So this is my SING Campaign .
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money ."
"In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are ."
"Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary ."
This is in the Scottish Parliament .
I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
"And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness ."
"And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus ."
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
"And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach ."
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to ."
"And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus ."
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
"Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile ."
This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
"Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus ."
"And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby ."
"At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia ."
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
"So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the transformation that took place .
Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up ."
"I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?"
Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
"Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined ."
"Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn &apos;t some smart , new technological innovations ."
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
"Washing hands with soap , a habit we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by one third ."
"Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , trachoma , SARS , and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap ."
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
It stops babies from dying .
Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
"It can save over 600,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
So now just take a minute .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
"All right , get to know each other ."
"Pretty yucky , you would agree with me ."
"Well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fancy toilets , running water , and soap available , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high ."
What is it ? Is there no soap ?
"Actually , soap is available ."
"In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap ."
"Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
"Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?"
"His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cupboard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
What &apos;s the result of that ?
"Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes ."
Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life .
"However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in ."
"Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family ."
"Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand ."
Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
"It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers ."
Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
"And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages ."
The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera .
"Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment ."
"A hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading ."
"I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government ."
"Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities ."
The budget is not always there .
"And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior ."
"In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap ."
"Win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets ."
"And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable ."
"On October 15 , we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day ."
"Schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world &apos;s most important public health intervention ."
"What &apos;s required , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , creative thinking that drives advocacy ."
"If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign , we &apos;ve created great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them ."
We &apos;ve had over 30 million views .
Most of these discussions are still happening online .
I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
"I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries ."
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
"I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap ."
We run today the world &apos;s largest handwashing program by any public health standards .
We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
"Over the last four years , business has grown double digits , whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased ."
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
"Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need ."
"Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn ."
I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
This one is from Myanmar .
"She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance ."
"Her son , Myo , is her second one ."
"She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks , and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life , and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant , and that if soap is used before touching the babies , we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers ."
"And that &apos;s what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equip her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn ."
"And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
I hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like Myo reach their fifth birthday .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
It &apos;s awful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun ."
( Applause )
"Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied ."
"I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant ."
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
"The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management ."
"So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?"
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery ."
"In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients ."
"In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments ."
"After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses ."
"You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient ."
"So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down ."
"And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients ."
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
"At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;"
"Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost ."
We call this value-based healthcare .
"On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend ."
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
"On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters ."
"When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw ."
"You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse ."
The differences were dramatic .
"Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery ."
"Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again ."
You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference ."
"When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist ."
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lottery .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery ."
"To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip ."
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
"They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;"
And they finally agreed .
"And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data ."
"Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime ."
"They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country ."
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
"Since then , they publish every year ."
"Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?"
"And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement ."
"For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not ."
Now I found this principle really exciting .
"So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Continuous improvement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part ."
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
"In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden ."
"So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period ."
"Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
"OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries ."
"The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD ."
"Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country ."
"Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
"In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
"Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive ."
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
"And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physicians have another characteristic .
They actually thrive from peer recognition .
"If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to improve .
"So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows ."
"Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve ."
"Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM ."
"You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym ."
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
"We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer ."
The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden ."
Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe ."
"They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children ."
"The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?"
Can we measure it better than we do ?
"We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?"
"And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?"
There was an enormous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm ."
"At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution ."
"I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave ."
Thank you .

"I &apos;m really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most , what factors actually matter the most for startup success ."
I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
"If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup , you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible ."
You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
"But if the startup organization is so great , why do so many fail ?"
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success .
"And I wanted to try to be systematic about it , avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years ."
"I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been starting businesses since I was 12 years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school , to high school , when I made solar energy devices , to college , when I made loudspeakers ."
"And when I graduated from college , I started software companies ."
"And 20 years ago , I started Idealab , and in the last 20 years , we started more than 100 companies , many successes , and many big failures ."
We learned a lot from those failures .
So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure .
So I looked at these five .
"First , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the execution , adaptability , that mattered even more than the idea ."
"I never thought I &apos;d be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everybody has a plan , until they get punched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
So much about a team &apos;s execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer .
The customer is the true reality .
And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
Then I started looking at the business model .
Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
Then I looked at the funding .
Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding .
Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
"And then of course , the timing ."
Is the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
"Is it early , as in , you &apos;re in advance and you have to educate the world ?"
Is it just right ?
"Or is it too late , and there &apos;s already too many competitors ?"
So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies .
"And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies , and 100 non-Idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it ."
"So first , on these Idealab companies , the top five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — those all became billion-dollar successes ."
"And the five companies on the bottom — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we all had high hopes for , but didn &apos;t succeed ."
So I tried to rank across all of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions .
"And then for non-Idealab companies , I looked at wild successes , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn ."
"And some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Friendster ."
"The bottom companies had intense funding , they even had business models in some cases , but they didn &apos;t succeed ."
"I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies , and the results really surprised me ."
The number one thing was timing .
Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
"Team and execution came in second , and the idea , the differentiability of the idea , the uniqueness of the idea , that actually came in third ."
"Now , this isn &apos;t absolutely definitive , it &apos;s not to say that the idea isn &apos;t important , but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important thing ."
Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed .
"The last two , business model and funding , made sense to me actually ."
I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you &apos;re creating .
"And funding , I think as well , if you &apos;re underfunded at first but you &apos;re gaining traction , especially in today &apos;s age , it &apos;s very , very easy to get intense funding ."
So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these .
So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about .
"Well , that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger . &quot;"
"Of course , people proved that wrong ."
"But one of the reasons it succeeded , aside from a good business model , a good idea , great execution , is the timing ."
"That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money , and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger ."
Same thing with Uber .
"Uber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too ."
But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system .
"Drivers were looking for extra money ; it was very , very important ."
"Some of our early successes , Citysearch , came out when people needed web pages ."
"GoTo.com , which we announced actually at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic ."
"We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the timing was probably maybe more important ."
And then some of our failures .
"We started a company called Z.com , it was an online entertainment company ."
"We were so excited about it — we raised enough money , we had a great business model , we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company ."
But broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000 .
"It was too hard to watch video content online , you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff , and the company eventually went out of business in 2003 ."
"Just two years later , when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America , YouTube was perfectly timed ."
"Great idea , but unbelievable timing ."
"In fact , YouTube didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started ."
It wasn &apos;t even certain that that would work out .
"But that was beautifully , beautifully timed ."
"So what I would say , in summary , is execution definitely matters a lot ."
The idea matters a lot .
But timing might matter even more .
And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them .
"And to be really , really honest about it , not be in denial about any results that you see , because if you have something you love , you want to push it forward , but you have to be very , very honest about that factor on timing ."
"As I said earlier , I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place ."
"I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio , and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn &apos;t have happened otherwise ."
"Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience ."

I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
Everyone can be wrong .
"Life is a right , not collateral or casual ."
I will not forget where I come from .
I will craft my own drum .
"Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing ."
Our humming will be drumming .
I will not be played .
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
This heartbeat is louder than death .
Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
"Confused , aspiring pacifists ."
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
Like a lot .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
"I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping ."
"What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of ."
Poetry does that .
It preps you . It aims you .
So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
Hold her now with you .
"You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her ."
Are you holding her ?
This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
"Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past ."
"But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence ."
Whose son shall it be ?
Which male child will perish a new day ?
Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
We cherish corpses .
"We mourn women , complicated ."
Bitches get beat daily .
"Profits made , prophets ignored ."
"War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods ."
"All colors run , none of us solid ."
Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
I live cycles of light and darkness .
Rhythm is half silence .
"I see now , I never was one and not the other ."
"Sickness , health , tender violence ."
I think now I never was pure .
"Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am ."
"Human contracted itself blind , malignant ."
I never was pure .
Girl spoiled before ripened .
Language can &apos;t math me .
I experience exponentially .
Everything is everything .
"One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family ."
One woman loses six .
One woman loses her head .
One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
One woman straps herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives birth to borders .
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
One woman never did .
Where do refugee hearts go ?
"Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed ."
Faced with absence .
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
My spine curves spiral .
Precipice running to and running from human beings .
Cluster bombs left behind .
De facto landmines .
A smoldering grief .
Harvest contaminated tobacco .
Harvest bombs .
Harvest baby teeth .
"Harvest palms , smoke ."
"Harvest witness , smoke ."
"Resolutions , smoke ."
"Salvation , smoke ."
"Redemption , smoke ."
Breathe .
Do not fear what has blown up .
"If you must , fear the unexploded ."
Thank you .

"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
of sleep-deprived women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep ."
"Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion ."
"I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye ."
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
"And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue ."
"We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol ."
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship ."
"Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions ."
So a high I.Q.
"does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
"In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
